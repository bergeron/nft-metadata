    "description": "Sami contacted me late one evening and asked if I wanted to swing by and photograph her in a gold bunny mask. Sami styled a photoshoot earlier in the day and had purchased a mask which was never used. I've not seen Sami in some time, so it was easy for me to say \"yes\". \nGolden Hare is one of a few images we shot that night on 35mm film and will be the first of 1 of one's in The Velveteen Collection to be released, with my PFP source image, \"Bad Bunny\", to be the last.\nA museum quality framed print will be awarded to the collector for any sale exceeding 1eth. Overseas shipping to be paid by the recipient.\n10% of the sales with be going back to Sami.\nNot for commercial use.",
