    "description": "Lathmar Holi is a Hindu festival which means of \"Holi of sticks\". This festival is celebrated with lot of fervour and excitement in the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon, also known as the towns of Radha and Krishna respectively.\nAssociated with legend that is linked to the divine couple Radha Krishna, the festival seeks to recreate it. According to the legend, Lord Krishna who was resident of Nandgaon wanted to spray the colours on his beloved Radha and her friends to tease them on the day of Holi. But, as Krishna and his friends entered Barsana they were playfully greeted with the sticks by Radha and her friends who drove them out of Barsana. Following the same trend, every year men of Nandagaon visit Barsana during the time of Holi and are greeted by women who playfully hurl sticks (aka lathi) on men",
