    "description": "In this region of Brazil you can see nothing but green. In this region of Brazil, people live in peace, away from the noise and pollution of cities.\nNo human being who has never visited this area can imagine the amount of calm that exists here, here you can hear the sound of birds and the rustling of trees, even a phone and the Internet is not exists here. And the smell of flowers and trees something out of the imagination.\nIn this picture there are many things. All of these things are used by the farmers who live in this area. Do you know why they use this big pot? Do you believe that it to cooks food for pigs! These boxes, which are thrown on each side, are used to collect the vegetables to bring and cook them for the pigs. And this thing that looks like a house is a pig barn!\n. For the record, the people here are good and wonderful. I love this place !\nHere I guarantee you that you can forget everything. All worries, pain. Just look at the photo and you can imagine what I say.......",
