    "description": "In wars, children suffer the most. Children and teenagers are neither on the front line of war, nor behind the scenes of war, nor the creator of it, and even if a victory is achieved, they will not benefit from it. The only achievement of war for them is mental and physical injuries.\n\n In this work of art, we see a child who is defenseless next to a ball and a wheat bush on the verge of death...\nHoping for the end of all wars.\n\n-\nJPG | 1920px X 1920px\nDigital programs: Zbrush 2021 / Blender Cycles",
