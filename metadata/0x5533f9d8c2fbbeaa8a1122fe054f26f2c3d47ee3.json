    "description": "“Smiley” Acrylic on Canvas, 90x70cm\nThis artwork touches on problems related to mental health. After the pandemic, many people become isolated from society and participate in social activities. This caused the influx of new online therapists and thanks to that, people have more access to help and support. To add further, the way people present themselves in the web/social media and what is true and lie. Many people show themselves as happy sending happy emotes but in truth more often than not this is just the facade, thus the \"our virtual personality\" in web can have multiple sides which seems to escalate emotions often not entirely positive which show the importance of how we use it.",
