    "description": "God Universe Magic (G.U.M) ft. SATE and produced by my wife and business partner SUN SUN is the last song off of my newly released 3rd studio album titled ‘Gateway Experience’.\nI wrote G.U.M as a mantra for myself to repeat to feel powerful and in control of my life, even though I’m dealing with health issues that leave me feeling powerless. Every song on this album speaks on my symptoms dealing with focal aware seizures, so I thought it was important to end it with a spell of empowerment.\nThe title of my album is an ode to the released CIA report ‘Gateway Process’ where they studied the use of sound tapes to manipulate brain waves with a goal of creating altered states. Examples include out of body experiences, remote viewing, psychic abilities, the ability to heal one's body and so much more. Join me as I question the connections with our brains, music, dreams, seizures, god and otherworldly abilities.\nG.U.M features sampled parts of an interview I did with fellow Toronto based artist SATE where I asked her about her belief in God/magic/other. And where she spoke intimately about her own mother - the late, great Salome Bey’s struggles with seizures.\nThe cover art photography, along with the eyeglasses I’m wearing was created by my wife and producer SUN SUN.",
