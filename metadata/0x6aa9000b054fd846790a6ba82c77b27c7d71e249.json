    "name": "The Train I Missed",
    "description": "There was just something about empty railway stations. I was always intrigued by the haunting silence interrupted by the sound of passing trains every now and then. \n\nAnd so, Sealdah Station, in my hometown Kolkata, had become my second home. I had my office shift ending at 12, at the midnight. After work, I would sometimes spend a couple of hours here, till the very first glimpse of the sun shows up at dawn, before going home. I would have my routine chai and charcha (tea and gossip) with Fanney Chaiwallah (Fanney, the tea-seller) and then catch a train home smoking two cigarettes on the way.\n\nThat night, however, was different. I was so taken aback by how the sun was coming out, the transition from night to that very early daybreak - missed my train right there. Instead of running to catch it, grabbed my camera and this photograph was captured at that very moment.\n\nLocation - Sealdah Station, India.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nDimensions - 3471 x 5205\n\n*The collector gets a high-resolution print!",
