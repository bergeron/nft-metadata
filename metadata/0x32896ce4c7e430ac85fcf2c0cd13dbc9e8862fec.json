    "description": "This image was created during my documentary project in Nepal in 2006 documenting various aspects of the country's socioeconomic issues in a post conflict environment. I documented the women of this Maoist cadre while visiting a Maoist camp. \n\nThis is the first image in a collection called Unraveling, which will go to support my work documenting dissent. In particular, the sales from this image will fund my coverage of the Women's March on July 9th in Washington DC in response to the recent reversal of Roe v Wade and the loss of my human rights. I can not sit by and do nothing, so I will document the unraveling of my country.\n\nImage Size 16.4M\n2942px x 1950px \n150 DPI \n19.16 x 13 inches\nShot on Illford Film using a Canon 1V ",
