    "description": "Gondolas are a species many remain unfamiliar with despite years of research, but thanks to a recent technological breakthrough they will no longer remain a mystery. There are estimated to be 10,000 Gondolas waddling aimlessly on the Ethereum blockchain. Of the 10,000 gondolas there appears to be over 200 different traits, so any you capture will be entirely unique. Gondolas are known to be solemn and melancholic, mostly staying to themselves.  However, when 100 are brought together and ritually sacrificed, their intrinsic memetic energy may be used to birth a new Gauche Gondola, embodying that their summoner desires most. Yes, if you have the desire and means to sacrifice 100 Gondolas you may, through sheer force of will, command their remains into a single new, entirely customizable form.",
