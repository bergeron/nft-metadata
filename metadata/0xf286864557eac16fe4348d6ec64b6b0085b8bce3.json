    "name": "A Blossom Transformed",
    "description": "This piece is a collaboration between illustrata and Artnaz.\n\nillustrata used Ai tools to transform Artnaz's original watercolor painting, Purple Flower, into this multidimensional abstract blossom. Purple, the inspiration for the original painting, represents royalty, power, and ambition. \n\nArtnaz is an abstract artist, painter, and photographer with over 17 years of experience. She is also a member of the International Watercolor Society. \n\nillustrata is an Ai artist creating still and animated works of art inspired by fantasy, science fiction and mental health. As an artist, she loves to push the boundaries of the rapidly evolving Ai art technologies.",
