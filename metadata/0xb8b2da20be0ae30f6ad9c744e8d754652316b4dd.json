    "description": "This is the start of our journey across EARTH, the very first piece of the one hundred NFT adventure we're about to embark on together...this, is Base Camp.\n\nThe start of our expedition finds us high above my favorite camping spot. Sleeping under the stars here feels like traveling through an extraordinary dream on an entirely different planet. To get a sense of scale in this mesmerizing landscape, you can actually find my truck if you look close enough. So, where is this incredible place? You'll have to collect the piece to find out! I will only disclose information about the location of each piece in the EARTH collection if a collector specifically requests it.\n\nAs with all of my photography NFT pieces, 50% of proceeds will be donated to charitable organizations. Base Camp, and the entire EARTH collection will benefit the World Wildlife Fund.",
