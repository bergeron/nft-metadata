Each scene's frame has mixed regularly or irregularly to create a new rhythm. Excessively zoomed screen and adjusted speed make mechanical and spasmodic movements. It also continued to delay the process of characters' actions through excessive repetition and suspension. And the glitch, which appears by making defects in video files, reveals the materiality of digital images and makes people recognize machines.",
