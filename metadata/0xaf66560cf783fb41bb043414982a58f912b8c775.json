    "description": "This is the very first NFT I've ever minted. I decided to start with a series of paint splatter images, since I've been a traditional artist for many years, and constantly have paint everywhere.\n\nThis girl was generated with AI, and then painted and corrected in Photoshop. She has the most beautiful blue eyes, and a tiny Mona Lisa smile. \n\nAs is true with all my work, this piece is bold and colorful. I have always been completely unafraid of color, and am happiest when working on pieces filled with it.",
