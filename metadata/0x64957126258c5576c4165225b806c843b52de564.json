    "description": "When someone asks you what your favorite flower is, the first bloom to pop into your head might be something classic like a rose or perhaps even an endearingly funny flower like the sunflower. Or maybe you’ve been a sucker for cheery and colorful tulips ever since you strolled through what seemed like endless rows of them at Keukenhof gardens in Holland. And those are all truly lovely choices. But when you think about the type of flower that reflects your spirit the most (no, not just your monthly birth flower), the wildflower probably comes to mind. Resilient, untamed, beautiful, surprising, colorful, unpredictable — there’s a lot to love about this particular blossom. \n\nGenerated by 345,896 lines of code",
