    "description": "'Step Out'  \nKimmeridge Bay, England\n\nArtist - Michael Hartley\n\nIn this fast-paced world, we can easily get distracted from what is good for us - or see what we might need. Even a short amount of time in nature can charge our batteries, ground us, and gently remind us of the important aspects of life. Nature is a very rewarding place, on many levels.\n\nThis piece is from one of my visits to nature, where I captured a certain stillness. I don't generally plan my photography. I like to see what beauty is there on the day. \n\n--\n\nMichael Hartley (b. 1973, Darlington, England) is a nature photographer. He processes digital captures in black and white, with a timeless, spacious aesthetic. Puncturing through modern distractions, he creates visual reminders of a healthy nature.
