    "description": "When the righteous come forth to witness a new dawn , put aside our woes and sing a new song\nThey put aside the old man and it feels less of itself , a man outgrowing his present knowledge of self\nI was the old man, I tasted water in the ocean , I found a new peace and I owned it.\nI believed every wave that I felt I knew it was my time, My time of purity, my time of rejuvenation. \nThe realm of been a spirit being was a new phase for me but still it was my time and i will explore these etherealms as they guide me to a higher self. - Dweirdo",
