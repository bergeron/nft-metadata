    "name": "Dark Ecology: Oedipal Path",
    "description": "Timothy Morton argues that ecological awareness in the present Anthropocene era takes the form of a strange loop or MÃ¶bius strip, twisted to have only one side. Deckard travels this oedipal path in Blade Runner (1982) when he learns that he might be the enemy he has been ordered to pursue. Ecological awareness takes this shape because ecological phenomena have a loop form that is also fundamental to the structure of how things are.\n\n\"Dark Ecology\" investigates the duality of human existence. Consuming to survive, survive to consume. ",
