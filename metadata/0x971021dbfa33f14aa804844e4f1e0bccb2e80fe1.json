    "description": "Often religious faith is at odds with technological advancement and attempts control over it which often leads to arrested progress.\n\nFaith Based Control was made in late 2021, inspired by the fatwas released by several prominent Indonesian religious organisations denouncing cryptocurrency as legal tender or investment asset.\n\nThis artwork was a special commission for Being ASEAN, a 2021 virtual exhibition organised by Maybank and ASEAN in conjunction with Expo Dubai 2020.",
