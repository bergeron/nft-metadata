    "description": "Happy Bicycle Day!\nThe various dark things that have happened around the world recently have made me feel hopeless and lose faith in some of my core beliefs.\nBut today I want to celebrate faith, celebrate freedom.\nBelieve what you believe and believe that there’s truth in what you believe.\nDon’t stop believing - keep your intentions strong. Where there is belief, there will be freedom.\nWe are all in this process together. ",
