    "description": "The ATF project is a study of the phenomenon of the influence of personal choice on the psyche in an oversaturated contextual environment. Discovering \nyourself in the mass and turning to one's own self.\n\nThe project will consist of many elements, the starting point of which is the live part of the performance. A meta gallery will be created for the project, where we will present all the artifacts in the form of GIF animations created using AI and canvases created from the large canvas on which the performance took place.\n\nThe reverse video is the documentation of the performance.",
