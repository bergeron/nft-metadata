    "description": "\"\nHow deep is your universe? \nI completely fell down into the grotto I made. \nEven I didn't know the depth of it. \n\"\n\nDo you remember? The first scars. The first moments of despair. \n\nIt wasn't until I faced the darkness that I began to understand myself as a human being.\n\nIt's still scary and unsettling, but with this work, I felt a sense of release and liberation, like, \"Oh, I've finally found it. My own healing.'\n\nThe work may come across as a bit dark and dank, and that's the intention, but what can I say, I'm not a very pleasant human being.\n\nIt's actually quite embarrassing to show your inner world.\n\nIt's like being naked and feeling the full weight of the world's eyes on you.\n\nIt took me a long time to grit my teeth and get started.\n\nOnce you're constantly depicting your own dark world, you're able to let go of the things you're stuck with, right?",
