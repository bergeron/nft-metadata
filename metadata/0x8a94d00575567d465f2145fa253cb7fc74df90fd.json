    "description": "I’m Glassface. I’ve been creating music my entire life. I’ve spent the past 10 years working as a music video / commercial director and visual artist, moonlighting as a producer & songwriter for other artists. In the past few years I’ve come to realize the importance of sharing my music with the world, putting my head down to finish some of the myriad of demos I have in the vault. Putting everything into the music. In the past 3 months, I’ve released 3 new songs with accompanying visuals. “There’s No Other One” is my 4th release this year, and is truly special to me. Oh, and I’m just getting started.\n\nThere’s No Other One is a mix of some of my favorite things. Produced by Matti Free and me, we brought together live guitar and drums, pitched toms, analog synths under a cutting vocal. Minimal 80’s-inspired pop rock leading into a crescendo of maximalist electronic production.\n\nNodding to favorite artists of mine including Daft Punk and Francis & The Lights - the song is an amalgamation of influences. It’s really important to me to make the music that I want to hear. Lyrically, it’s about a moment of clarity - that feeling when everything comes together and makes sense. A somber night drive of self-discovery. The electricity you feel after a life-affirming realization. Disguised as a love song, I’d say “There’s No Other One” is more of a self-love song. When I realized I was the only one who could accomplish my dreams, it empowered me, and I knew I was unstoppable. It’s about staying the course and letting that feeling be a North Star. I really believe in what I’m doing. This song is for anyone who has had that realization that they are that one.\n",
