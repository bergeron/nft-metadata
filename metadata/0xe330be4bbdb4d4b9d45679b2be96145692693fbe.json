    "description": "Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.\nI'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size\nBut when I start to tell them,\nThey think I'm telling lies.\nI say,\nIt's in the reach of my arms\nThe span of my hips,\nThe stride of my step,\nThe curl of my lips.\nI'm a woman\nPhenomenally.\nPhenomenal woman,\nThat's me.\n\nI walk into a room\nJust as cool as you please,\nAnd to a man, \nThe fellows stand or \nFall down on their knees. \nThen they swarm around me, \nA hive of honey bees. \nI say, \nIt's the fire in my eyes, \nAnd the flash of my teeth, \nThe swing in my waist, \nAnd the joy in my feet. \nI'm a woman\nPhenomenally.\nPhenomenal woman,\nThat's me.\n\nPoem by Maya Anjelou\nArt by MIAI\n\nDetail:  2867 x 4300",
