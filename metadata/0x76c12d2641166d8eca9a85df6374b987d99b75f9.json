    "description": "Yaginya is an ancient character of Slavic mythology, a young incarnation of the legendary Baba Yaga.\n\nYaginya is a conductor between the worlds. This is one of the few characters of Slavic legends who can easily move between the world of Nav, Prav, Yav and Slav.\n\nYaginya's favorite vehicle is a mortar, on which she can fly wherever she wants.\n\nOn the right side of her mortar is amaranth and secret grass as a symbol of eternal life and youth. On the left side, chamomile to attract good luck and fill with feminine power, and thyme protecting from the evil eye and damage.\n\nThe young Baba Yaga lives in a hut on chicken legs with her faithful helpers: cats, owls and crows. They run far where they want, and then tell Yaga gossip and news. \n\nBayun the cat sits on a high wooden pole and guards Yaga's tranquility. No one can come to her house alive without her permission.",
