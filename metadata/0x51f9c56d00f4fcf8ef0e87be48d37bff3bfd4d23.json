    "description": "'Snow Crash Sword One' is a 1/1 NFT that contains the digital twin of the Snow Crash Sword One - Hand-Forged Tachi. This NFT is a collaboration between master sword-makers Wētā Workshop and Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson The Tachi sword is inspired by and in reference to the Tsuji family, whose story —written by Stephenson beginning in 2014, but never before revealed to the public —forms part of the Extended Snow Crash Universe Timeline. The Tsuji family are the original owners of Hiro’s sword. They forge a close relationship with Hiro Protagonist before the events of the novel and are among the first investors in the Metaverse. To commemorate their investment, and as a token of friendship, Hiro works with the fictitious “Meta Workshop” to create the tachi and present it to Hatsuo Tsuji, the patriarch of the family. The digital twin of the Tachi not only identically captures every detail of the physical sword, it also showcases the beauty of the sword's materials and craftsmanship in a virtual environment. The Snow Crash Sword One and its Digital Twin represent a symbol of humanity standing at the edge of a new epoch, as humankind continues to explore the digital frontiers of the future.",
