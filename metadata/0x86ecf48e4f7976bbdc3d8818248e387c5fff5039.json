    "description": "This is the first painting from the future collection of 10 pictures, dedicated to nature.\n\nThis is my own work, in which I depicted a fragment of nature that I saw many years ago, and tried to reproduce it using 3D graphics.\n\nThe essence of the whole scene, we seem to be in a museum, at an exhibition of pictures, and at some point there is an opportunity to look inside the scene depicted on the canvas.\n\nI wish you a pleasant journey!\n\np.s. with the purchase of each nft of this collection, as a gift, I will also send a static image of the painting in tif format",
