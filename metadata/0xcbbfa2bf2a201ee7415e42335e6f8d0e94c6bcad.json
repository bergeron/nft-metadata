    "description": "350 pieces of individual artworks that will entitle you to full access of the ecosystem - 序数三角形市場\n\nOnce the Ordinals infrastructure becomes easily accessible and user-friendly, you will have the opportunity to swap your ETH token for a BTC Ordinal, unlocking access to this extraordinary NFT experience.\n\nEach piece of the collection will be securely imprinted on the indestructible Bitcoin blockchain, with the imprint order determined by your token ID.\n\nCreating layers of triangles on a canvas involves using inventive brush strokes to achieve a unique and striking visual effect. This technique typically involves applying layers of paint in triangular shapes to create a geometric pattern on the canvas. The brush strokes are carefully placed to create a sense of movement and depth within the artwork, as each layer of triangles builds upon the previous one. The result is a complex and dynamic composition that draws the viewer's eye and provides a sense of depth and dimensionality to the piece. This technique requires skill and precision to execute successfully, as the artist must balance the size and shape of the triangles, the color choices, and the placement of each brush stroke to create a harmonious and visually appealing whole.\n\nx/350\ncc0",
