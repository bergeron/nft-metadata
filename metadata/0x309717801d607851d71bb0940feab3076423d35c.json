    "description": "We are rising! A thought of anger pollutes the day. From that moment on, we feel, we design, we reason. Laugh or cry, embrace the pain, set aside worries. Whether it's joy or sadness, freedom is still the only way to go. A person's yesterday may not be like his tomorrow, and remember! Nothing can just stay that way.",
