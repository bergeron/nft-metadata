    "description": "We travel because we need to, because distance and difference are the secret of creativity. When we get home, home is still the same. But something in our mind has been changed, and that changes everything. When we escape from that place we spend most of our time, the mind is suddenly made aware of all those errant ideas we'd previously suppressed. We start thinking about obscure possibilities that never would have occurred to us if we'd stayed home. \n- Johnah Lehrer",
