    "description": "[01/86] - Life, Death and Resurrection - The Celebration\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nGPS: 47.096281, 37.547407\n\nDate: 08/09/2007 \n\nStory\n\nThe celebration of the Day of the City of Mariupol photographed at the most popular place - Drama Theatre Square. Every year the festival and parade took place here and as I remember it was my favorite day in a year for many years in a row. I used to rollerblade on the square or Dram as we called it since I was 8. This place was my \"temple\" for a long time while all of my friends gathered here and I've spent thousands of hours somewhere around the theatre building during period of my life from 8 to 18 years. \n\nOn the 16th of March 2022 russian air forces dropped a massive bomb on the building where more than 1000 of civilians were hiding. The whole World have seen the aerial image of destroyed theatre building with a huge writing \"ДЕТИ\" (\"children\" in russian language). More than 600 of people including children and pregnant women were killed. The exact number of cacualties is still unknown while russian occupants did their best to hide the evidence...  \n \nPlease read the investigation of this tragedy written by Amnesty International: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/06/ukraine-deadly-mariupol-theatre-strike-a-clear-war-crime-by-russian-forces-new-investigation/\n\nI have a plan to visit this place and retake every one of the 86 photographs from this collection to show the world how the war had changed a peaceful city. The next step will be to reshoot them again when Ukraine rebuilds every single place from this list. This is a long term project that might take decades to complete. This is the first photograph in the colletion that was taken 15 years ago in 2007. At 35 y.o. now I feel like I have enough time and I will have a chance to reach my goal during my lifetime.  Wish me luck.",
