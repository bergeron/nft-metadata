    "description": "‘Silvery River’ is a CGI video work that draws on experiences of breastfeeding via an anatomical image that went viral in 2019.\n\nThe piece begins with a flower oozing a kind of liquid gold that references colostrum, the first, nutrient rich milk. Dense and full of white blood cells that produce antibodies, it fills baby’s cherry sized tummy before the milk ‘comes in’ proper. 'Silvery River' tracks this process with the plant over producing and almost drowning in liquid before settling down to a more rhythmic and regulated flow.\n\nTo view licence terms and further info please see:\n\nhttps://www.janehayesgreenwood.com/nft",
