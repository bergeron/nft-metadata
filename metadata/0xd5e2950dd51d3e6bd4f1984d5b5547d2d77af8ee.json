It may not be grand  \nBut taking out the trash has helped me take a stand\n\nDo not underestimate the power of a simple task  \nIt is the smallest of things that can make the biggest impact  \nI am grateful for this job, it has given me a chance  \nTo find happiness and finally take a stance\n\n_________________________________\n\nDay #1 of a new journey.  The first tub filled with trash.  The first day on the job.  Some of my own garbage, from within, seems to have been tossed into the dumpsters that day as well.",
