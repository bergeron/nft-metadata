    "description": "The unseen light of the Native Navajo Sandstone of Monument Valley. This location has always held a special spiritual place in my heart. When I started shooting Infrared in 2021, I had Monument Valley high on my list of places that I wanted to shoot in Infrared. As I arrived early morning blue hour, before the sun rose, I witnessed the most amazing color degradation in the sky and the sandstone lit up with soft pink and purple hues in my viewfinder. \n\nInfrared, or “IR” photography, offers photographers of all abilities and budgets the opportunity to explore a new world – the world of the unseen. Why “unseen”? Because our eyes literally cannot see IR light, as it lies just beyond what is classified as the “visible” spectrum – that which human eyesight can detect.\n\nThe colors captured here are truly as what the Infrared light spectrum produced at that morning blue hour moment, the sun and stars were added in post processing.
