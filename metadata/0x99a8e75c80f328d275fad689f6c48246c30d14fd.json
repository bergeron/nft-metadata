    "name": "Bridge of Sighs",
    "description": "'Ponte Dei Sospiri' or 'Bridge of Sighs' is an enclosed limestone bridge that connects the inquisitor's office in the Doge's palace to the 'New prison'. The myth that envelops the bridge is the fact that the name evolved from the heavy sighs of condemned convicts who, crossing the bridge to go to prison, knew they were probably  catching the sight of Venice for the last time.\n\nIn reality, among the plethora of landmarks to be crossed out of the Venice itinerary, after much desperation of vacillating through the Bridge of Puglia seeking to find the Bridge of Sighs, the vision caught me off-guard when I decided to look away from the revolving blue dot on the screen to finally catch the glimpse of the ever so beautiful limestone bridge which in fact had me give out a heavy sigh of relief.\n\nThe flamboyant colors depict hopefulness in finding the much coveted things in life if one stays indomitable throughout.\n\nDetails: Free hand pigment marker sketch on A3 rotring sheet.\n",
