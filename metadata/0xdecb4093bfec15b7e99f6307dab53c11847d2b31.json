    "name": "ROAR Monsta",
    "description": "A mythical or fictional creature that roars, but in a way that is not intended to be frightening. This type of monster could have a cute or playful appearance, with features such as a friendly face, soft fur, or whimsical accessories. Its roar might be more of a cheerful chirp, growl, or giggle, and its behavior could be described as playful or mischievous. This type of roar monster would be ideal for a children's story or video game, as it would be approachable and non-threatening, while still retaining the excitement and energy associated with a creature that roars. The design and personality of a not-scary roar monster could vary widely depending on the creator's vision, but its overarching goal would be to evoke a sense of fun and adventure, rather than fear.",
