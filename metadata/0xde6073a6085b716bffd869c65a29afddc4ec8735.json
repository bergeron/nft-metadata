    "description": "This is the first of a planned series of illustrations on the theme of \"the way of a new reality.\"\nThe digital world allows the artist to embody any fantasies, create interactive, go beyond the physical picture. But without vr glasses this world is invisible.\nMy illustrations are about dissonance, about a transitional moment, about the junction of technologies.\nHere, flat people roam the flat world in virtual glasses and draw augmented reality for themselves using neurographics. Neurography is also a new art form at the intersection with psychology. But neurographics is 2d, it is drawn with markers on paper. This is the essence and irony of my art. This is the subtle world of digital reality.\nI called this collection \"Neurovirtual way of the Art\".",
