    "description": "“I’m Peyton Riker. I’m 25 years old and my relationship with my body has definitely been a journey. Growing up I definitely felt pressured by not only the people that I surrounded myself with, but even sometimes my personal family. \n\nAnd doing this portrait series has really allowed me to do something for me.  This journey of loving my body has definitely been hard and challenging at times but overcoming something and finally being able to be comfortable in my skin is something that’s so important. It’s something that I hope everyone can strive to get to through whatever that means to you; Getting out and going on a walk, yoga, meditating. Doing something that makes you and your body happy. \n\nBeing where I am today, even tho I might not look the same that I used to, I’m so much happier and healthier. Not only physically but mentally and emotionally as well. It’s definitely been a process. \n\n“What is the hardest thing that you’ve had to accept about existing in your body?”\n\nI feel like I might not have my ideal body like I said that I’d want when I was younger, but I’m so happy with where I am now and I don’t have the pressures that I used to have of constantly weighing myself or restricting my eating or anything like that. At the time I thought that I loved how I looked but I didn’t really love who I am. And I think that’s a tough aspect. \n------------------  \nTitle: Bodies # 1.
