    "description": "Love is a disease. It's a distraction. It will tear us apart, this love - it will come from nowhere, it will leave into the void. You'll be alone. You'll feel like you've been pulled apart at the seams, when you walk down the river and see the faces show you who you are and who you are not. Joan, can you hear the bells ringing after your name, when lovers in the junk call you up?"
