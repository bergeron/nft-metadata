    "description": "This work depicts what is in my mind, unlimited thoughts, sometimes these thoughts also become a dead end in the creation of works of art, because too many ideas or ideas/inspirations make me 'choke' when I put them on paper. This work was created spontaneously just before dealing with paper media, dreamy thoughts that led to the creation of a figure, one of which was my mind, as well as the surrounding circumstances that appeared in my mind while working.\n\nDrawing on Paper\nPencil Color\nDimensions: 3263 x 3263\n2022",
