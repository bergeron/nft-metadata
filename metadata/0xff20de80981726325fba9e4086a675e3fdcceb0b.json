    "description": "Road Poems is a series of images depicting moody one-liners spelled out on road-side signs. â€¨\n\nAn eerie processing style, matched with the compositing of these short, emotive messages yields work with a goal of evoking a feeling within the viewer - sometimes a connection with a memory or a dream, and in other cases, to a fear.  Each image explores a concept inspired by a personal experience, or a witnessed experience, in my life. \n\n1/1 NFT series by Austin Visual.\t\t",
