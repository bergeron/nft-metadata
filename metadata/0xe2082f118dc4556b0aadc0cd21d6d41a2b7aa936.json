Nobody got life figured out. we all just making it up as we go.  \n2. Don’t take your relationships for granted. Be sure to capture a memory with every loved one. \n3. Depend on yourself always. Look inward to find ways to become better.\n\nCredits:\n\nitsalwaysyourfault  \n\tDanny Watts  \n\tdav\n\nasongimadeaftermypops  \n\tDanny Watts  \n\tdav  \n\t48th St  \n\tEPT\n\nasongimadeoutofenvy  \n\tDanny Watts  \n\tJohn Leonard",
