    "description": "for an experiment to draw a conclusion, it must first come to an end.\n\nconvergence is the culmination of nearly a year of work on divergence and the divergence brand.\nrunning a brand, especially alone, and even without promises, is a difficult task.\nthe divergence brand simply didn't need to grow after the initial release, and it was my art that was pushing it forward at all.\nin the meantime, it ran antithetical to its own thesis, removing the humanity of the human behind it.\n\nconvergence was released in a one-of-a-kind attention auction.\neach piece cost just .01eth to mint and was available until 24 hours passed without any mints.\nat the end of the auction, the companion physical piece \"to be continued\" was given to the final minter.",
