    "description": "Since purchasing my first camera, Iâ€™ve had my fair share of revelatory experiences. Of them, one of the most notable was my first day in northern Norway in 2019.  \n \nIt was mid February when we landed in the small town of Narvik in the middle of the night, then caught a shuttle to our rental car and promptly began our journey to the small fishing village of Reine, located on the southern tip of the Lofoten Archipeligo. \n \nThe first four hours of driving was spent white-knuckling the steering wheel though a full-on whiteout with extreme winds. It was only when we reached the final stretch that the clouds began to part. Peak after snowy peak began to appear all around us. Then the ocean. Finally, light peered through the storm to illuminate one of the most beautiful places I have seen in my life. We made it to Reine with just enough time to catch the fading light of sunset, and began our month long stay in one of the most strikingly beautiful places on the planet.",
