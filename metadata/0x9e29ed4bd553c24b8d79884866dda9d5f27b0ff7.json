Well, we assume this one is one of the pair. But it looks...hurt. Dishevelled. And its mannerisms are those of fear & worry; it's lower body almost melting. It has become scratched & damaged, but it does not act as if it is in pain. Its words echo in our minds, without it even speaking. Where it once only said \"CUBE\" it now says \"help...you\" over & over.\n\nIs it a warning? Have they come to help us? And who had the cruel idea to put this scared being into a filthy cell with xenophobic graffiti? We will get this one a new, cleaner cell. We will help it get warm & recover, for we do not believe it means us harm. But what DOES it want? Why are they here?\n\nWe shall continue to search for answers...",
