    "description": "Fractionalized ownership over the ancient gold mask means you own a fraction of the real artifact. This is the first time in history such a piece has been purchasable as the other 3 are in Museums. There are only 200 Tier 1 “The Guardian” spots available for ownership.\n\nThe Guardians is the rarest of NFT tiers and will be most desirable by established collectors. Each of The Guardians NFTs are numbered out of 200.\n\nAlong with the F-NFT piece, you will also receive a digital collectible in the form of a Metaverse Wearable Gold Mask. This is a scarce digital artifact and identifies you as part of the society while providing access to 4 unique Metaverse spaces.\n\nWe truly believe that we are able to offer one of the most exemplary wearable in the Metaverse since the item can continuously represent the value, distribute wealth, and offer visual representation and feedback of the digital, visual and psychological point of view.",
