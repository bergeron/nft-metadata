    "description": "I was 15 in 1967 boating on Lake Michigan when I noticed what seemed to be ruins of an ancient temple on the bluffs. Fascinated, I swam ashore. \n\nIt was the remains of legendary Villa Turicum, the opulent 1912 estate of Harold McCormick, son of inventor Cyrus McCormick, and Edith Rockefeller, richest woman in America, daughter of John D Rockefeller. Designed by architect Charles Platt, its Italianate gardens were judged finest in America, with ornate carvings, cascading fountains, grand stairs and tranquil Tea House. \n\nBut Edith, burdened by unhappiness, scarcely spent a night there. The couple divorced and Edith received the Villa. Tragically, Edith's lavish spending and extensive philanthropy left her penniless when she died. The grand Villa fell into ruins. \n\nIn 1974 I took the last large format images before the site was bulldozed. I wanted Villa Turicum to be remembered, even in ruins, as a place of beauty and enchantment.\n\nInfo at https://www.mlbrubaker.com/p/about-villa-turicum\n",
