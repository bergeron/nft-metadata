    "description": "I wanted to create \"Mirror #1\"Â to be a one-of-a-kind and thought-provoking artwork that inspires viewers to go on a self-discovery trip. I created a visually appealing work that transcends place and time by mixing the spontaneity of watercolor with the accuracy of digital photo editing.\n\nThe Rorschach test, which I used as a metaphor for one's authentic, naked self, was the source of inspiration for the central motif in \"Mirror #1.\"\n Viewers are driven to explore the complexity of their own personal histories and identities by this abstract, symmetrical inkblot-like image, which recalls the idea of a mirror reflecting our core selves.\n\nI could express myself freely and artistically by using traditional watercolor techniques on paper to produce this piece. \nMy intention with \"Mirror #1\" was to challenge viewers to confront their own perceptions of self and identity while reflecting on the various versions of themselves that have existed throughout their lives.\n\n\n",
