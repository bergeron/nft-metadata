    "description": "This work is based on a wooden path as a canvas.\n\nThe random placement of the rope to tie the yacht is a great accent.\n\nThis photo also shows the beauty of the tent camera.\n\nThe landscape, the ground and the rope all become the main focus of the photograph. I don't even know which one to focus on.\n\nThe machine you can see in the picture is the one that brings the yacht down from the land to the sea. It was a beautiful day and the sky was blue on the wooden path.",
