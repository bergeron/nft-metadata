    "description": "Mercy is a virtue of the heart, the strength to feel what another feels. It’s the generosity to give more than one has, and it’s the humility to receive with gratitude.\n\nMercy is not a passive act. Mercy is never satisfied with mere words or thoughts. Mercy takes action and meets need with practical help. Mercy is a force for good in this world, and we would all do well to cultivate it in our lives.",
