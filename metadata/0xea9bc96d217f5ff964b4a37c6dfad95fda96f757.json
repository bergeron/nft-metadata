    "description": "How this project came to life - I produced and made the song for my album towards the end of 2021. I was going through a bit of a rough patch mentally and physically at the time mainly due to stress and pressure put on myself to finish the album so a natural flow of aggression wanted to present itself and i think it did in a cool way. It turned out to be one of my favorite tracks i had made and was really moved by the gritty but soulful texture that came out with the final mix. Once the song was done and album was set to release i was ready to start planning the video. I linked up with my guy Ethan May who helped with camera and some DP and my other main photo/video ace Hydreams for the editing once we had the vision set. Beyond hyped that Glass will be the official home in Web3 for this piece of art. \n\n ",
