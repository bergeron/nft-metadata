    "description": "There are many people whose fate is far worse than just an outlet of emotion. When they hold back emotions for too long, they simply die inside forever, unable to return, and nothing remains but an endless emptiness inside a person, and this emptiness begins to irrevocably destroy the remaining shell. A sense of indifference to everything that surrounds you emerges! Infinite emptiness.",
