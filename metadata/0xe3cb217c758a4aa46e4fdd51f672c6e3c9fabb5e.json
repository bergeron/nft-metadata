    "description": "Produced and Written by edwin :)\n\nThis song was written at a time when I thought I was going to lose the love of my life. Fighting for love isn't always easy but it sure as hell is worth it. You can't let previous baggage affect your current situation, all you can do is learn from it and be better next time. \n\nThis song is for everyone fighting for love!",
