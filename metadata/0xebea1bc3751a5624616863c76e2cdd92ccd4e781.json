    "description": "This is an individual art work produced specially for Matt (aka The Shdw) for his constant appreciation for the work and his exploration and research into how it is made. \n\nThe Photon Net is a piece made using customised light filters and also strands of hair photographed through paper and later altered in Procreate to function as part of the paint function using a special process created by the artist.\n\nPhoton Nets, in the artist's imagination, are ways to trap individual light molecules, or photons, for examination. It is the artist's belief that light is a lot like a mushroom colony or a piece of fabric. Light made seem to appear individually in a moment of specific time. But is always there, always infinite molecules acting as one. The Photon Net allows you to contemplate its existence and form.",
