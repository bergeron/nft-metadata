    "description": "Live the full experience on [“The Hero’s Journey” collection’s website](https://nft.matiasmarano.com/theherosjourney).\n\n*A deep chasm opened in the Roman Forum, the seers declared that the pit would never close until Rome's most valuable possession was thrown into it; claiming that nothing was more precious than a brave young citizen, Marcus Curtius leaped, into the chasm, which immediately closed.*\n\nThe starting point is “the call to adventure”. An unexpected event announces that it's time to go beyond old concepts, ideals and emotional patterns.\nIf we reject it, the events will continue and we will be forced to leave behind the ordinary reality.\nThe first encounter is a figure who provides us protective amulets against the dragon’s forces we will have to face. It symbolizes the assistance that life gives to who answer the call. We just have to trust.\n\n**The adventure of our lives is always taking a step beyond the known to enter the unknown.**\n\n3200x4517 px\n300 dpi",
