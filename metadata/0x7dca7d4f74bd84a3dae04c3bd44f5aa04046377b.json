    "description": "Waves represents the vulnerability and fragility of \nhuman beings in the face of death. \nItâ€™s a reflection on how to confront the void it leaves behind. \nIt speaks of a feeling of emptiness, discomfort, \nand rumination on the past. \nIt speaks of grieving after the loss of a loved one. \nMemories flood our minds and every element of \ndaily life becomes a hook to think about the lost soul. \nThis increases sadness, melancholy, and anger. \nSometimes the pain stops but then returns like waves of the sea. \nThe protagonist feels like a wreckage: \nhe feels broken, without a goal and stranded in his pain. \nWe cannot escape the ghost that lives in our mind. \nWe must accept the fate of our life, celebrating it in all its forms.",
