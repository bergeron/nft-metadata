    "description": "artist hana is an English painter and chemist. She invented a new sustainable artist medium, Placrylic, and utilises the old African and Italian Sgraffito technique, which consists of putting down a preliminary surface, covering it with another, and then scratching the superficial layer in such a way that the lines created reveal parts of the underlying layer; each painting she creates informs the texture of new formulations of marine safe paints that can be used by artists",
