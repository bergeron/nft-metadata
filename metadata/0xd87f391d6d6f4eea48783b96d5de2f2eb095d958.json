    "description": "Distress is a powerful force that can engulf us in despair, hopelessness and darkness of the mind. \n\nThis piece was inspired by my experience and time living in the Republic of the Marshall Islands as well as the story of a man named Jonah, who was swallowed by a fish and survived for three days in the belly of the beast.\n\n“In My Distress,” is Mask #0219 in my personal project titled The Mask Collective, and it is the first one minted on my own (and first-ever deployed) smart contract.",
