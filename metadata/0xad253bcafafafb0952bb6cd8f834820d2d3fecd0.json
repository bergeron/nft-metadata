And ran into it to the sound of deaf explosions.\n ⠀⠀\n On February 24, at 5:00 am, Russia attacked Ukraine when everyone was asleep.\n\n It hurts me that political issues are resolved in such a way.\n ⠀\n People are not to blame for anything!\n I AM AGAINST ANY WAR.\n\nmoney from the sale = help and support for victims in Ukraine",
