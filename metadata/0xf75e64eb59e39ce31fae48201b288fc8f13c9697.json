    "description": "\"Tarkwa Above: Lost City\"\n3840Ã—2160\n\nThe once beautiful beaches of Tarkwa Bay are now a desolate wasteland, with the ocean churning with toxic pollution. In this photograph, we see a lone city building their way through the ruins, the water people discovered new tech to purify and store water. Despite the grimness of the surroundings, there is a glint of hope, a determination to survive and rebuild in this post-apocalyptic world.\n\nMade with Blender + Adobe Photoshop\n\nNovember, 2022\nLagos, Nigeria",
