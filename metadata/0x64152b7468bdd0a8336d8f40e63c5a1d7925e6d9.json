    "description": "Studying the theme of mortality and the fragility of the human body. The paintings in the background featuring sculptures of human organs reinforce this theme, emphasizing the ephemeral nature of the physical form.\n\nI hope to evoke a sense of the echoes of time that shape our existence. Using impasto and paint textures, I weave allegory and symbolism in and out of reality to bring the theme to a high note. \n\n___\nCreated in 3D, digital painting. Deconstructed in Stable Diffusion."
