    "description": "This work is inspired by Hilma af Klint's \"The Ten Largest, No. 7, Adulthood, Group IV\" created in 1907. The makeup here functions as an illusion where precise lines cut across the features of the face to imitate a 2-dimensional painting.\n\nFace Cards is a collection of 24 hand painted makeup art self portraits by Laurel Charleston, released as collectible editions on the ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe 200 editions live on a custom ERC-1155 smart contract owned and operated by Laurel. \n\nThe makeup looks in this collection continue to redefined the beauty industry, pushing the limits of what makeup can achieve.",
