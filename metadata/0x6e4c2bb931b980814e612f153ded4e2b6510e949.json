    "description": "Identity theft began in the Garden of Eden.\n\nSatan declares war on our identity because he knows it is perhaps the surest way to wreck the relationship between us and our God. Satan refused to accept his God-given identity and instead sought to form a new identity apart from God.\n\nAs a Christian, you must base your identity upon two things, perhaps the most important things: who God really is and who God says you really are.\n\nSo when you ask him who am I? He responds with:\n\nBut you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, Godâ€™s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. - 1 Peter 2:9",
