    "description": "My collection is about Pink Floyd band. Album “wish you were here”. It has 5 songs that are as follows. The first NFT is about the first song of album ,”shine on you crazy diamond part1”. Here the diamond and the guitar symbolize the leader of the group, Syd barrett, who is the symbol of love and awareness. The dragon and the darkness symbolize the capitalist system that encompasses everything and the wall created by the capitalist system to isolate man. The tree is a symbol of man and society that is being destroyed by the capitalist system. But the diamond has overcome the darkness and reached the truth with the light it has received from its consciousness.\nRead my roadmap on twitter “@kian gallery”",
