    "description": "You will often find Numpty hanging with his brother, of a similar name, on a wall. One particular day he discovered fire. Curiosity killed the cat, but Numpty doesn't like cats, so he thought this must be a good thing. Needless to say the matches were lit and landed square on Numpty's head. He now does public speaking for baldness.\n\n\n\nIf you own any CLASSIC BEANS from the 'CLASSIC BEANS - Dumb Ways to Die' collection, please read the terms and conditions: https://www.beansnfts.io/terms/",
