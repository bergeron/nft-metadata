    "description": "\nSeeming like it is swimming freely, actually, the whale is imprisoned in an aquarium suffocating and suffering. The whale is shouting for help. \n\nIt is a metaphor for the country society meaning that people look like living happily in a democratic country.\n\nHowever, they are stuck in an unjust and unequal system suffering to survive. \n\nThis art is created using programs such as Photoshop, After Effects, and Premiere Pro.\n\n#DigitalArt #3Dart #whale #3D #PS #AfterEffects #PremierePro",
