    "description": "It was late out, the streets buzzing with energy as a sea of umbrellas and masked faces moved around me. A flicker of a gloved hand instantly drew me in. As if to cast a spell on me. The winter air seemed warmer, and the lights brighter as if each sequin had reignited a childlike sense of magic. My eyes glided over strangers, joyfully following the dance of his hand until it faded away.  \n\n---  \n\nWe all have our own journeys, and with that, our own stories, the ones we wrote ourselves, the ones others have written about us, and the remnants of those passed down to us by others. These stories and moments shape us, and they leave traces of themselves behind as they silently whisper their secrets into the world.  \n\nThrough the power of the blockchain and my Hidden Stories contract, we created a beautiful convergence of my photography and my fascination with hidden stories, allowing collectors to leave their traces behind by adding their own hidden story to each HS NFT they own.  \n\nThese stories will be cemented onto the blockchain, with another story being added every time they pass hands, connecting us all.",
