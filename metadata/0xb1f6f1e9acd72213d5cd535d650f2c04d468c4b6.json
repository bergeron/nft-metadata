    "name": "Flawless victory",
    "description": "The triumph feels faultless, as if there were no obstacles. When making judgments, he is stoic and expresses his resolve solely via the power of his presence.\n\nThe divinities are emotionless; instead, they simply act in accordance with their intuition, which serves as a mirror for the future as it is perceived in the present.\n\nThe person who is overcome by emotions becomes a slave to them, repeats his error, and prevents the grandeur that is inside us from flowing.\n\nThe mind rules the emotions, and the soul is always fighting to be seen. This fight is silent and internal, but it is no less brutal because it is always won by the same person.",
