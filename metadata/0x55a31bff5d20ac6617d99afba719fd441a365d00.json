    "description": "A long time ago was Hina, a very courageous and hard working goddess, but with a rather tumultuous temper. \n\nHer father was Mahana, the Sun, and her mother was Marama, the Moon. \n\nShe happened to disturb the creator of all the gods, Ta'aroa, so much that she was sent  back to her mother, tasked with protecting Mankind as a punishment.\n\nShe carried out her mission conscientiously, centuries after centuries. \n\nAs memories became dreams,  as dreams became legends and myths,  Hina seems to have merged with her mother, Marama, into a single deity. \n\nShe continues to inspire fascination and admiration.  \n\nIn many civilizations, the moon has been adored as a symbol of fertility, and is still adored to this day, combining mysteries, fears and passions.",
