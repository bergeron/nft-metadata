    "description": "The Ballon d'Or® is the most important trophy in football, but do you really know its history? Inspired by a round, gold-set comet that fell to earth 66 years ago, this iconic trophy has been awarded to the world's best players ever since. But the trophy itself is destined to remain the exceptional piece we know, it is the base that interests us. More precisely, the pyrite, the stone that makes up its base.",
