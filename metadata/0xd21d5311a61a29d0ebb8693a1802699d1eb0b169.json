    "name": "RAY OF WONDER",
    "description": "There is nothing like a stingray dancing through the ocean sunbeams.\n\nTaken off the magical island of The Seychelles, this beauty captured my attention through the lens of my drone.\n\nIf you know me, I am obsessed with wildlife living in the ocean.\n\nThis image is where my passion for the ocean and it’s creatures all begun.\n\nThe moment I laid my eyes on this electric stingray, I felt an overwhelming feeling of love and understanding. \n\nI had to learn from the movement of the waves and focused on getting the perfect piece to make sure I captured this “Ray Of Wonder” in it’s purest form.\n\nI hope this special piece finds a home to someone who loves the ocean and it’s life just as much as I do.\n\nThe winning bid will receive a 18\"x24\" inch fine art print.",
