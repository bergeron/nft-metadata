    "description": "Yes we missed on Goblins, we missed on  Apes, couldn't afford Moonbirds nor Otherdeeds.. we bought into rug pulls and scams and watched our wallets go to 0 within hours. We got hacked, we live in Fomo, we live on constant stress, anger, deception and all kind of mental unhealthy situations. We  acknowledge the common pain and frustration with ya'll; let's at least have fun and deal with it on a sarcastic, funny and crazy way. We are here for you and we know how it is like! Let's Survive this and the upcoming Bear Markets together while we make it through this amazing NFT experience. Welcome Bear Market Survivors!",
