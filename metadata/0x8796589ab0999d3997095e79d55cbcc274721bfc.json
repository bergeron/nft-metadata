    "description": "\"Once upon a time, I, Zhuangzi, dreamt I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Zhuangzi. Soon I awakened, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man. Between a man and a butterfly there is necessarily a distinction. The transition is called the transformation of material things.\"\nZhuangzi (Chuang-tzu) (369 BCE to 286 BCE)\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus.\n\nAI + Digital Painting by Rocketgirl\n@rocketgirl\n\n",
