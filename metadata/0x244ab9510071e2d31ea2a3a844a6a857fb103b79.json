    "description": "It has always been a pleasure for me to take pictures of fishermen in the places I have visited. Different fishing techniques of each region have always been interesting to me. The photo was taken at the Riverside in Yangshuo. Their old stories are really fascinating. After the cormorants dive into the shoals of fish, they are pulled up by the fisherman by pulling the rope around his neck. The fish caught by the cormorant are taken by the fisherman. This hunting job, which was done with very primitive methods, was really interesting for me. In the past, all fishermen used to feed their families by fishing in this way. Today, this method is used by very few fishermen. This photo we took at sunrise has been one of the unforgettable moments for me and is among the memories I have accumulated.\nDimensions: 4979 Ã—3320-14,2 mb \nResolution: 300dpi\nLocation: China\nDate: 24/10/2017\nEdition: 1/1\n",
