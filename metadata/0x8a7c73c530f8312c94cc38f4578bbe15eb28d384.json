    "description": "GM GM 🫡  \nவணக்கம் 🙏🏼\n\n01 DEC 2022\n\nI visualized this based on a shape I saw in an interesting QQL (by Tyler Hobbs) I generated few months ago.\n\nWas just a fun meme sketch I used to say GM & had no idea of minting it.\n\nBut then I thought it would be nice if more people can own this.\n\nnow sharing it with you all for free, as saying GM and GM memes/arts are one of the things that are keeping our hopes up in these tough times. \n\nFOR THE CULTURE!  \nFOR THE LOVE OF PEPE!\n\nThank You 🙏🏼  \nVALIPOKKANN 🫶🏾🫂\n\nநன்றி 🙏🏼  \nவழிப்போக்கன்  🫶🏾🫂\n\nLicense: CC0",
