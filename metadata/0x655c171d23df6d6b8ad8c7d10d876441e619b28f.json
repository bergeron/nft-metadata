    "description": "The space between something & nothing.\n\nTunnel Vision is a body of work shot on film which embodies power, mystery and melancholy. I want these images to create a sense of depth between the viewer and the frame, drawing your eyes inward and making you question what lies beyond.\n\nThe initial buyer of the piece will receive a physical print.\n\nHigh Resolution Image is 3479 × 4217 pixels.",
