    "description": "Love should be available for everyone. Love should be possible for everyone. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 71 countries criminalise same-sex relationships, in at least 6 of them the death penalty is allowed. It is shocking to me that people are condemned for the fact they want to love and be loved. To be accepted for who they are. \n\nWith this work I tried to express the idea that love is freedom and thus everyone should have the freedom to love. May we look at each other with more empathy and realise that we are all the same. That we feel the same. Cry the same. Breathe the same. We were put on this world to enjoy it and connect with one another as one. It is time to say goodbye to these rules, beliefs and thoughts that separate us and become one. \n\nLove is the key to everything. \nLet love be free...\n\n--\n\nModels: Florian Hencher & Adam Lee Mroz",
