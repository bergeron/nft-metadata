    "description": "Meefun is a 5 years old girl. She worked on this piece of art for about 4.5 months. This artwork was truly filled with her effort, concentration, creativity, and imagination. It's about monsters from her imagination. She loves to draw monsters and coloring with colorful style.\n\nFor this artwork, we let Meefun lead every step of the way. We are not pressuring her to work on it or to complete it. She has a full control on when and for how long she wants to draw. We believe we can't rush creativity. The free-flow imagination will bring art to life.\n\nDuring the journey, she didn't work only on this artwork. She created art and craft everyday. Each day she planned what she wants to do by herself.\n\nIf you're interested to see more of Meefun's work or see the day by day progress of this artwork, visit her twitter and instagram @iammeefun\n\nOriginal Paper size :  55.5 x 37.5 cm.\nImage size : 3693 x 2504 pixels\n\nStart date : 09/10/21\nCompletion date : 22/02/2022",
