    "description": "I took this portrait of Cory in his Miami studio during Art Basel of 2022. In this moment we wanted to capture the essence of where he had come from, what cosmic principles he had embraced, and we looked forward to the spectrally dazzling work he had on the horizon.\n\nIn my work, I wish to embrace and amplify the energy and power of those I'm blessed to shoot with.\n\nShot on a Hasselblad X1d 50c and 45mm f4 lens",
