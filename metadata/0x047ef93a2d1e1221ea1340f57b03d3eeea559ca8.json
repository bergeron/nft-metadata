    "description": "The journey of life is full of struggle. We try our best to overcome the struggle and lead our life. However there are moments where we just let go, we stop struggling, we stop fighting, we succumb to the pressure. \nThis is an artwork that depicts that sense of fear of a person, who is restrained by his doubts, his fear, his debts and a Black Door. \nThe Black Door with a White Handle, which symbolizes hope. All we have to do is run to it, its not easy, but we can, we do not know what lies behind it, however we have hope, we have strength that we acquired from our past. \nEmbrace the Black Door while you can.
