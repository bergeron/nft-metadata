    "description": "Our body is the only thing we carry through our lives. Whether we’re crying in a cot, or rushing through the streets to get to school in time, or making love, or waiting for a late night plane in the airport, or lying on our deathbed - our body is always there. However, sometimes we feel we don’t fully posses it, it doesn’t always behave like we want it to. \n\nIt’s because our body expresses the universal order. In ancient Greece the individuality of the body was not as simply the desire of the individual to stand out from the background of others, as it is manifested in modern times, but as an opportunity to reorganize: the body is capable of change.\n\nOur body is our soul. We have to take care of both.\n\n2848x3988 JPG ",
