    "description": "MELVV steps into lead vocals on \"I'll Be There for You\" for the first time in his career. Drawing mainly upon inspiration from Porter Robinson and Madeon, the track features sparkling arpeggios, a lush vocoder, and smashed drums; an introspective and emotional anthem with ear-worms throughout.\n\nThis is the eighth and final track on MELVV's EP \"Polychrome.\" Distorted saw waves, crunchy machine drums, and vivid melodies swirl together on the lively, synth-based body of work that began as MELVV transitioned from major label to independence. While containing elements of pop, the EP pushes left into experimental electronic territory.",
