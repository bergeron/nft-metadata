    "description": "Humans are the conjurement of senses like touch, eyesight, and emotions. This celestial being is the consciousness that manifests beauty in this reality. \n\nAbout the art: I used an A.i. generator to merge two of my different art styles. I merged my Chrysanthemum 999 and Oni Blood Queen and I finished what it generated. \n\nWHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF VOLTAIC?\nVoltaic “pertaining to electric currents” is the namesake of Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist who experimented with electricity and is credited with inventing the battery. The Italian surname Volta has multiple possible origins, though many of the most popular hypotheses all circle back to the noun volta “turn; vault.” The noun volta ultimately comes from the Latin verb volvere “to roll, wrap,” which is the source of the elements containing vol- in evolution, involve, revolt, and volume. Another option is that the surname Volta derives from volpe “fox,” from Latin vulpēs. Voltaic was first recorded in English circa 1810.",
