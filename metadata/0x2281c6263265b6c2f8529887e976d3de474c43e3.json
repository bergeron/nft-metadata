    "description": "Holding this asset earns you the right to receive one free NFT from the Ludo Labs Genesis Collection. On 20th November at 12:00pm GMT, we will take a snapshot of all wallets holding one of these passes. Once the mint commences, mint pass holders will get airdropped free, randomized NFTs from the Genesis Collection. More details can be found in our Discord: https://discord.gg/ludolabs. Art by @MigratingLines, one of our favourite NFT artists - check out his other work at: https://foundation.app/@migratinglines. Post mint, these passes will remain in the wallets of holders where they can be enjoyed for the pieces of art they are, and will also entitle holders to minting benefits in future LudoLabs drops :)",
