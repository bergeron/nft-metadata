    "name": "The Goddess of Wind",
    "description": "The Goddess of Wind\n\nShe suddenly appeared in the sky. Her appearance was innocent and pure. Her blue hair was blowing in the wind. Her eyes glowed kindly with a tinge of blue. Her horns and wings shone in the sun, and her faithful servant dragon, trusting her completely, carried her through the clouds, splitting them with his powerful wings. He had served her for many years and was so happy to be in the sky with her.\nAnd she was only a goddess descended from heaven and controlled the wind.",
