    "description": "Coming Up Daisies is a playful collection of skeletons in bright, vibrant colors. They wear sunglasses, different hats, and some vomit flowers. The purpose of this collection is to remind us that life is short, and at some point or another, we all wind up pushing daisies. So take some joy from this collection and do what makes you happy and vibrant. We don't always have to take life so seriously. \n\n20% of the proceeds from this collection will be donated to the Winter Relief Fundraiser in partnership with Our Healing Hub to share food, clothes, gifts, and winter relief to our Indigenous Youth and Elders.",
