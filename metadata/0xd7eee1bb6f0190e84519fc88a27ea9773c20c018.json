    "description": "A cognitive reimagining of life paths presenting themselves within the threads of our predestination. Opportunities arrive and depart, as do our perceptions of intelligence and beauty. This reconstruction mimics our reconceptualization of everything we once experienced and imagined as time loops onwards.\n\nPoint cloud derived from 1430 photos I shot in Carmel-by-the-Sea (36.55476, -121.92235). Animated in Houdini and rendered with Arnold renderer. Point counts range from 144 million to 200 million throughout the thirty second piece. Final render took 245 hours. \n\n\nExhibited in the Bangkok Virtual Art Biennale \nSoundscape by Esbe",
