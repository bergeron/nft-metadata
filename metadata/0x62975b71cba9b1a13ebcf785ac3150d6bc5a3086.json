    "description": "I met Stan Lee once, he was a lovely man. I gave him this caricature and he was really taken with it. \n\nHe asked his PA to keep it safe so he could hang it in his gallery when he got home. I never got to find out if he did or not, but I like to think he did.\n\nHe did tell me \"good job\" though, which is like the Stan Lee seal of approval as far as I'm concerned!\n",
