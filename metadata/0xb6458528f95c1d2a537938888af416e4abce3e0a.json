    "description": "I knew you once. Your focus, and your heart. I held them briefly, but you grew in a way that became difficult for me to preserve, no matter how much I tried. \n\nI grew too. Perhaps why things became so heavy in the end. Perhaps why you let go. \n\nI still smell the sadness. Sporadic yet lingering. Not like overstayed cologne, but deeper, persistent, and unforgettable – like petrichor. \n\nNo wonder it’s in the soil I tread, the bark I touch, the leaves I rub and the air I breathe. \n\nIt’s in the bulbs I planted hoping the sweet scent of spring will be enough, this time, to guide me from your garden, into the meadow.
