    "name": " Arin - Guardian of the Sanctuary",
    "description": "It is Arin's presence that truly sets him apart. As the Guardian of the Sanctuary, he exudes an aura of power and authority that is impossible to ignore. He seems to embody the magic and mystery of the temple itself, and his regal demeanor is enough to make even the most fearless adventurers feel slightly intimidated.\n\nDespite his formidable appearance, Arin is a benevolent guardian who is dedicated to protecting the secrets and treasures of the Sanctuary. He is quick to lend his aid to those who seek it, but is also fiercely protective of the temple's secrets.",
