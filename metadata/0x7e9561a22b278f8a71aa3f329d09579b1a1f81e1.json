    "description": "An animated cinemagraph of a dystopian scenery in Boni Station, located along EDSA-Mandaluyong in Metro Manila, Philippines.\n\nThis very place was my home at an earlier chapter of my life. I used to live in one of the high-rise condominium buildings shown in this picture and took the bus to work at the bus stop below (also shown in the picture). I've always thought the scenery at this part of the EDSA highway is something out of a cyberpunk dystopia.\n\nOriginal photograph was taken in June 2020 during the rainy season and the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20 attempts to find the best combination of advertising on the electronic billboards. Photo enhancement was done in Lightroom and Photoshop, with animation in Wallpaper Engine and Premiere Pro.",
