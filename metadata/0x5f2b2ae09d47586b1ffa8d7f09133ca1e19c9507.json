    "description": "Water games at the Brandenburg Gate  \nFirst thought at Pariser Platz: the Brandenburg Gate. But there is more to marvel at. On both sides of the Berlin landmark, two identical fountains bubble up in the middle of the green space. The beauty is in the details. In both round natural stone basins, a crown of thistle-like tropical acanthus leaves sprays a multi-jet water fountain. The bronze crown of leaves was made in the 1880s by the Berlin-based Bildgießerei Kraas. A similar fountain is located on Hausvogteiplatz.",
