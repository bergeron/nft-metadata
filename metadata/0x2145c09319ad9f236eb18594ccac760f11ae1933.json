    "description": "The Miraculous Love Kids is a non-profit 501c3 whose aim is to teach the guitar to war-torn, poverty-stricken children, in particular young girls who have little to no rights and are often forced into marriage and face the most extreme forms of violence. We concur with legendary musician Charlie Haden who famously said, “Music in the hands of kids can save the world” and with that, we feel it is the most powerful way to give these kids a voice. Through the guitar, they learn English and about other cultures and countries. They also earn a stipend to support their families, which, in turn, instills in their self-worth and hope for a better future.\n\nI traveled to Pakistan to meet and photograph these incredible girls. Each one is a fighter with heartbreaking stories. I'd like to thank Matt Sorum and GoodNoise for inviting me to participate in this wonderful project.\n\nThis NFT Drop was created by Livia Elektra in collaboration with GoodNoise and Sthorm. Its proceeds will benefit the Miraculous Love Kids project.",
