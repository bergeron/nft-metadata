    "description": "At the epicenter of this horror and pain, everyone finds their own way not to die mentally.  Taras Kharkivsky found his way - close his eyes, breathe, breathe, breathe ....\n And instead of bombs, you already hear birds flying in the sky.  Instead of children crying, they laugh at outdoor games.  You plunge into your fictional magical world so as not to lose your mind.  So what will his next world be like?",
