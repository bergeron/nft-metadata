    "description": "      The fragrance of a lemon garden. It's impossible to mistake it for something else and really hard to forget as well as the green eyes of a young beautiful girl, picking these fruits into her old wicker basket.\n      If only we could imagine a new Eden Garden, it would probably look like this. But instead of apples there would be lemons.\n",
