    "description": "Ticasso: To be Blockchained , silenced , immobilized. Heavily chained by the very complicated problems the space may give . Challenges that require elusive solutions . Oh how the snakes of the space move the key to my locked heart farther away .\n\n\nMay I consume every snake , every bad vibe , and in turn show you my true colors . That I have so much pink love to give , a big purple heart to sacrifice , good colorful words to share even after I bite my tongue . To enjoy a collective vision, a perspective of how wonderful life can still be. Life is still a wonderful adventure, full of countless blessings that unlock the abundance of love in one's heart .  Finally, My Friend, may I spread my wings at long last ‘I am free !’",
