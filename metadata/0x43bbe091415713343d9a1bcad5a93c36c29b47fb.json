    "description": "In 2018 I had the opportunity to travel to southern Chile to track and photograph the pumas (Puma concolor) of Torres del Paine National Park. After 6 days of putting 10+ miles a day I still had not seen a cat yet. I knew I was in the correct location as evidence of prior hunts littered the ground. Late, on my second to last day, I found three pumas. An adult female, and her two subadult kittens. I spent the better part of 30 minutes photographing the two young cats as the fed on a rabbit the had just caught when all three cats slowly got up and began to leave. As they did, all three approached me to inspect what I was, allowing to capture this intense moment, which is forever burned in my mind.",
