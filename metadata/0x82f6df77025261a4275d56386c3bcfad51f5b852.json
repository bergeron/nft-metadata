    "description": "\"They tried to bury us, but they did not know we were seeds\" -  Dinos Christianopoulos\n\n\"Rooted\" is about life, death and rebirth. It also depicts our dualistic relationship with nature: our attempts to stay grounded, while putting pressure on our environment. \nAll flowers in this artwork were hand-picked, pressed, and digitalised. \n\nDigital pressed flower collage  \n3600px X 3600px  \n300 DBI\n\nThis artwork is authentic and was created by dodsicle; the purchase of the NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.",
