    "description": "The first of the Revelation Series, this artwork reveals the interpretation of my experience in this beautiful, complex world. Originally hand-drawn at 600mm wide using black ink pens, the drawing alone took over 200 hours to complete. My ongoing study of Sacred Geometry is applied in this drawing, transmitting higher frequencies of energy and awareness into the Universe. \n\nThis artwork holds a powerful energy and brings a calm, soothing vibe to the world. The last few years have been tough for so many people, and I hope this artwork helps everyone see that the world is still a beautiful, inspiring place to live.",
