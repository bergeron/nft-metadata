    "description": "### Introducing the 'Locked Version' of Flora Miranda's I AM DIGITAL.\n  Best viewed and interacted with on **Opensea** - just click on the **?** in the navigation bar under the book for instructions\n\r  A unique edition, a digital book that pushes the boundaries of traditional book publishing. Raising questions about ownership, copyright and collaboration, a selection of the 352 pages are locked behind a noisy blur function, generative design by Flora Miranda. Only if all involved creators agree, the artworks will clear up. What remains is mysterious: are the sharp fractions showing the true skills of Flora Miranda? Or does this say something about the different mediums, such as fashion cannot be captured in images without team effort? We blatantly realise how teamwork makes the fashion world. As blockchain technology is supposed to facilitate the fair split of income between collaborating creators the question remains - who will go through the coordination effort? And what if one person of 10 co-creators disagrees, will the image stay locked? \n\r 'I Am Digital' printed art book Information: 352 pages, hardcover, 2.5 kg, 29.5 cm x 25 cm. Published by Bruno Devos (Hopper&Fuchs), designed by Tim Peters. \n\r More information: https://shop.floramiranda.com/products/i-am-digital-book \n\r NFT Books Created by Metaverse Publishing www.metaversepublishing.io",
