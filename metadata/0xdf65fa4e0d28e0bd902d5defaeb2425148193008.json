    "description": "the photo itself was made a couple years ago with my friends when i was experimenting with different light effects.\n\ni decided to revisit the files a couple months back to do something in my current style and it just wasnâ€™t working out because i was constantly under stress because of work, personal life and health so i left it unfinished.\n\nnow when i finally achieved the freedom i was so desiring all these years of having the ability to create without worrying too much, without consequences of digging too much in my own head i created this and it feels like a breath of fresh air.",
