    "description": "About () { \nIn childhood I always Struggled to Fill the Geometric shapes in Schools Drawing Subject Know as संकल्प चित्रा That always Imbibed in my mind that I couldn't paint hence I couldn't be an \"Artist\". That block followed me to my Career choice but as destiny has it, I ended up being one.\n\nAmongst my struggle of being an artist, One Fine day I happen to visit the Retrospective Exhibition of SH Raza .Looking at his work from a distance of a Brush, That moment Truly liberated me. It broke all my Blocks of childhood regarding being an Artist . His Radical Strokes gave me Freedom from my blockages. I realized those blocks were nothing but Prejudices of people around me regarding what is art and Artist. Those strokes stayed in my Visual memory forever.\n\nOne of the magical night in world-wide lockdown of 2020 , In my Dream I met SH Raza. I expressed to him how I got inspired by his work and how liberating it is for my process. As I was explaining him my work I took a deep breath and closed my eyes , with utter audacity I forced out my Wish of Collaborating with him .\n\nTo my Surprise , He readily agreed.\n\nThis Series is reality of that dream .In this Series I have Computationally Replicated his liberating Stroke while Deconstructing the Images I have captured in Surroundings using Grids in Indian art . \n}\n\nUpdate (){  \nThis Token is Transferred from Opensea Contract to Custom Smart Contract .\n\nOriginally Minted on October 24, 2021 at 5:08 PM ;  \nhttps://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/33008596373126979602124797627209205656159942342686380897590445220866811756545\n\n}",
