    "description": "Pathfinders is Tdub's very first Animated-Still mint. \n\nSlip into a trance as the melodic cadence thumps thoughts away, and watch as these fireflies dance down the path showing you the way to their version of enlightenment. \n\nThe Hime or Princess Firefly, is a rare spectacle and native to the Japanese mountainous regions. Found near temple ruins they are said to be the souls of soldiers who have died at war. \n\nGetty Images photographer Tdub (Trevor Williams), has artfully created a piece that is a \"motion experience\".",
