    "name": "The Social Media Mask",
    "description": "This painting is called the Social Media Mask. This watercolor painting tries to show that in today's society, people have to wear a mask that is the opposite of their own reality to be accepted by society. This happens more often in women Because of the psychological pressure on them by social media, especially the Internet, they are forced to show a face opposite of themselves, and this is very upsetting for them.",
