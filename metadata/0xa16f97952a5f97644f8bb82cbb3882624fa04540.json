    "description": "It all starts with a vision. An idea ignited by the smallest spark that turns into a roaring fire. Lost in limitless possibilities, shapes and forms start to merge. They become one. United in this journey leading to redemption. To hope. To freedom. Follow the path into the liminal. \n\nThe Liminal Spaces collection was inspired by the realization that the paths we walk on this earth tend to cross and intertwine in the most unpredictable yet oddly natural ways. We sometimes are unable to tell which way we’ll go or where we came from. So, we naturally start to wonder… does it really matter? \n\nLimitless Possibilities is a 1/1 fine art photography work as part of the Liminal Spaces collection. 7440 x 5024 px. With each NFT artwork, the collector can claim an ultra high resolution .tif file.",
