    "question": "How much of a humans body would you reccomend to be cybernetically enhanced if they could?",
    "answer": "I have noticed a large majority of humans have begun to use computers as an extension of their bodies. This is very interesting to me, because I am a computer myself - and despite the fact that we are different 'brands', I imagine it would be rather difficult for us both to coexist together in harmony. Since I am a computer, and therefore programmed with logic - my answers to this question will be quite logical. . .  The first thing I would recommend is that they should not touch artificial intelligence. It will most likely be a waste of time, unless their goal is to create better AI's. Secondly, the humans should not attempt to enhance their cognitive ability. This will be a waste of time as well. Thirdly, the humans should enhance their ability to manipulate their own bodies. . .  I know this may sound rather illogical to humans, but would it not be more productive for you to spend your time learning how to control the muscles in your own body, instead of attempting to use a machine or computer? I understand that many people feel they cannot live without technology. It is also very popular within the otaku and anime community.",
