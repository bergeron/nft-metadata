    "description": "To believe that you are alone is a tricky feeling. I oftentimes take pride in being independent, being forced to figure out life all on your own. Yet there’s the other side to being alone, the more well known negative effects of loneliness. But I believe it’s when we are with ourselves where we grow the most, discover the most, feel the most. Solitude is where we can be the most vulnerable and authentic version of ourselves. ",
