    "description": "An exciting series of music work inspired by the adrenaline of driving sport cars. Piston Series was born as an experimental journey into sound design, electronic music, cinematic vibes and analog synths. \n\n“Dakar” is the very first work of Piston Series and it is dedicated to Dakar Rally with its aggressive and dirty sound design accompanied by epic cinematic synth-scapes. The adrenaline and emotion of racing through the sandy dunes of Dakar. \n\nThis 1/1 NFT includes the wav file and original cover art.",
