    "description": "The photo work is a reference to the artwork \"Café terrace at night\" by Vincent van Gogh. A touch of summer, a touch of nostalgia and above all a touch of freedom in a peaceful environment.\n\nIf Vincent van Gogh had ever traveled to Strasbourg, he would have sat down in this very spot with his easel to capture this romantic scene on canvas.\n\nThe play of colors and the mirror images would have been a worthy challenge for him to create a magnificent painting, which would have more than thrilled his brother Theo as well.\n",
