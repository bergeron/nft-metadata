    "description": "This NFT project is dedicated to helping pet affected by war\n\nThe illustrations will depict my pets against a backdrop of real destruction from the war in Ukraine.\n\nMy first illustration shows a Maine Coon cat named Naruto against the background of a ruined house in the village of Borodyanka, Ukraine.\n\nI want to draw attention to the fact that animals also suffer from war, just like people. \nPets are very often left alone at home, thrown on the streets, train stations, they also get shrapnel from shells, no one to take care of them.\nEvery sale will help the animals in my country affected by this brutal war to survive\nI will transfer funds to charities that take care of animals in need of food, water, medicine, etc. \n\nI would be very grateful for your support of my project!",
