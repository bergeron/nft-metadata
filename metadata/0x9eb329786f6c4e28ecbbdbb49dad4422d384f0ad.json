    "description": "For the last 10 years, Yaren the Stork leaves Africa during spring migration and comes to this small village where the story takes places. And since the first day he arrives at the village, they go fishing with Uncle Adem every single morning for 6 months. During the last couple of years, Yaren’s mate has joined them as well. Almost like a fable, this story repeats itself every year at Eskikaraagac Village. Uncle Adem’s boat is the only one that Yaren and his mate perch without being intimidated and they happily go fishing together.\n\nI witnessed this story during its 5th year and let the whole world know about it with my photos. It was mentioned in school books all around Europe. It was staged as a shadow play in Greece. A documentary film about this friendship was made and won the “Best Feature Documentary” at the Prague Film Awards. In turkey, spring officially starts when Yaren the Stork comes back to this village.\n\nEvery year, millions of people joined this friendship through these",
