    "description": "This is Emma. She is among her family whose \"souls\" are waiting to be transmitted into their host bodies. While they wait, she tends to their needs and educates them on their new life positions moving forward. \n\nThe Uncanny Valley is a term used to describe the relationship between the human-like appearance of a robotic object and the emotional response it evokes.\n\nIn this phenomenon, people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic.",
