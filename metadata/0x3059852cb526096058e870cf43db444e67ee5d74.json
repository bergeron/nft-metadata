    "description": "This photo was taken in Sanya Bay, China. \nMy wife and I were taking a stroll along the beachfront just enjoying the beautiful sunset when we came across this scene.\n A women sitting on the end of the rail playing some songs reciprocating the beauty of nature with her own little song. \nAnyone who passed by got caught up and observed her, she was oblivious to us all as she was so engaged in the beauty she was a part of and at the same time creating.",
