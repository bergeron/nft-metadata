    "description": "Blue sky and blue sea and blue waves.\n\nThere is a town across the sea and the birds are looking at it.  It's pretty far away for us. But for these birds, it's probably closer.\n\nThe birds can reach that place with a brief flap of wings. They are resting for a while for making a new leap forward.\nI stopped to take in the view and captured this moment.\n\nNow we're all looking at this blue scenery.",
