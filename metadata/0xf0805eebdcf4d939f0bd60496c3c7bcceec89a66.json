    "name": "The Act Of Absolution",
    "description": "Seeking absolution makes me wonder how it feels to be forgiven,\nit makes me crave the feeling of relief,\nrelief from having to carry all this guilt.\n\nLooking into myself, finding that energy only my inner eye can see,\ni search for the energy of courage to seek forgiveness from the wronged.\n\nWritten, is my possible future of how events would turn out,\nfaced with thousands of endless possiblities of the coming future,\npossiblities so many, feels like stars scattered all over the universe.\n\nUnnerved by this, i find the courage to see through these possibilities,\norganising them till i find the one to set me free from this chain of guilt..\n\nAfter forgiveness comes absolution, \nbut how can one be forgiven without facing the wronged.\n\nI seek absolution for my guilt\nbut weighs even more than i thought,\nfacing the wrong head on is the only way to make that weight light.\n\nFinally finding my answers, i come out of the dark and head into the light\nand relieve myself from the weight of this guilt.",
