    "description": "Fleeting irreplicable arrangements of objects, found materials, and imagery are carefully curated to coalesce into a singular image on my scanner. It is here that my process of scanography creates a hypnotic dimensional experience. Plays of shadow and light capture the varying textures and depths of field allowing these surreal compositions to extend off the page into our realm. As everyday items are displaced and human beings take on new composite forms, my series reimagines the world around us. I call into question our relationship to the dichotomies of modern life, where the natural and artificial continually clash against one another.\n\nOver a decade in the making, this series has generated numerous images that have now been transformed into NFT collections.\n\nGolden cardboar and flowers placed on a EPSON XP-211 scanner (2022)",
