    "description": "As opposed to elaborate stories, this art simply captures the idea of how dreams come alive in safe space, like a seed in good soil. A welcoming heart of love is one safe space where dreams can thrive. \n\nSome people aren't lucky to find safe space, but when you do, cherish it, grow in it and let your dreams come alive. \n\nThis work comes with a large canvas print that is powered with augmented reality and can literally come alive in your physical living space with the extra-layered AR experience.
