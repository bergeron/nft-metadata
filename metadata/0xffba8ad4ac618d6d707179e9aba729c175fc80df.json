    "description": "The Visions Project by artist Pablo Slenders. The artist investigates the encounters of different media within the same framework. Every time a unique version of the artwork Visions is created. His personal challenge is to constantly learn new things within the same framework and to discover how you can always tell a completely different story within frameworks in colours, textures, structures and more.\n\nThe artist believes that through repetition the line of these works of art becomes a reflection of his inner world, with each work of art the artist provides a small description of his thoughts and fragments of his life.\n\nVision X is a bold compilation of a few artworks created before this one.",
