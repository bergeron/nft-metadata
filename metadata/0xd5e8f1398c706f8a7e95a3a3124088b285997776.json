    "description": "Etymography is the result of intellectual efforts to lend a new graphic sign and a new vocal sound to the meanings of the words mankind uses to communicate. This action takes concrete form in the production of progressive pen sketches, seeking to obtain the image that best corre- sponds to my personal vision of the meaning in question. These actions, which I call “exercises in cultural de-training”, are important if we are\nto be able to violate the iconographic legacy that belongs to us and to find the graphic and sonic representation closest to us, in a creative rather than a destructive sense, in order to be more pure and open to new discoveries, with no presumption of inventing a new language to be adopted.",
