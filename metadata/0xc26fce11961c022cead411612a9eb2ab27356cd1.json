    "description": "With this collaboration piece between A-Mashiro and Wen, the artists are exploring the conflict between the order and the chaos. While the ink bleeding background flows and spreads in an unpredictable way. The simple geometry shapes on top provide a sense of order and stability to the composition. Together, they create a sense of balance and harmony.\n\nFrom up close, the intricate details of the screentone effect and the geometry shapes are more apparent. However from further away, the overall composition and sense of movement in the piece become more apparent.\n\nAnd it also symbolizes that two artists come from very different backgrounds. And it is this difference between them that creates conflicts but also brings harmony to this piece.",
