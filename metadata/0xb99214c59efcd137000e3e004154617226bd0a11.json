    "description": "\"Random Events We Call Fate.\"\n\nEach piece is an event divided into small components, and from the events the whole world and possibilities are formed.\n\nThe picture was painted in 2012, the artist was 17 years old at the time of creation of the work, the process of creation took about 2-3 months.\n\nThe author wrote only when it was possible to put \"soul\", because each detail is based on the mood and emotions of the creator on different days. Variety: laughter, anger, joy, sadness - all this alternates day after day, bringing each time new colors and (or) black and white tones.\n\nThe author decided not to reveal the details of the idea of creating each detail, because everyone can find them for himself, deciphering the reasons in his own way and using the perception and life experience.",
