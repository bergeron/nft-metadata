    "description": "Washi-ku is a city made of paper by the hands of the masters.\n\nHouse of Cézanne resembles the passion of its master for the art of painting. Father of the Cubism.\n\nAt first he might have seemed flimsy to the academy but he was passionate and tough enough to create an entirely new school. His work is the bridge between Impressionism and Cubism. \n\n\"Cézanne is the father of us all\" ... This line attributed to both Matisse and Picasso !\n\n''Washi-ku, house of Cézanne'' was inspired by his mastery of design, color and composition.\n\nDigital Mixed Media\n10666 × 16000px - 240dpi / jpeg",
