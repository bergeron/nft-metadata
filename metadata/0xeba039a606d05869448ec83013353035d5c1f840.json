    "description": "Cactus, Phoenix, Arizona, United States\n120mm, Kodak Portra 800 (Medium Format), taken with Mamiya 645E\nScanned at 300 dpi \n\nA cactus (plural cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales.\n\nTheir spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch, and are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. \n\nMany cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. \n\n- - - - - \nConditions are an ongoing series of photographs surrounding unplanned circumstances, moments in time that cannot be replicated or reproduced. They serve as documentations of past lives, growth change,",
