    "description": "One of my original mobile photographs showcases the power and strength of the Ain Dubai from underneath the supporting structure.\n\nThe curves and lines in the architecture of this build are breathtaking up close. Watching the wheel turn from the ground and actually seeing the movements in action is simply amazing.\n\nThe Ain Dubai is currently the World's Highest Observation Wheel. It is a superb facility and the sheer size of the project is awe-inspiring.\n\nArt specifications:\nB/W image\nMobile Photography (Iphone)\nDimensions 3024 × 4032\n\n*Buying this image does not give you any rights to sell as prints or merchandise.\n\nEnjoy - Pd :-)",
