    "description": "Super PUMA is a collection of 10,000 PFPs representing variants from other timelines and universes that have made their way to the present after the events set in motion by Evil PUMA. \n\nSuper PUMA was originally a comic book originating in the 1970s. The character has been given a digital makeover that will see Super PUMA’s story reinvigorated, highlighting historic moments in sport, but also pushing into new storytelling territory made possible by web3. Visit BlackStation.PUMA.com/SuperPUMA for more information. \n\nThe Super Puma collection is complementary to PUMA’s other ongoing NFT project the Nitro Collection, which will contribute to be PUMA”s vehicle to release new innovative shoe designs. \n\nNitro Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/nitrocollectionpuma\nTOS: https://blackstation.puma.com/Terms-of-Sale\n",
