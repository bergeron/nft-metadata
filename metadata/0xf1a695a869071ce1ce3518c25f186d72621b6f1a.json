    "description": "The Western Veil Nebula NGC6960.\n\nLocated around 2100 lightyears from Earth in the constellation cygnus. This beautiful yet chaotic formation of ionised gases and dust, often referred to as \"The Witch's Broom Nebula\" was formed between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago via a star around 20x the mass of the sun going supernova.\n\nThis was one of the first nebulae I attempted to image. Chosen for its brightness, colour and position in the sky. I was able to achieve this result after 2.5hrs of 1-1.5min exposures without an autoguider, using an 8\" Skywatcher Newtonian on a HEQ5 mount and an unmodified Canon EOS 550D.",
