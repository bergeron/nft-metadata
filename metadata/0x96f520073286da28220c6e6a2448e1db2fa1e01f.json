    "description": "Stop / Shaped by the West / Utah / 2016\n\nThe body of work made between 2015 and 2019 on solo road trips around the American West is rooted in the westernization of my home country Slovenia and the resulting lack of national identification, which significantly impacted me growing up. Shaped by the West is a personal and artistic exploration of Americana's emblematic symbols from my youth in opposition to my present identity. The series prevailing narrative is centered around a nostalgic vision of the American dream contrasted with my process of applying for an artist visa. The body of work has been created while traveling through Arizona, California, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada.\n    \nEdition Digital AP  /  1\nEdition S 20x15 / 10+2AP\nEdition M 30x22.5 / 6+2AP\nEdition L 50x37.5 / 4+2AP",
