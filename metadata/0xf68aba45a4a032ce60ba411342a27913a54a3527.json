    "description": "Title: Tropical Serenity\nCollection: Tropical Dreams\nArtist: Blue Jay Way\nEdition: 1/1\nLocation: Big Island, Hawaii\n\nWhere do you go when you are spent and need to drink in positive vibes, peaceful ambiance and serenity?  \n\nWe all have our happy places that help us rebuild strength and energy for our next battle.\n\nI look to nature - often northern, often remote, but sometimes tropical.  Hawaii's Big Island fits the bill.  \n\nThe kiss of the tradewinds, the rhythmic waves and the cheery birdsong soothe my soul and help me put my personal challenges in perspective.  I hope this image helps you do the same.\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups as long as it is attributed to “BlueJayWay.eth”.
