    "description": "A defensive perception, dubiosity is viewing the world with skepticism and incredulity. It is an active, often exhausting way to behold, but a valuable skill to practice as a framework for placing ranking on our perceptions which protects us from harm. One must be careful not to approach all with scrutiny, however, or it can close off new and awareness-expanding experiences.\n\nThis piece is a 1/1 edition carefully created by [Maneki Neko](https://foundation.app/@ManekiNeko). It began as a text-to-image collaboration with an AI. It was finished by merging images from five or more generations together to create a piece with a coherent color scheme, expression of a theme and packed full of intricate detail. \n\nEach piece is available in a printable resolution on request by the holder.",
