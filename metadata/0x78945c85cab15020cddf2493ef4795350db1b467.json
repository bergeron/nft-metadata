    "description": "ArabianNights is bringing the Arabic culture into NFTs with the help of AI. ArabianNights is a collection of all 1/1 legendaries that are of a limited supply of 666 NFTs relating to places, objects and people related to the Arabic culture. The inspiration behind this project was the lack of representation of the culture in the Web3 space. We have worked our hardest on incorporating several pieces that provide a greater depth and insight into the middle eastern world whilst making use of bright and beautiful scenic environments and atmospheres at both day and night to create an NFT collection that is bursting with beauty.",
