    "description": "In Sook Kim's 'Saturday Night' explores the painful reality of urban isolation. This piece showcases various stages of loneliness in 66 different rooms of a hotel, depicting the self-destructive strategies people resort to when dealing with solitude. The hotel guests, encapsulated in their rooms, embody a paradox of 'collective loneliness'. Despite their unique situations, they remain interchangeable, eventually disappearing back into urban anonymity.",
