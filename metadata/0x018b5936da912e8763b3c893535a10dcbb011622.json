    "name": "Loneliness",
    "description": "I was lying on the beach on a warm summer evening cuddling with a beautiful girl while watching the sunset go down and waves hit the shore when I noticed this young guy who slowly walked to the pier alone. He reminds me that one day you embrace a girl lying on sand, the other day you embrace your loneliness on stone pier starring at the endless sea...\n\nTwo years later I don't have this woman in my life anymore and the place where the image was taken is completely ruined. This is the beach of Azov Sea in Mariupol, Ukraine.\n\n\nThe file uploaded is guaranteed to be the only one NFT version. It contains all the EXIF information including the exact date of creation and GPS coordinates. And a little bit of my sorrow.",
