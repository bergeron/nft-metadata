    "name": "Desire on Fire",
    "description": "Desire is a bodily urge, more analogous to hunger or the blood’s need for oxygen like the Fire.\nSexual desire may be the only type of desire; psychoanalytic theory holds that all other forms of desire and creative energy are the result of rerouted sexual energy — often called “the libido” — towards other endeavors. The bodily urge of desire is only sexual in nature; everything else is an emotional state developed out of this primary desire.",
