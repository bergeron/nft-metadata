    "description": "This tryptic is a part of a series that explores the depth of patterns in my stream of consciousness art style and the layers that make up the complexity of my work. \n\nThis piece is a part of my first series of NFTs to be linked with physical works that can be unlocked via a token gate. The primary collector of each NFT will be able to claim the physical piece for delivery. These real world 12x12 artworks can be accessed via a website that I will have available on my link tree https://linktr.ee/Ashleymetro. The physical piece is also linked with an NFT chip that is connected to the listing. \n\nThis is my submission for the \"Tributary: From Daylight to Nightflight\" exhibition, an art walk along Ladybird Lake and Downtown Austin within Mixed Reality. In partnership with Illust Space, SearchLight is hosting this exhibit as part of SXSW 2022. Many artists from all over the world will attend and have their art showcased in XR all around downtown Austin.",
