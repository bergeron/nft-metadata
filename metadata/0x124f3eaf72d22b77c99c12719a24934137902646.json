    "description": "From one of my favorite shoots with Olga. In my home, the simplest of setups, the best of models, and just a good time are often the recipe for a great outcome!\nI feel when shooting with her that she understands where I come from, what I want to express. Maybe it also is why I chose here and what to shoot on that specific day. The process is what it is. Sometimes meticulously planned, sometimes a spontaneous expression of what you see and feel.\n\n---\n\n.: 2667x 4000 .: JPG .: 300DPI .: color .:",
