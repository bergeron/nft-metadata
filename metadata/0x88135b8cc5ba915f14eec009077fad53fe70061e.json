    "description": "the sculptures, with a hieratic attitude, appear concentrated in hearing the signals of Nature. They are not only listening but, also investigating, trying to figure out. The Toy Soldiers, as in the old photos of our grandparents, are trying to explain the desolation of a meaningless war fought by nameless people. Seriesâ€™s heores are not alone, colourful geometric figures are around their heads, as if they were saints with a golden halo trying to express purity to reveal us their light and deep thoughts, beyond fire and fear.
