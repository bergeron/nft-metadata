    "description": "A candid street-portrait of a dreamer from the magical streets of Kolkata city. \n\nWhile walking near Mullick ghat during a foggy winter morning, I spotted this little boy riding his bicycle around the ghats. I moved a little close to him and took a couple of pictures. After a while, he completely forgets that I was there and lost completely in his own world. \n\nI wanted something extra in the picture. I really liked his expression and for me that's the main attraction here. Out of no where I saw a group of birds flying and I couldn't miss this moment. I got the killer expression, birds flying over the boy's head and there is Howrah Station in the background all in the same frame. \n\nLocation: Kolkata, India\nEdition: 1/1\nDimentions: 4032 x 2688",
