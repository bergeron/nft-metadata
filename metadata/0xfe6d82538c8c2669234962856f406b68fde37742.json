    "description": "This piece was created as a derivative of Terrell Jones 'Born 2 Die' contest for his artwork of Skelliot Deville holding a sacrificial origami lamb.\n\nThis piece is to take Skelliot into a different universe, a time of the past. This shows Skelliot with a lamb at the top of a sacrificial ritual site where he has defended himself against adversaries and other obstacles. After facing the struggles to fight his way to the top, his last conflict to face is a decision.\n\nWill he make his sacrifice for all his desires or to let the lamb live a long life?\n\n--\n\nPaleInRed 2022  \n",
