    "description": "\"Can you feel the world slowing down, just for us? Suddenly nothing feels so important than we can’t just stop and breathe, think and be. It feels like we’re floating among the clouds, doesn’t it? This is home to me.\" - By Way of the Sea, EraLore Studios\n\n\nNatirupe is a speech therapist and mom, who was encouraged to start studying art after the age of 30.
