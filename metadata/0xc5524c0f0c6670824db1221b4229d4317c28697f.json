    "description": "50, 1989\n\nI am from New York. To me, the city breathes energy, stress and speed, and this is what my photographs express. Good work transcends the period and I think that my New York work stands up to the test of time.\n\nThe \"Bruce Gilden New York\" collection was shot over several decades. It has been published in numerous books and exhibited worldwide.\n\nThe collection comprises 50 street images, some of which are amongst the most recognizable in photography.",
