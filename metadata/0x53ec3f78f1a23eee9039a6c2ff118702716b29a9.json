    "description": "hi. i’m Annika Rose. \n\ni’ve been an artist in the industry since I was 9 years old, and man have i seen some shit - the good, the bad, and the ugly. \n\nin 2016 i lost my first major record deal, my family broke down and drastically reassembled…. i cycled through more unfulfilling deals and ghostly promises until the world was shut down by the pandemic.  it became increasingly more obvious to me that the only promise i could make was to myself and to my art. and the only way to relinquish control over it was to fearlessly trust in it. \n\n“Bruises” is a song i wrote about a friend. a friend quite literally covered in self-inflicted bruises, but more importantly it’s become about how others’ metaphorical “bruises” can so quickly become your own; how pain is so contagious, especially around people who you love and care for the most. \n\nthis song is my first audio nft; the daunting yet seemingly very special first step of a journey into greater ownership, creativity, and connection in my art. i’m excited for the world to hear it as a reminder that taking care of your mental health can be the hardest but end up being the most rewarding path to walk. for yourself and for everyone in your orbit.",
