    "description": "The year is 2021. The subreddit Wallstreetbets is championing a new breed of investor â€“ the degens. They are going to the moon, playing the greed of Wall Street at their own game, hoovering up as much AMC and GME stock with their COVID-19 pandemic stimmy checks to force that all powerful short squeeze. Lambos for everyone. A silver NYC subway car covered in graffiti stands as a testament of this new age.\n\n",
