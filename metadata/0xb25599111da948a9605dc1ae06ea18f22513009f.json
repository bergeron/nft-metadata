    "description": "Clouds, mists and fogs have never ceased to occupy a place in our imagination, to fascinate, to intrigue, to worry, especially since they were in the past inexplicable  a and could be linked to gods, demons and spirits.\nThe “Beasts” series is the continuation of the “Collapse” series. When pareidolia becomes a belief, a world is built and reflects our inner world. These once vaporous, silent creatures reveal their true form. Thus our beliefs can become colossal monsters and those of others may engulf us.",
