    "description": "I saw her in the old hall of the historic station, the last stop of the Orient Express.\nShe was happy from her peaceful journey and excited to set foot in Istanbul, the city she had visited for the first time.\n\nShe was in the historic hall, reading the newspaper she had taken from the train, while being mesmerized by the magnificent architecture inside and the light seeping into the hall through the stained glass windows.\nIt was a warm autumn morning and the light rising from the east was making another beautiful guest from the west fall in love with this city.\n\nNow, at the last stop, it was time for a new beginning.\n\nLocation: Istanbul - Turkey\nJpeg Size: 2690x3956/300dpi\nEdition: 1/1",
