    "description": "'Lines' is from MA1 \"Abstract Originals\" Geoff Davis Micro Arts Group 1984. This was the first generative art collection ever publically released. \n\nIn these new artworks, the generative art is running on six surfaces of a 3D cube, which rotates in a void, with synthesised music. This combines historical computer art with modern CGI virtual world graphics. Original music is provided by Metavista.\n\nOriginally only numbered (1,2,3,4 etc.) we now have human labels: \nWalls and Bridges in Hyperspace (Lines) \n\nMicro Arts software was distributed on data cassette and later Prestel videotex. \"Abstract Originals\" comprised seven generative artworks, and had a menu for colour control, order, etc.\n\n[View High-Res Artwork on Arweave](https://arweave.net/JkCkaFpeauqo2MtdUcgnQR_ATv7GsjvAAxIsIEJ0yvs/original.mp4)",
