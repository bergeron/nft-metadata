    "description": "I have two sons. My eldest son is called \"aref\" and my youngest son is named \"amir\". Aref was born on June 17, 2013 and Amir was born on December 27, 2013. I have been photographing my sons since the day they were born. All these photos were taken in 10 years. I took all these pictures with the camera of my mobile phone. By putting these pieces together, I made a picture of my sons. This photo consists of 600 photos. If you zoom in, the smaller pieces, which are the photos of my sons in these 10 years, will appear. I presented this work of art that I spent 10 years taking photos of then in nft format.",
