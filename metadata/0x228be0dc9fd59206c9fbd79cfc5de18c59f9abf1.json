    "description": "Before February 24, 2022, the day Russia invaded his country, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was an unlikely hero. His famous reply “I need ammunition, not a ride” when the US offered to evacuate him from the capital city Kyiv turned him into a 21st century Churchill and galvanized his nation into valiant fight.\n\nThree months into the war, Ukraine still stands firm. Unfortunately, the war has caused enormous civilian casualties, forcing many Ukrainian people, especially women and children, to flee their homes. So far, an estimated 6 million refugees from Ukraine have crossed borders into neighboring countries, and they are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nI want to do my small part to help Ukrainian refugees. So, I have created these 5 limited editions of ZelenskyArt collection for auction. All the proceeds from the sale of these collectibles will be donated to The UN Refugee Agency (www.unhcr.org) and the Red Cross (www.icrc.org) for Ukrainian refugees.",
