    "description": "Art means researching and searching for oneself through the prism of the history that dates back centuries. My inspiration for this collection have been the prints of the graphic artist Maurits Escher and the bronze sculptures of Yves Pires. I got my first album with Escher's works at the age of 13. His precise calculation and spatial thinking coupled with creation of surrealistic worlds captivated me. I have not become an artist in the conventional sense; however, I create my worlds, but my canvases are Jpegs, and my paints are the light that I use to “dress” my models. In this collection, I wished to transform the beauty of a naked body into graphic objects. Shift in proportions, exaggerated forms and pitch black colour are like the bronze works of Pires. Let them fly and overcome the gravity of your mind.",
