    "description": "‘Think of you’ is an unreleased song from the vault. Created out of annoyance. \n\nAnnoyance that my pen could only write about one mistake with one person. “I’m so tired of writing songs about you…” really means I’m so tired of having terrible experiences with you to keep writing about. \n\nWhy can’t I let this go? Are you just so fun and easy to write about?  OR is it that we are just so connected that it is going to take me a few more songs to be done completely? \n\nIf this is the case then I want to make sure I leave it here. On the page and in the song. \n\nThat I set this down to explore my other thoughts and qualms. Life subjects that don’t involve you. \n\nThis song was written in 2019. To begin something you have to end it. So I decided before my new material makes its way to the world. I will need to say goodbye to what I started. \n\nHere is “Think Of You” enjoy!\n\nwritten + performed by Yasminah \nproduced by Chini Slickback",
