    "description": "The FelixFelixFelixGallery is a miniature exhibition space dedicated to cryptoart that can be taken and shown anywhere.  \nThis project has started on the 22nd of October 2022 with a performance at Paris + Art Basel 2022 confronting famous cryptoart to famous contemporary art, two worlds still completely separate, ignoring each other.  \nThis gallery is on a world tour finding its opportunistic route from hands to hands and place to place. At each stop, it has to find a new holder that will allow the journey to continue toward a new destination.\n\nThis is model 0 (the prototype) built by FelixFelixFelix and finished the 20th October 2022.  \nA regular smart phone has to be inserted inside the model to serve as rectangular screen.  \nThis model comes in one piece and cannot be disassembled.\n\nSeen on the screen : Rinse and Repeat by @Clearing__",
