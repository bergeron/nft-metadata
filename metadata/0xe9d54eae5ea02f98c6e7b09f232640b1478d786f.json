    "description": "Power's faculties are comparable to those of an architect. She has the ability to locate places in the universe where the energy distribution is conducive to the development of a system that can inhabit life or have other interests. She also has the ability to predict the future thanks to precise probability calculations as well as to develop extremely precise plans that her brothers and sisters will follow letter to organize the universe. Placement, temperature, size, mass and radiation of each celestial body is the result of an infinitely complex calculation coming from the powerful mind of Power.",
