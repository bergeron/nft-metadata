    "description": "This work is dedicated to one of the most significant travel cycles: the pursuit of the summit in order to go down and find yourself there, in your roots.\n\nThe central and most contrasting part of the composition is occupied by a mountain peak as a symbol of aspirations and an obvious goal. However, this peak grows from something very simple, but more significant - the heritage of home.\n\nAt the foot of the mountain, my grandmother's house is depicted, gradually fading from memory, but remaining in it such a strong memory of the lost, but happy time of life that shaped us.",
