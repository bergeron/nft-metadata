    "name": "Grace Under Fire",
    "description": "\nStanding among the gently blowing sand and fading sunset, I'm fighting voices in my head telling me I'm not enough. I take a deep breath and look into the viewfinder — my eyes roving the contrasting shadows and fiery tangerine sky — not knowing exactly what I'm looking for, but having faith I'll find it. My lens lands on the soft curve of this dune, and immediately I am captivated by the remnants of sunlight dancing atop its face and falling in long, lean lines. \n\nThe grace I have for myself and my artistic journey may be under constant fire, but pressure is what produces the most rare of diamonds. With each journey into the dunes, I become more confident in who I am and who I will be.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
