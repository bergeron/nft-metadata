    "description": "She was alone in that dark night, trying to find a way to reach her destination. She wasn't scared of the darkness rather she knew her persona will lead her to the final light. \n\nIt is the light that defines our personality, shows everyone the power we hold and it is also the light that defines our inner spark. \n\nL U M I N O U S is a definition designed by me to highlight such persona in the 21st century, where we need to follow our inner spark to shine bright in this world.",
