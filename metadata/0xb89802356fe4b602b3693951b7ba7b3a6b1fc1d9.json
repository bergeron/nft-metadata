    "description": "Night Garden is a mixed media (auto)biographical record and exists somewhere between art and artifact. \n\nNight Garden documents the unreality of the modern condition as we take stock of seismic shifts in our individual and collective lives, and emerge from the great “going indoors” and consequential \"going within\" triggered by the global pandemic. \n\nThe series captures the personal journeys of 9 women – the artist and her tribe – as they confront the darkest hours and deepest truths of their lives. Personal journeys reveal common themes: of meeting the ugliness of oneself, hiding from self and others and navigation of psychological landscapes of profound reorienting of belonging, purpose and meaning. As the women emerge from the internal cacophony, seen clearly by one another and most importantly, by oneself, Night Garden arrives at a purpose: a reminder to audience to not hide. To look within. To look out for others, and ultimately, to step forward and be seen.  ",
