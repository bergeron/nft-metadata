    "description": "The souls of the dead are gone. All over the world, they've vanished without a trace. No one knows why or how it happened, but the reality is clear: unless they're found, these souls will be forever gone. A group of brave souls sets out on a journey to find them, braving whatever obstacles they meet along the way. They'll face mad gods, evil demons, and even their own doubts and fears, but they won't give up until every soul is accounted for. With time running out, can they succeed before it's too late?",
