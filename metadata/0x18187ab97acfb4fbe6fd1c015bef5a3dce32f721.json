    "name": "I - Architects' Utopia",
    "description": "Every utopian is an architect. Longing is the most perfect and unbreakable structure. The chimera is an idea built down to the smallest detail, a labyrinth of the most stylized obsession. But every construction cracks, every structure has fissures. The most robust building falls like a house of cards in the hands of time. Utopias need architects capable of seeing movement in the structure, capable of building on flexible foundations, capable of flowing with time.",
