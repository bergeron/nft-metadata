    "description": "Collection pieces:  50# \nAbandoned and frozen; as if they have preferred oblivion to existence while they are letting nothingness lead them. \nThey intend to reveal the afterlife by screaming in the vacuum of space. However, they don't give up the idea of a very futile effort.\nAs they realize that they are just an accident and their absurdity is eternal, they have to ridiculously perpetuate the death game and search death in endless lines of silence.\nLife is not just a transient silence and death not only in the afterlife's well-pleasing occurrence but also is representative of the short moment of existence. This is the endless loop of death called life. \nIn this collection, I have tried to show you socially unacceptable behaviors such as injustice, massacre, execution, and war.\nThese heinous crimes were perpetuated guilt throughout history. \nThis group of people has progressed so far in the extent of sin that other concepts such as forgiveness, justice, and kindness have disappeared.
