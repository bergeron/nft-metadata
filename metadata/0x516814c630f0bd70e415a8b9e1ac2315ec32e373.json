    "name": "Apocalypse at the Moki-Dugway Utah, USA",
    "description": "The photo was taken during a tour through the USA in 1996. In hindsight, choosing this route was very courageous for a mobile home. The view at the upper Vistapoint is breathtaking. The view on the graveled, narrow serpentine road close to the abyss is frightening. The weight of the RV pushed steadily forward and the dishes in the cupboards rattled in the back. We were glad when we got down.\n\nAfter almost 25 years, when I was regarding this panorama photo (several digitized and assembled pictures) of the Colorado Plateau scene, I got the idea of this apocalyptic composing. I had the moon from my astrophotographic photos, made with my 25 inch Dobson telescope.\n\nThe composing image (9728 x 3780 pixels, 300ppi, jpg) is offered as an single edition.\nWithout signature in the picture.\n\nÂ© Gerwin Schadl, Germany | www.world-of-pixel.com\n\nMoon Apocalypse Moki Dugway Utah USA Photography Photo Composing Landscape Colorado Plateau",
