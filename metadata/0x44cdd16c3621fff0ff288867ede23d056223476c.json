    "description": "The Bosnian War, which started on March 1, 1992, lasted until December 14, 1995. More than 100,000 people died in this war and 2 million people emigrated. The most dramatic part of the war took place in Srebrenica. 8,372 unarmed men were killed within days in a factory building where they were taken. During the three and a half years of war, 44000 women were systematically raped.\nSome of the income from this project will be donated to one of the women's associations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
