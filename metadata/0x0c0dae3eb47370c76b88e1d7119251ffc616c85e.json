    "name": "Jack of Spades, \"Between Two Worlds\"",
    "description": "The Jack of Spades, \"Between Two Worlds,\" is a story of adolescence. The Jack is based off a Congolese concept of the Kalunga. A circle that depicts the cycles of the sun and their relation to the living and spirits. Divided into four phases, the horizontal line is referred to as \"the waters\" and serves as the intermediary point between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Children are highly connected to the spirits having just been one themselves. I wanted to depict this relation through a child experiencing the mirror of the waters.",
