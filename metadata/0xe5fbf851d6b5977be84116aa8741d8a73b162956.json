    "description": "7ft x 6ft x 2.5ft Bronze Sculpture\n\nThe Soulbird is a symbol of the Divine Imagination. The soul and the winged angel are historically and archetypically fused. In Egyptian mythology the soul is associated with a human-headed bird called the Ba, which arises from the dying person as they release their final breath. This sculptural symbol combines the quad-faced angel with the body of a bird. Seeing in every direction at once indicated universal vision, the wings, bearing eyes indicate the flight of higher consciousness.",
