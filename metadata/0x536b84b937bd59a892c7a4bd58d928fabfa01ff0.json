    "description": "Season’s End by Downs & Towns\n\nThe sun had set. Others had returned to shore. But the lone fisherman in a small boat drifted across the horizon. The weather was changing and the season was coming to an end. Should he stay out? Make one more catch? Or give up and go back to shore like the others? \n\nThis boat was photographed on Lake Peten in Guatemala. We were there as part of a mission team that worked in a school for children with special needs. This image represents our choices each day. Do we follow the crowd? Call it a day? Say \"at least we tried\"? Or do we stay the course and try one more time?\n\nThe Photographer - Houston Vandergriff is a globe-trotting travel photographer based in Tennessee. Houston has Down syndrome and inspires others, both inside and outside of the disability community. He uses the universal language of travel and art to push for inclusion. \n\nHis photography journey has been shared in Newsweek, It’s Gone Viral, Aljazeera, Transcontinental Times, and MSN. ",
