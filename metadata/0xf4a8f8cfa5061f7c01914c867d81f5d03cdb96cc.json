    "description": "After starting to take nude photographs in 2004, I noticed something has inadvertently made its way into most of the photos, which is solitude. Both the so-called modern and the religious societies have the same disparaging attitude towards the nude art and view it as a taboo in a moralistic light. Consequently, in confronting a piece of nude art, it’s the naked body per se that gets the most attention and so it’s pretty hard to portray nudity as solely a formative component of an artwork.  Needless to say, a Nude art and erotic reception of the art work very much depends on the spectator and the venue of presentation. After the first set of nude photographs my main concern was to develop my own signature and present photos whose atmosphere is my own creation.",
