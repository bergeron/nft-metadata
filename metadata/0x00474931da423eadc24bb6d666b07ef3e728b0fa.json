    "description": "This is a painting filled with structures that resemble vines with leaves and layers that form a topography.\nThe composition ranges from areas of intense interplay between these two elements to spaces with no interaction at all. Hence, \"LIAISON I\" is a metaphor showcasing spontaneous interactions between these two components to mirror the interactions taking place within the physical world between two subjects; two people, two dogs, a person and a cat, a cat and its litter box, the litter and the sand, the sand and the ocean yada yada.",
