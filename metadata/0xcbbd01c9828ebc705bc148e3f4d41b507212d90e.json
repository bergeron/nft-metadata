    "name": "A LITTLE ARTIST",
    "description": "I think anyone can be an artist, including  a child with imagination and big dreams. Just be - happy to do it - like it - enjoy it - The result doesn't have to be perfect. Every artwork has its own story.\n\nIn this picture I tell the story of a young artist. (I represent Gin and myself as a child) who are having fun drawing in a room full of doll artist friends. The frame of the drawing doesn't have to be just on the chalkboard. We may be able to tell imaginary stories on papers or walls.\n\nGinâ€™s art (On the chalkboard)\n\nOn the green chalkboard, there are two best friends holding hands. They are surrounded by joyful little things showing how happy they are. \n\nOn the yellow chalkboard, there are two best friends too. They are smiling in a heart-shaped balloon because they love each other. \n\nAnd on the brown chalkboard, there are also two best friends surrounded by sparkling magical things which are drawn by the little girl. \n\nAll of these boards are about friendship.\n\n.\nFAHFAHS x GINSTER",
