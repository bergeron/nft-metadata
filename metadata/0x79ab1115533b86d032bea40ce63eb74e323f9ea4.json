    "description": "Phi is a number that appears all over nature, art, and ancient architecture. From Fibonacci spirals found in fruits and plants, to the design of the Pantheon. This piece is a tribute to the mathematicians who discovered the constant, and to the observers who calculated the size of the Earth and distance to the Moon.\n\nUsing sacred geometry > Pythagoras theorem > Phi (golden ratio), the size ratio of Earth and Moon is accurately derived. Encoded in the piece is also the Earth and Moon and Sun, all three sized to scale with the Moon being a few pixels in white, the Earth is represented as a black dot, and the Sun outlined in red in the back. The distance between the Earth and Moon is also true to scale.\n\nThe collection: Principia, is a visual ode to first principles. A series of 1/1s encoded with complex concepts and symbols, using mixed digital media, minted on its own contract.\n\nPhi Observer is the first piece in the series.\n\nMixed digital media: Collage, 3D, Illustration, 2022, Chema Mendez.",
