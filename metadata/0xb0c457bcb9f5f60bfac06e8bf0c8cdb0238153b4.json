    "name": "The Legend of Tsé Bit’a’í (Rock with Wings)",
    "description": "Tsé Bit’a’í (“rock with wings”) - Navajo Legends tell how Shiprock was a piece of land that became a bird, carrying the ancestral people of the Navajo on its back. After being transported from another place, the Navajos lived on the monolith, “coming down only to plant their fields and get water.” \n\nThe Shiprock ‘peak’ rises 7,177-foot from flat ground and is found in protected territory of the Navajo Nation. Located in the center of an area inhabited by the ancient Pueblo people, a prehistoric Native America Tribe referred to as the Anasazi, Shiprock is referred to as rock with wings” or “winged rock” thanks to the legend of the great bird that brought the Navajo from the north to their present lands. (Description Credit: www.ancient-code.com)\n\nThe moment I took this photo, I knew it was special. \nThe grandeur that this monolith presents is awe inspiring by itself...but when I saw the enormous cumulous storm cloud forming in the background, it was like two giants preparing to battle!",
