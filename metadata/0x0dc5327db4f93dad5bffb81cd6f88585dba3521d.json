    "description": "\"The Doors of Perception\" is my animated oil painting that I turned into a VJ loop. Sound on!\n- The name was inspired by the book \"The Doors of Perception\" by Auldos Huxley. This artwork is a story about personal transformation from the physical body into the spiritual and mindful version of yourself.\nThe original oil painting is available for inquiry as well on my website: www.kategoltseva.us\n",
