    "description": "Since the dawn of mankind there have been people whose sole purpose is to prey on others and scam them for personal gain. With the introduction of CryptoArt, this is no different.\n\nInnocent and naive artists are groomed every day by people who pretend to believe in their art and their message. They build up the vulnerable, waiting until an artist wanders into their trap before they pounce. In an instant, an artist can lose all they have worked so hard to achieve. But who are the people behind these scams?\n\nWhale is the fifth piece in the \"Impostergram Series\" a unique look into how not everything you see on social media is real.\nThis piece focuses on a person pretending to be an art collector, showing their life for what it really is outside of the internet. More often than not, these people work for someone else and dont see any of the money that they steal The next time you interact with a stranger proclaiming to be wealthy in your DMs, will you take more care?",
