    "description": "Heliosite is a rare and enigmatic stone with the ability to change color depending on its density. When found in its natural state, Heliosite appears as a dull, pale grey. However, as the density of the stone increases, its color shifts to vibrant hues of red, blue, and others.\nIn high density, Heliosite becomes incredibly reactive, exhibiting unique properties such as the ability to absorb and release vast amounts of energy.\nIts true potential and all of its secrets have yet to be fully uncovered, making it a highly sought-after and mysterious stone.",
