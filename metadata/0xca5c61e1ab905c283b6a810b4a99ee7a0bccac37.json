    "description": "An homage to death, a reminder to enjoy this experience to the fullest, whenever possible. Life is fleeting, each moment that passes is one less here in your body vessel. With this piece I hope that it encourages those afraid of death to embrace the reality of their existence and enjoy the experience they were gifted. The lines coming from the skull are symbolic of when a spirit transfer out the hueman body after the physical death occurs. Which is a belief in Tibetan buddhism that was a heavy influence on the design of this piece.",
