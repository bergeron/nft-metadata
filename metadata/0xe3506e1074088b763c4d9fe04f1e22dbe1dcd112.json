    "description": "This series features a collection of visual experiments on the screens created by the rotation or movement of numerous colored bars in space. The overlapping and scattering of the bars create a sense of virtual depth on the screen. In addition, the unseen force created by the Perlin noise influences the bars, generating energy on the screen.\n\nmp4 | 1080 x 1920 | 25fps | 24s",
