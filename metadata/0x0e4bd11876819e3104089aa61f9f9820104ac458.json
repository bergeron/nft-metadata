    "description": "The Me Inside Me is a reminder to yourself to sit back and find the real you behind the thick veil of pretense, that you like everyone else has put on for the world outside. We are shaped by our thoughts; we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves -- Buddha",
