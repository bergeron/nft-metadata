    "description": "\"Some girls wept or screamed,\nbut screaming here where the night\nis a dark glove covering a mouth\nis pointless when the hand\nclawing at your neck\nbelongs to a powerful man.\n\nI did nothing. Could do nothing\nbut close my eyes & wonder\n\nwill they return us\nback to the school\nthey stole us from.\n\nThat was some time ago.\n\nSome of us have kept our names,\nNaâ€™omi , Tabitha , Abigail, Saraya\nbut most forget the call of our mother.\"\nDedication to the Chibok Girls of Zamfara Nigeria",
