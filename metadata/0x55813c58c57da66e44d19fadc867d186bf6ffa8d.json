    "name": "The Flight of Light",
    "description": "1/1 NFT\n\nSigned physical print included\n\nThis single shot image was taken as the sun rose in Taranaki, New Zealand.\n\nTaranaki Maunga, the dormant stratovolcano you see in this image, is perched by the sea on New Zealand's west coast of the North Island. Cape Egmont lighthouse has been guiding ships by the light from this coast since 1881.\n\nAs the sun embarked on its journey above the horizon one winter morning, the birds began to stir and start their early morning chorus. One after the other, they each took flight from the lighthouse, until they were all gliding and swirling with the wind.\n\nTo me there is nothing better than starting the day with the first feelings of warmth from the sun, and the birds greeting the new day with such joy and encouragement.\n\nWith candy coloured sky as far as the eye could see to top it off, this image remains one of my favourites to date.\n\nRachel Stewart, Landscape Photographer",
