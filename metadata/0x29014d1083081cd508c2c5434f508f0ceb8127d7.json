It is a modified version of an image I created in December 2022 as part of a series of seraphim.\n\nThis is my genesis on the Ethereum network and was minted to meet a deadline for contracts to maintain eligibility for OpenSea royalties without blocking zero-royalty marketplaces.\n\nThere is a non-zero chance that I will update the image and metadata at some point.",
