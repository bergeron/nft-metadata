    "description": "Greenland was a dream destination ever since I was a kid. I never thought I would actually get the chance to go there so when an opportunity appeared in 2017, I was ecstatic, to say the least. I have since been lucky to return several times and it has quickly become one of my favorite places on planet earth. \n\nThis shot was captured on my first visit back in 2017. In fact, it was among one of the first images that I captured. The view of Sermeq Kujalleq, better known as Jakobshavn Glacier, can be quite overwhelming with ice as far as the eye can see but oddly enough, I find it to be quite meditative. Perhaps thatâ€™s why I noticed the little swirl that was happening. Having a feeling this would make for an interesting foreground I sat tight until the sunset began. This paid off and what followed can only be described as a battle between fire and ice.",
