    "description": "On 24 February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine.\nRussia declares that it does not strike at the civilian population, that the citizens of Ukraine have nothing to fear ... Unfortunately, this is not our reality, but just another cynical lie of the Kremlin's propaganda TV channels.\nHowever, do not hide the truth. Even now, people continue to update the news feed of official channels of public authorities to find out what is happening in Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson and other cities where fierce fighting is taking place. We are all worried about this intense anticipation of operational reports. However, the most frightening thing is the news of the dead. About those whose lives were unjustly cut short by someone's imperial ambitions. \nThe world must see the truth! \n\nРусский военный корабль, иди на хуй! \n\nСлава Україні!",
