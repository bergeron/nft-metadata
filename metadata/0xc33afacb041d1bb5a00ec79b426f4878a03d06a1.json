    "description": "This is a concept about something near and dear to why I create in the first place.  When I look at hidden patterns in geometry and space, I am driven to awe and inspiration.  \n\nThe nautilus represents the golden ratio which was one of the first mathematical patterns I discovered that shook me to the core.  Outer space was always a love of mine since I was a child.  \n\nCombining these two ideas into a single piece reflects the deepest motivations I have to create and open a window for others to see the same beauty that I see in the natural world.
