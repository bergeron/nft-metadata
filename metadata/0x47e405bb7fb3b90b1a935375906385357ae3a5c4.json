    "description": "\"\"Forged in Chaos\"\" ::\nPatricia Gloum, met Rob in 2019 a former ballet dancer from Juilliard NYC dance school. This is their second artistic collab and in this short film, \"Forged in Chaos\" , Rob narrates a poem inspired by his life as he is having a conversation with Josiah, the son he adopted in the ballroom Voguing scene. \n\nIt is common practice, to adopt each other to survive in NYC being both in their early twenties. Perhaps this is Rob's way of creating his own fam.\n\n\nYou will find this digital art playing in the short film.  This NFT was made in collaboration with digital Artist Jonas Ersland. \n\n\n****\n\nBesides having a valuable piece of art that will belong to history,  this NFT is a way to recognise the talents of the 15 talents that worked on this short. and compensate them bu giving me a share of this NFT.\n\n50% of the proceeds of this NFT will go as well to 100 echoPLUS, a solidarity program to support several refugee aid initiatives in Greece.\n\n",
