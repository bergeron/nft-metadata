    "description": "Oil on canvas 70x90 cm, 2022\nIt is possible to purchase NFT+physical artwork.\n\nThe feminine portrait on the painting is the expression of inner peace very much needed amidst uncertainty. Hands are a symbol of support, warm embraces and touches, a symbol of protection. That's why the woman radiates tranquility\nThe image of fingers as the most important sensitive part of the human body shows of touch which heals and soothes the soul.\n\nI think that's how the presence of the muse is felt.\n\n",
