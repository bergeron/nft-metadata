    "description": "The artwork explores the concepts of confinement and the limitations of our physical selves, as well as the interconnectedness of our mind and body. The multiexposed effect creates a sense of otherworldliness and mystery, as if the eye is a portal into another dimension.\n\n\"Trapped\" is a must-have for any art lover or collector who appreciates works that challenge the boundaries of conventional art.",
