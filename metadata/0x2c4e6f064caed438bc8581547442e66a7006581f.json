    "description": "When the three worlds were deprived of prosperity, the gods and demons churned the ocean. From it emerged Goddess Lakshmi, the source of all wealth. The lotuses appeared floating around her, encircling her in an attempt to garland her as she stood upon a blooming lotus in her regal glory. The pots began overflowing with wealth. As she unfurled her hands to bless her devotees, the material and spiritual prosperity flowed out. She manifested out of the ocean like poetry emerges on a blank page. The waves of the sea rushed to caress her lotus feet. Just as the emergence of Goddess comforted the three worlds, may this art bring you her auspicious blessings, prosperity and upliftment. \n\n** Non-Animated High-resolution version is available for collectors; contact the artist via DM. \n** Music/Vocals by Samarth Saxena, recorded in studios with pro musicians, exclusive to the Rebel Club's Diwali Collab, with 15+ artists. \n\nLicences\n* Artwork: CC BY-SA \n* Audio: CC-BY-NC-SA\n\nArtwork by Prashanth",
