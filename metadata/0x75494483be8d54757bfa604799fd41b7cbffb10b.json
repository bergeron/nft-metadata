    "description": "This pretty girl is the only daughter who did our job as a guard in our fields when I visited my village. it's so cute that he stole my heart by saying, \"can i pose for you?\" After our sweet little talk, he gave us this beautiful pose. Melis, it was so beautiful that I spent the day kissing her before I could shoot too many frames. He said he lived in the village with the family and loved the village. He gave me that pose himself. I put it on my wall by pressing this frame of natural pose and natural light. This shot won a prize in the contest held in the city where I lived. This yellow and warm square warms me up.\n\nArtis: Metin Burak KINACILAR\nEdition: 1/1\nCamera: Canon EOS 5D Mark 3\nLens: 35mm art\nExif: 1/640-F8-200 iso\nDate: 2015\nFile: jpeg - 300 dpi\nLocation: Gaziantep/Turkey\nImage size: 5129 Ã— 3419\n\nPrint: 1/1",
