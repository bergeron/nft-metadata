    "description": "There are many misconceptions surrounding Islam...Islam is complex, diverse, and liberating.\n\nMuslims come from all races, ethnicities and backgrounds. It's a global faith; Islam is one of the fastest growing religions today and is the world's second largest. Islam has always been full of strong women. \n\nIslam is Black & African. Islam is complicated and beautiful, with many unique traditions and stories, and a complicated history with colonialism.  \n\nIslam has always been a home for the crafts, elevating them to a sacred art. It is a refuge for the sciences, and a sanctuary for mystics, sages, and scholars alike.\n\nThere would be no European Renaissance without Islam.\n\nWe come from a long line of skilled craftsman, artists, astrologers, astronomers, and poets. Islam is both magical and futuristic; Muslims exist in the future. \n\n\nThis piece was created in memory & honor of Fāṭima al-Zahrāʾ (فَاطِمَة ٱلزَّهْرَاء). May her grave be covered always in libations and sweet offerings. Ashe. \n",
