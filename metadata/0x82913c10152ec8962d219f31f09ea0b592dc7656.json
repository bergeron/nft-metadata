Nothing is black or white, 0째 or  90째, right or wrong, everything is nuanced.\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for being such an important part of my life this year. Meeting you in the space may have been unexpected, but I am so grateful for the friendship that has developed as a result. You have brought so much fun and support into my life, and I am grateful to have you as part of my community from close or from far. \nSome of you definitely change my life in a way or another. \nThank you for being there for me through all of life's ups and downs. Here's to many more years of friendship and laughter!\n\nLe Sheraf.",
