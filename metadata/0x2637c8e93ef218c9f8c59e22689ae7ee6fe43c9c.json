    "description": "Let me tell you about my adventure in the English capital.\n\nDuring my stay, the good people of London, well primarily children, seemed gravely concerned about the structural integrity of a clearly beloved bridge.\n\nThe little ones clamored with no avail “London bridge is falling down”, and it seemed to me that none of the adults understood the gravity of the situation.\n\nSo, being the ever helpful, good-natured Trans Giraffe that I am, I lent my energies to the youngsters’ cause and the crisis was miraculously averted.\n\nHow we succeeded, I do not know, but I can say with 100% certainty that the London Bridge is standing intact.\n\nP.S.: do indulge my vanity friends, say, don’t I look dashing, post victory, in a London sunset?",
