    "description": "THE FRAGMENTED COLLECTION | 333 NFTs designed by @Fli, blending boundaries between Antiquity and Pop Culture. The Collection Includes a Physical Sculpture for each Holder and 33 Rare Gold Masterpieces!!! A project that speculates on languages and iconographies, emphasizing the lack of content, language, meaning, not simply based on the super-collection and sharing of images: rather as a part of a social relationship between people that is mediated by images. Driven by a compilation process that visualizes the complexity of the current digital age, resulting in a physical memento, highlighting the value of the leftover and at the same time sculpting a reminiscence of specific junctures in time. The project generates and digests forms of Beauty, moving from antiquity to popular culture and questioning the topic of heritage for future generations.",
