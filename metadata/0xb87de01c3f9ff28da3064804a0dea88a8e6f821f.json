    "description": "STICKERS-Every waking moment, most of us are deluged with images. Tens of thousands every day. From society, from media, from nature. Most of the information is discarded nearly instantaneously—but occasionally something sticks. It may be a humorous coincidence, a trick of the light, a moment of visual poetry. It is my mission to preserve the best of these moments—to hunt them wherever I travel. This photo is  one of my favorites. This image will always stick with me.\n",
