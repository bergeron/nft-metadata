    "description": "This war in Ukraine touched me personally and deeply. Being half Ukrainian and having relatives  still stuck in the war zone, I'm left with one thing besides hope - freedom of speech through my creative work.\nThis sarcastically \"delightful\" treat symbolizes Putin's sweet lies to the World and his citizens in Russia while the truth is way too obvious to the clear minded. \nThe blood of the innocent was shed!\nI stand with Ukraine.",
