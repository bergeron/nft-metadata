Though originated in Thanjavur, its craze and rage spread in the neighboring areas including Pudukkottai, Salem, Tirunelveli, Madurai, and Ramanathapuram\n\nKarakkatam is basically performed by an individual or two different persons with myriad acrobatic feats. The dancers clad in vibrant colored attires, carry intricately designed pots on their heads in an expressive and graceful manner to the rhythm and tune of the music played in the background. The pots are beautified with flower arrangements come along with a  parrot sitting at the top. The parrot rotating on dancerâ€™s movements is nothing short of a delightful visual treat.\n\n\n",
