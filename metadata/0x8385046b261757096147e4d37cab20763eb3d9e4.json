    "description": "“The average person will have more than 6,000 thoughts in a single day”\n\nIt is shocking to discover how often our thoughts are in cycles of the same circumstances. \nThe same fears… over and over again. Social anxiety, pressures and expectations, failure, disappointment…\n\nWe set ourselves up for success, just as we set ourselves up for failure.\n\nExposing all my flaws, accepting all my flaws, letting go of all my flaws.\n\nLet go of all that weighs you down.\n\n— rayseetoe -",
