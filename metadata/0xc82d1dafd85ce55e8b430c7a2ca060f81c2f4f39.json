    "description": "Agra, India. \nTaj Mahal. \nThis photo was taken in December of 2018 on Kodak Portra 400. \n\nOn an amazing trip through India. I got to spend this day at the Taj Mahal with my mother, her husband and my soon to be wife. The morning was cold and foggy and the Taj Mahal was actually not busy. I have been lucky enough to travel many places in my life, the Taj Mahal is one that blew away my already high expectations. \n\nThis is my first offering with foundation. This will mint as an edition piece. ",
