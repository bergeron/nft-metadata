    "description": "It has been close to 40 years in this extraordinary journey of editorial cartooning, and I am excited to embark on another exciting path on my art adventure through both a revisiting of old roots and embracing the new. \n\nThis piece represents the child-like wonder I have for what lies ahead in the Metaverse, set in a Christmas window setting. I hope that you do find meaning in this piece as it does for me. Merry Christmas!\n\nOriginal music composition is by my son. ",
