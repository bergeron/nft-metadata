    "description": "It is a globular star cluster\n\nwhich is located in the Centaurus constellation and was discovered by Edmund Halley in 1677; Of course, it is recorded as a star in Ptolemy's star map. Although it is not a star and is a star cluster, its name is registered based on the Bayer Omega Centauri star catalog. In the Milky Way, it is the largest and brightest globular star cluster, and in the Local Group, it is only brighter and heavier than Myel 2 in the Andromeda Galaxy. Aureus is completely different from the globular star clusters of the Milky Way and is thought to have a different origin.",
