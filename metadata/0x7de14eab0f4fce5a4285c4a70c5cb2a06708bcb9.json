    "description": "\nAs human beings, we are all a part of nature, space and time. Sometimes we want to manipulate the time, sometimes we need more sense of freedom. And every piece taken from nature is a loss from our own soul.\n\nI created these images during the Gezi Park Protests in 2013. Like many people in my country, I felt very deep sadness. Sometimes I wanted to slow down the time, sometimes I wanted to go beyond the spaces.And I felt like a tree uprooted.Because it all started with a tree.\n\nİntegrations series exhibited many times in Turkey.\nThe Time Bender was also exhibited in France in the project KadıNgözÜyle. It became an invitation to the exhibition and was published in press promotions.\n\n3000 x 3755 px",
