    "description": "Water buffalo (also known as 'dugga boys') in Botswana are associated with the northern waterways and floodplains. They're known for their short temper and water is essential for their survival, so they are often found on the floodplains.\n\nThis photo was taken in the Okavango Delta of Botswana - the last true wildlife reserve where its natural inhabitants live in the wild without much human contact.",
