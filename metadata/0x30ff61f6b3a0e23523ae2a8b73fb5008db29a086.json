I find myself seeing culture everywhere I go and just cant imagine how life would look like if there was none. When I close my eyes to sleep, I see myself connected with our tribal masks with cowries located at our fore heads as a point of contact (maybe why i always loved collecting cowries at the shores……lol). I hope to be back home someday so that I don’t lose the connect I have with my root. \n \n",
