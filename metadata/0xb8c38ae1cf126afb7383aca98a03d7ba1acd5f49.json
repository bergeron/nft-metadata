    "description": "Genesis (Adam) Gerbil was alone, and bored, and hungry, but thatâ€™s another matter. The Gerbi-net was a confusing place and he had no one to discuss with him the great questions he had. What is the value of a gerbil?   Is a fun one better than a non-fun one? Where is the peanut butter? Surely two Gerbils would be better than one - and many gerbils better than none. The button sat mutely daring him to press it. So Adam pressed the button.",
