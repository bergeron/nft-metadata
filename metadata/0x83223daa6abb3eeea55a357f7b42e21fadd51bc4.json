    "description": "This piece reflects the uncertain feelings brought up by the 2019 protests whilst living in Hong Kong. The writing below I wrote as a reflection of this time. The edited audio is original from my experience in the protests.\n\n\"She gazes over the great haze waiting for a future that will never come and a promise that wasn’t honored. As the pollution gathers, the dawn captures the calm brevity before the ominous giant prepares to tie the jackboot laces in preparation to stamp down the once vibrant city.\n\nAs the ghost town replaces its own words with its overlords’ publications, the waves of hopefuls chant in the streets for freedom. The few millions are left to gamble on the humanity of that which is not.\n\nShe sighs as the Island of Victoria, once ridden with colonial scum, sinks into the bay with the rest of the lot. There is nothing heard or seen, together with but not together, one country but two countries. The system breaks and ceases to exist.\"\n\n\n",
