    "description": "ANSWER (TYPOGRAPHY) is an original poem written by Julie Marie Wade and interpreted by Layla Pizarro.\n\nPizarro is a multidisciplinary artist based in Chile. Her practice bridges two distinct realms: figurative realism and non-representational abstraction. Her works are a reflection of her days and her experiences, ranging from analog and digital painting to digital and experimental photography. She also uses AI as a generative tool.\n\n—\n\nANSWER (TYPOGRAPHY)\n\nYou should know this. There are places\nI won’t go in a poem, doors I won’t open,\nchasms I won’t cross. The reason, Dear\nReader, is that there is someone I love more\nthan you, whose body beside mine is more\nsupple than this page, & for all my life,\nI want my head to be welcome on her pillow.",
