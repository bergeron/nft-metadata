    "description": "The art was made a tribute to Qinni - a young, talented artist and a little light to the darkness. She passed away in 2020 at the age of 29 after battling cancer.\nI canâ€™t believe that the art community has lost such a person so quickly. Rest in peace.\n\nThis art was created and featured for an art book project run by Qinni's brother - Ze Han\n\n1527x2160\nIllustration by Hikerumin",
