    "description": "Constantin Brâncuși's sculpture ‘Bird in Space’ does not portray a figurative representation of a bird in flight. Rather in its elegant, vertical form the weightless and airborne energy of its subject is represented as a potent symbol of streamline elevation. 'Flight' is my AI painterly homage to Brâncuși's golden symbol. In it I breathe space around the monolithic form of the feather by contextualizing it into the vast blue sky. \n\n'Flight' was curated by Clair Silver in 'HOMAGE' exhibition held at the Constantin Brâncuși Center of the Craiova Art Museum, 1-5th June 2023.",
