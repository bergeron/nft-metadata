    "description": "Was time flowing or were people flowing? Maybe it was the flowing human...\nIt was as if a watchmaker wanted to touch his past while repairing centuries-old watches. Whereas clocks always showed \"now\".\nHumanity has always wanted to correct time like a watch repairman. They oscillated between the past and the future. They moved between the hour and minute hands. They wanted to mend time, just like a watchmaker. but the truth is; Clocks show \"now\". And when we change the present,everything changes!",
