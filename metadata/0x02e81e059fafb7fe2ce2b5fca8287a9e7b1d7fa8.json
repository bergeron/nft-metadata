    "description": "In reference to AFTER HOURS - Scenes From A State Of Mind.\n\nAFTER HOURS tells the story of a sensation or feeling that comes to a person after regular operating hours, such as peacefulness, heartbreak, serenity, or regret.\n\nOn the ground, light has faded now and objects become hard to distinguish from the background or each other. They seem more like silhouettes. Your color-vision gives way to shades of tungsten as there is no longer enough light for your eyes to differ between detailed color schemes. The horizon is still visible while the sun sets 12 degrees below.\n\nOnce every 24 hours you are given a short time frame to capture Nautical Twilight and the scene you have pictured in your mind. The imagery is so beautiful yet haunting -- filled with love and devastation.",
