    "description": "It was not long ago that barter was the main way to exchange goods and services. \n\nOver time, the desire for a more efficient means led to the use of gold as a medium of exchange, and its lustrous shine soon became a symbol of wealth and power.\n\nFor the sake of convenience, precious coins were adopted in the ancient world and eventually, paper money paved the way for international commerce.\n\nWe Are Here #1 is a moment in time before we completely transcend the systems of monetary exchange we have collectively built and move on to a new programmable frontier.\n\nIt is an urgent immutable remark.
