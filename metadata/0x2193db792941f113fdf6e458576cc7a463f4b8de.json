    "description": "Like many others, I am fascinated by the charme of discarded production sites. I can feel their history, through details on their walls and remains of machineries that recali sounds and smells of abandoned processes. And I think of the people who used to work in these places, expert artisans, technicians, workers who mastered professions that do no longer exist. \nMy attempt is to give new life to these abandoned locations by introducing in the bare space a metaphysical element that is an echo of ancient productions. In this case - a plate-glass manufacturing plant - the \"virtual ghosts\" are glass-like globes that float in the air, filling in the space and permeating it. ",
