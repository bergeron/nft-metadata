    "description": "Mixed Media on A2 Paper (420 x 594 mm);\nConsisting of Oil Pastelle, Pencil, Fine liner pens, Paint, Coloured Pencils, Paper layering and Exacto knife.\n\nI feel the appropriate title is 'REJECT FEAR' due to this piece allowing me as someone who is primarily a digital artist to venture into the traditional world. It was a lot of fun making this but still using my style and workflow from digital. It has opened my eyes to a new world for my work, and hopefully many more\n\nThank you and enjoy the physical!",
