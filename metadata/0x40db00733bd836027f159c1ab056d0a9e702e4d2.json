    "description": "This project is entitled \"if I could not see...\" It originates from my fear of blindness. As a visual artist, the thing that I fear the most is not to be able to see ever. What if one day I lose the ability to see things, how can I continue my work?\nThis project is composed of series of 75 photographs taken using a pin-hole camera, and the short film tell a story about a transgender with visual impairment who loved travelling and taking photos.\nWhy pin-hole camera?\nFirstly, it is compact and easy to carry on.\nSecondly, it makes me like I feel like I am losing my vision. There is no camera lens, either a view finder to create a perfect composition. It makes me lose my capacity to control what I am creating, as if I were blind.\nOf course, most of them will be totally over or underexposed that I cannot do anything in the darkroom but I am happy to continue shooting it with the feeling of excitement and expectation of what it is going to be.",
