    "description": "Orcs of the Illuminati. These orcs could cast all sorts of spells of protection, attack, dexterity... But they were very obsessed with the pyramid and carried it around with them everywhere they went. You should know how much fun these dudes make me because of their love for the pyramid. They made a cult out of the fucking pyramid. Yeah yeah, the pyramid! And why is that? Because one day a pyramid-shaped stone fell out of a monster they defeated in battle. This stone had a strange gradient color and was slightly illuminated. It's a completely useless stone.",
