    "description": "Katie's story began about 30 years ago. Her father, a resident of one of the struggling countries, was an ordinary engineer in a radio appliance factory. His factory was abandoned because it wasn't profitable for the authorities. Other workers went to work elsewhere, and Katie's father wanted to put together something that would bring life back to the factory. He put together a humanoid robot, a robot that could help people perform difficult tasks, an android to make life easier. He could even program Katie's imagination, but he could not teach her to love others. Katie lived with her creator for the next eight years, his father was called insane for creating a soulless golem, and he had to go with Katie to the deep woods and live away from other people. A few years later, Katie's father died, long suffering from a heart condition. What does the future hold for Katie?",
