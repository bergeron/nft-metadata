    "description": "Everything or Nothing \n\nReflection on the topic of human self-identification. \n\nThe path of self-identification is a process of distinguishing oneself from animals, objects, animals, other people. What is human essence, what is \"I\"? A collective image of everything that exists or a unique form? An entity with a soul or a bunch of matter? Cosmic appointment or mere chance? Everything or nothing?\n\nThe work was done as a digital collage of photos of my body.  Used digital drawing, scanning, hand drawing.  Bare feelings and sensations.\n———\n2 0 2 3",
