    "description": "***Theyyam*** is a popular ritual art form of dance worship in Kerala, so ancient it predates Hinduism (500 BCE), though it has since adapted to include Hindu elements. Itâ€™s believed to be thousands of years old, from a time when tribal animism was the most common form of worship. These roots are still evident: trees, plants, and animals are worshiped alongside Hindu gods in Theyyam rituals. Some rituals involve blood sacrifices.  ",
