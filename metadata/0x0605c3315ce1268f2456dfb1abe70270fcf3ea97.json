    "description": "Moco’e Pavo is Camilo Restrepo’s illustrated and tormented alter ego and avatar. A pink humanoid sketch with a big nose, sharp teeth, and big green eyes permanently widened in hysteria, he is constantly committing gruesome acts against himself. Each violent action plays on a loop like, as Restrepo describes, “a disagreeable thought that refuses to vacate your head.” Through Moco’e Pavo, Restrepo unpacks, redirects, and mocks his anxieties and obsessive suicidal ideations.",
