    "description": "Bustani's Matthew Pandolfe collaborates with fashion and costume designer Casey Caldwell for Caldwell's 2020 collection. In addition to being a fashion photographer, Matthew Pandolfe most often also becomes the creative through line for designers to express their visions. As Caldwell specializes in experimental design using unconventional materials to create striking and conceptual pieces, the goal was to capture and highlight wearable art that blurs the lines between costume and fashion, gender binaries, and reality and fantasy. The garment featured is a hand bleached and dyed ghillie suit created from thousands of industrial zip-ties. In making this piece available via the ethereum blockchain, Matthew displays a model for ensuring equity to all of his collaborators and subjects. \"Visionaries such as Casey Caldwell deserve equity in their collaboration and contribution to culture and expression!\"",
