    "description": "\"War is all around us  \nMy mind says prepare to fight\"\n\nThis picture is about the chaotic feeling that the end of the world is near. However, I also feel that something better is coming in the near future. Maybe I choose to look back two decades and party like it's year 1999.\n\nThe work of art is the digitization of the painting that bears the same name. An acrylic painting with some holographic touches and some yellow vinyl textures, also a kind of little crystals.  \nThe physical piece has measurements: 24x17cm.",
