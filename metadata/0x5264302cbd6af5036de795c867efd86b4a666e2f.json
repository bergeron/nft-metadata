    "description": "Sonyashnik is one of the first potvor.\nNo one knows where he came from and how he appeared, but according to legend, Sonyashnik is a creature with an infinite source of darkness inside. He did not want the darkness concentrated in him to penetrate the outside world. Therefore, to contain it inside, Sonyashnik was forced to absorb the light of the Sun. \nBut one day there was so much darkness he was unable to contain.\nSo darkness penetrated the outside world, which was the beginning of chaos.\nIn the darkness, new potvorys were born and they scattered around the world, the World, which has since been called Potvorniy world.",
