    "description": "When I saw this elderly couple in the grand bazaar of Tehran, which is constantly crowded, I thought to myself, \"Everyone has their own story and battle in themselves.\" The man was so calm, whispering to himself, and the woman was counting the money; perhaps they were worrying about something. I adore documentary photography because it allows me to look for and experience the stories.",
