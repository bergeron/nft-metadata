    "description": "Before the advent of Islam in Central Asia, Khatun was the title of the queen of Bukhara. According to the Encyclopedia of Islam, \"Khatun is a title of Sogdian origin that is carried by the women and female relatives of the GÃ¶kturks and later Turkish rulers.\"\n\nAccording to Bruno Di Nicola in Women in Mughal Iran: The Khatuns, 1335-1206, the linguistic origin of the term \"khatun\" is unknown, although it is probably of ancient Turkic or Sogdian origin. De Nicola states that before the Mongol expansion into Central Asia, khatun meant \"lady\" or \"noblewoman\" and is widely used in medieval Persian and Arabic texts.\n----------------------------------------------\nFrame wight 1500\nFrame height 1500\nLength 00:00:12\nFrame rate 24.00 frames/secend",
