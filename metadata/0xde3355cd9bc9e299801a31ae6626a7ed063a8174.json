    "description": "All funds received from the sale of these elements are supposed to be used to help the Ukrainian army and Volten organizations\n\nMy name is Kirill Sibiriakov, Iâ€™m 3d artist and co-founder of Artcore Studios, Ukrainian\n\nI live in Kyiv, Ukraine. On February 24th our lives have changed. Russia invaded my country motivated by mythical reasons and in fact using pretty similar propaganda explonation as Nazi Germany did in 1938-39 invading neighbours.\n\nOn russian propaganda they say they targeting only military infostructure, in reality they bomb our cities, schools, hospitals. Yesterday 16 children died after russian bombings. People desperately crying, it feels like hell on earth. \n\nWith these photos, I want the world to see the real evidence of the atrocities carried out by the Russian army. Killing civilians. Also, my goal is to help the Ukrainian army and volunteer organizations. Don't be left out! Ukraine stands to protect the whole world",
