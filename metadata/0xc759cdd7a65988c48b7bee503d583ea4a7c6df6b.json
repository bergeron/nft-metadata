    "description": "I give to you The Great Hamily Gathering. A snapshot of early sail-o-bot life. It is for the collector to interpret the legitimacy of the narrative and only the brave will uncover the truth.\n\nHamily lore is the best lore. \n\nFor the love of all things Ham, 50% split will go to The Hamily. The Hamily is a group of artists, collectors and general enthusiasts of the prosciutto coming together to act as stewards of the ham.\n\nTo celebrate sail-o-bots being granted CC0 by Che-Yu Wu. This artwork follows suit.\n\nCC0 with thanks,\nSkife",
