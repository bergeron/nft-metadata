    "description": "The Galtonia Linifolia is a scarce, huge plant and can be found only at river borders. It blooms twice a year, for 2 months.  It has thick, wedge shaped leaves, which are usually forest green. It also grows small flowers, which can be light gold, silver and dark bronze.    These plants grow alone, but within a decent distance from each other, but it's hard to control and maintain their growth.  They can be used to treat wounds.    As a defense mechanism the Galtonia Linifolia grows large thorns.  They rely on cloning themselves by growing a new specimen to reproduce.",
