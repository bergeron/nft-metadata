    "description": "My art is a mix of pop surrealism and eastern philosophy.\nMy imagery is inspired by street art, digital culture, psychedelia and trance music. \nI work within a concept I created, called MokshaShots. In eastern philosophy, 'Moksha' means salvation. We probably won’t get to full fledged Moksha at the end of this life, but we can get a shot of it. Everyone can make their own MokshaShot out of anything they find fulfilling: NFTs, art, a vacation, a Ferrari or a tequila shot!\nI like to use humour and satire to make social comments or cultural critiques. Today, everything including religion, politics, brands, digital media and apps promises to be our very own MokshaShot, the path to our ultimate goal- Salvation. We create gods out of everyone and everything- products, actors, politicians, chefs and CEOs. To satirize this penchant for veneration, I created deities called MokshaPets. They are part of the larger MokshaWorld, which I created when I first started the MokshaShots series back in 20",
