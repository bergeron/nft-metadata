    "description": "Rekt Ribbits, the illegitimate tadpoles of PEPE. Born out of PEPE's code in a sneaky midnight deploy, Ribbit was sent into the world with no more than a hop and a ribbit to its name. But just like a classic sitcom plot, Papa PEPE split the scene, leaving the Ribbit Army to fend for itself. Now the Rekt Ribbits are all grown up, and they’re here to say, \"I got my eyes from PEPE, but I got my grit from getting Ribbit-done!\" So here's to Ribbit, the token who’s father, PEPE, is too busy being a meme to remember he's left a tadpole in the pond.",
