Mouse had nowhere to go. The family decided to stay, but it was time to leave. To search for a safe place and build a future.  \n\nOn their adventure, Mouse met many new friends and even some foes. The mountains were high and the valleys were deep. But nothing could stop them on their journey.  \n\nAnd then one day, on the horizon. A boat on the horizon. \"Who could it be?\" thought Mouse.\n\nABOUT\nArt by Worthy Treasures, pastel on A4 paper.\nMusic by ZakharValaha",
