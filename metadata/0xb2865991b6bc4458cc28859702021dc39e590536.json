    "description": "With this work, I wanted to emphasize environmental pollution and the climate crisis in the world. Woman: It symbolizes fertility, existence, and the gold leaf on it emphasizes earthly values. The cracked earth, on the other hand, emphasizes the destruction of the symbol of existence, the woman, by the human hand, because of the damage we have caused to the world. We exist and become land, but we do not cease to harm nature.",
