    "description": "The VITO 100A comes with a single, beautifully crafted button - the only button you'll ever need for a fulfilling and fruitful artistic career. The moment you press that knob, VITO 100A instantly creates a fresh, emotional, incredibly impactful cutting-edge artwork, so good that you'd think it was made by Rick Vito himself.¹\n\nHere's what paid actors say about it in a blind test:\nSarah (62): \"Well, I don't know, it probably makes art like you said. It's hard to tell without being able to see it. Oops, I think I pressed a button or something.\"\n\nTanner (19):  \"I've heard it has healing powers, but my mom says it makes art.² I guess art can heal or whatever but I've never had that happen to me, so. Can I take the blindfold off?\"\n\n¹ The art is in fact made by Rick Vitos from parallel universes and covertly acquired. Copyright does not extend across The Multiverse.\n² The VITO 100A does not have healing powers, it only covertly acquires or \"creates\" art.\n\n---\nRick Vito, August 2022\nDALL·E 2",
