    "description": "The concept comes from the soft robotic experiments in the NASA laboratory. It breaks the definition of the hard appearance of the robot and applies it to the soft tissue that can realize soft walking as muscle. The same is true for this series of works. People running around the city, including the author himself, often feel mechanized, and our appearance of running towards different ends is constantly liquefying, As the world's definition of the universe changed and space and dimensions changed, our bones finally became fluid, melted, and paralyzed on the ground. Before that, we even had fantasized that we had mechanical arms.",
