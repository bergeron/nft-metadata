    "created_by": "Stuart Schultz",
    "description": "This beautifully composed image is Barry Bonds’ very last game time swing. This image was taken by me on September 26, 2007 at AT&T Park in San Francisco. Barry’s last at bat was his 3rd trip to the plate that evening as he left the game soon after.\n\nIn this at bat, Barry’s first two pitches were balls. This NFT captures the 3rd pitch by San Diego Padres’ pitcher Jake Peavy, where Barry takes it deep into center field, missing a home run by mere feet.\n\nI personally took this image and it has never been posted on the internet. I’ve been patiently waiting for the right technology to come along and thank goodness for NFTs! Of special note in this image - yes, that’s the ball coming off the bat in the front grass area, just beyond the Home Plate Area.\n\nNote: Included is also an oil on canvas painting of this image in an approximate size of 80x55cm.\n\n\nDetails:  \nHome Plate Umpire – Marty Foster  \nPadres Catcher – Josh Bard  \nPadres Pitcher – Jake Peavy\n\nCamera – Sony A100  \nLens – Sony 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Zoom Lens",
