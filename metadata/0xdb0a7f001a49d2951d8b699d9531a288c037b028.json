    "description": "The Original Carpet Dimensions: \n\n100 cm (length) * 60 cm (width)\n39’ 3” in (length) * 23’ 6” in (width)\n.\nWhen I had 20 years old, I started to learn carpet weaving, at that time, it was pretty unusual because of the social chaos we had been through, but I found this art as a peaceful and calm realm for myself to be surrounded by! \n\nThis carpet which is my very first creation, has a unique value to me, and I tried my best to tuck it away through all these 40 years! Maybe because I weaved it just during the revolution. I would love to call this piece of art probably a symbol of humanism and love that may last forever.\n\nThe most crucial point is that, if anyone would like to collect this piece of art, I would pleasurably send The Original Carpet to the dear owner to show my respect and gratitude for this act of kindness.\n\nMay anyone live in peace and love.\n\n2022, February 20",
