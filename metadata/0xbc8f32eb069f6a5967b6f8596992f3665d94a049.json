    "description": "Acrylic Paint on 8\" x 8\" canvas panel by Ju1ceM4n, 2021.\n\nAbstract Sunflowers - Maybe not the most original concept, but there is also a brashness in tackling sunflowers in 2021. While their associations are obvious, “Abstract Sunflowers” takes an instantly recognizable icon and forces us to view it through splashes of extreme color varieties and nature’s elements. The result is a fresh, striking batch of intense paintings that will immediately provoke conversation among whoever is in their presence.",
