    "description": "<Stock trading elf series: 12>\n\nRecently, the decline in the stock market has been prolonged and trading volume has decreased, making Tinya bored\n\nAs the trading volume decreased, the number of stocks that could be traded decreased, so there were many days when I could not trade at all\n\nTinya often beats me on the head, overturns the table, and complains\n\nIt seems that the stress of enduring the desire to trade stocks is quite large\n\nUmm... I checked my bank account balance and there was quite a bit of money Tinya had earned from stocks\n\nCome to think of it, we... have been earning money and not even thinking about spending it\n\n\"Shall we go on a trip?\"\n\n\"trip?\"\n\nI called a taxi and headed to the airport with Tinya\n\nPraying that I won't be kicked by Tinya anymore...",
