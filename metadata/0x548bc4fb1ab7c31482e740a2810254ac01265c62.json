    "description": "Covid19 diary day one. \nA breakfast with a white bread.\n\nOnce in the past the Covid 19 entered in our life, do you still remember? I was stucked in a hospital for a 15 days and everyday I was capturing the details I surrounded by. The aesthetic of a hospital life: meal, meds, things and routine. My photo protocol was one and only thing that helped me during these 15 days of recovery.\n\nAll pictures were made with iphone, no additional light or props. Just the reality.\n\n",
