    "description": "When I make any good song (at least in my opinion), it starts where I don’t think about anything in particular, so that in the moment - I won't be critical of anything. I enjoy freedom in painting the melodies, then seeing what words come out, and experimenting with the beat that is presented to me. Sometimes I change the lyrics, or sometimes, I don’t. Case by case, I think the feeling of the song can speak either way. On Sixteen, I liked the dark melodic tones and the busy hard hitting drums. I wanted the song to match that same feeling and not seem to overpower the music but to compliment it. It feels somewhat easy listening to me as well.\n\tIt made sense for this song to be released with sound.xyz not only because of the lyrical ode to Hodling crypto, but because I believe in Web3’s future in the world. I appreciate the art and community that it has to offer and want to have my part in it. I hope you enjoy the song and look forward to more releases and collaborations with others on sound.xyz. Special thanks to Snapz, Santo, Wallis Lane, Clay, Summer, Cooper and Katrina.\n\n",
