    "description": "This artwork depicts a young girl swinging on a playground swing. She is sitting on the seat of the swing, holding onto the chains with her hands as she swings back and forth. The girl is likely smiling and having fun as she enjoys the sensation of the wind rushing past her face. In the background, there may be other elements such as a playground, trees, or a clear blue sky. Overall, the artwork captures the joy and freedom of childhood play.  \n-  \nMade using PicsArt on my smartphone  \nResolution - 2000×2500 px  \n-  \nEnjoy ♡",
