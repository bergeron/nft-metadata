    "description": "It's a hot summer day in 2003, you go out and buy a packet of NFT cards. You arrive at home, sit down and with little to no expectations tear the packaging to reveal what's inside. And you cannot believe what you see. With the content of this one particular package you can easily pay for multiple months of your life, no more ramen noodles or frozen pizzas.\n\nYou smile - you hit a jackpot today. Looking out from the window you see birds flying across the warm sun. You smile even more, you can finally breathe.",
