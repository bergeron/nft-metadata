    "description": "Mola Art Parrots. The Red and Green Macaws do live in the Panama Rainforest. \n\nA parrot is a bird, often vividly colored, with a short down-curved hooked bill, grasping feet, and a raucous voice, found especially in the tropics and feeding on fruits and seeds. Many are popular as cage birds, and some are able to mimic the human voice.\n\nParrots represent voice, communication, and the power of words.",
