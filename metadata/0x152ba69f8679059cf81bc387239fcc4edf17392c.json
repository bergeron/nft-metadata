    "description": "'The time we spent together is a dream, but it is not an illusion'.\n\nMost Ziggetai traverse the Nine Realms randomly, with no control over their destination or departure. Only a handful have discovered the knack of inter-dimensional travel. \nThese few are legendary among their fellow travellers.\n\nSatsuki Beni dwelled in this country for a hundred years, content to learn the language and study the customs of the gentle and generous natives. She’s a rare one, even among the Ziggetai.\n\nIn the Yukaku District, removed from the ravages of reality and the chaos of the Nine Realms, she made her home. However, her ageless beauty is beginning to inspire unwanted gossip from the locals. And disturbing rumours have reached her ears from the Worlds Beyond. \n\nSo, Satsuki has set off on a pilgrimage to her favourite shrines and temples to say farewell to the spirits who have watched over her.\n\nShe doesn’t suspect that her every move is being watched. She doesn’t know her life is in great peril.\n\n",
