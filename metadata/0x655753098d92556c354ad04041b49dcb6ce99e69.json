    "description": "Aka-ri, a young orphan boy from a small island in the middle of the pacific, left by his parents due to a rare disease. Since that day, Aka-ri is left with no one besides himself and decides to explore everything about this world. Aka-ri would prepare all the necessary things to take on this adventure, with his trusty change to bird-like and “feathery” giant manta ray named “Ruru”, equipped with engines from scraps of abandoned plane crashes on the island. Long story short, they flew towards on an adventure with no end as if they’re chasing the sun.",
