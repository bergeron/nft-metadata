    "description": "The Colorado Plateau in the USA is an impressive landscape. It gets really surreal in the evening when the weather is nice and the sun goes down. Then the rocks and sand turn into a bright red landscape and even the clouds and the sky turn pink from the reflection. \n\nThe popular motif is at the entrance and parking lot. When I took this photo in 1996 - another of my \"grande pictures\" where the place, time and light were perfect - there was only a wooden house belonging to the reserve administration where the fees were paid. Much has changed in the meantime and the location is often overrun with tourists.\n\nI took the photo in September 1996, analogue with my Canon camera on Kodak Ektachrome 100.\n\nThe optimized photo (7295 x 4766 pixels, 300ppi, jpg) is offered as an single edition. \nWithout signature in the picture.\n\nSee also:\nhttps://www.world-of-pixel.com/blick-ins-monument-valley-view-into-monument-valley/",
