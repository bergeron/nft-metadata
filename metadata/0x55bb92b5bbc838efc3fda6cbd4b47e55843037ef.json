    "description": "Quantum loops is a series of animated abstract artworks consisting of a few elements moving on a continuous loop. It represents perpetual energy and electricity that is constantly around us even though it’s invisible. It’s life at its most perplexing and mysterious state. A particle will behave one way and a completely different way once observed, and this very duplicitous nature is in a way a reflection of all us, since we are all made up of particles.\n\n1/1\n2160x2160 px",
