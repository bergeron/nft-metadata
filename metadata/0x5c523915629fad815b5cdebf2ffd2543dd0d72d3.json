    "description": "It was a fine day when i went to Hongkong's ocean park. I passed into this dark subterranean passage that was lit only by the fresnel light through the water above. I noticed this silver-haired tourist hastened her steps while taking pictures of the spectacular aquatic life. The caustic patterns of water reflection and the graceful movement of oceanic creatures evoked her emotions. As she raised her face towards the light, her serene joy and intense excitement was clear as crystal. Her euphoria filled the emptiness of the room.  \n\nArtist          - Karlo Flores\n\nLocation    - Hongkong \n\nEdition       - 1/1 \n\nDimension -4839x3226 (300dpi) \n\n",
