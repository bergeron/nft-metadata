    "description": "In 2017, I decided to leave France to start over in the US. As a kid, I was fascinated by American artists. I really wanted to write my own story there.\n\nOne of my first assignments was to capture the cityscapes of Seattle, WA. To spice things up, I decided to board a ferry to capture views from the water. The light was very special that day. Walking through the cabin, I noticed a man reading a newspaper. I sat behind him. The scene made me think I was in a Hopper painting.\n\nThe photo was exhibited at the Saatchi gallery and published in famous newspapers.\n\n",
