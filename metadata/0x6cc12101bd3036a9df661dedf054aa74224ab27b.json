    "description": "Edward Hopper has been part of Sandrine’s imagination for a long time. They have a friend in common: loneliness. But loneliness brings us to a place of great creativity. In Sandrine’s “House by the Railroad,” Hopper, solitary and in deep introspection, turns his back on a new dematerialized, virtual world represented here by his famous mansion, pixelated as if straight out of a video game.\n",
