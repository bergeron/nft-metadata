    "description": "Kim Jong Il's childhood was once filled with wonder and awe, his eyes sparkling with curiosity and his heart beating with passion. But his parents, blinded by their own ambitions, forbade him from studying the delicate beauty of flowers, condemning him to a life devoid of wonder and enchantment. Denied the freedom to pursue his dreams, Kim Jong Il turned his yearning for knowledge into a desire for control, his thirst for power consuming him like a raging fire. And so, the once-innocent boy became a tyrant, his soul twisted and tormented, forever haunted by the dreams of the flower-filled fields that he could never explore.",
