    "description": "Our world begins to divide as the glue of love fades and lifeâ€™s passions consume. You inhale today with no care for tomorrow. She sips her pain away watching you crumble, like a rolling stone hurling off a cliff. As you chase the night like a Man who has never seen the day. Yet, the sun always rises and you must face it, sword unsheathed, sacrificing everything that holds you back from the thoughts that give you life, racing endlessly inside your mind. \n",
