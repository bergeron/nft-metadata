    "description": "Young, Wid & Free is one of best shots I've ever clicked. The picture is depicting how free organisms are living there life happily, people trap some organisms to pet, but my friend they don't want to get trapped, the want to break free.\nBack in late 2021, I went to Udaipur. One morning I went Ambrai ghat and the ghat has a beautiful view of Taj Lake Palace. I was trying to get some unique frames. Got this frame and started clicking. I clicked more than 200 photos then got this one.\nFurther processed in Adobe Lightroom.\n\nPhotographer- Akash Pratap Singh\n\nEditon- 1/1\n\nLicense- The collector is free to use this photo in any kind of way, except commercially.
