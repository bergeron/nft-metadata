    "description": "We may find ourselves reaching for—or reacting to—a mysterious inspiration. An inspiration that can seem isolating, as if you're cast away. To be cast away as defined—to be thrown away or rejected—is a frightening thing to consider. Alternatively, being cast away as an experiment in isolation can be contemplative, motivating, and peaceful.\n\nIn 1989, at age 22, I cast myself off to an Alaskan unknown.\n\nIn 2018, my daughter Evalina stepped into her own Alaskan adventure, to study marine biology.\n\nWe made this on her first day in Alaska.\n\n\nLICENSE - Extended Editorial.\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
