    "description": "Lore\nIn the Matrix, to which people bend, reflects the hope, to give the living heart faith until death. Golden lifelines in the divine order. We ask for grace and recognition and long for the infinity. The time.\n\nCreation\nThis painting was created by hand in week 15 in the year 2021. By means of a 3D scanning process, combined with an algorithm, the overall image was calculated from 112 individual images.\n\nStory\nThe painting was created during a tearing trial of the artist. The question of the origin and meaning of life is central. It reflects the aspects of a messily structured, all-connecting truth that visualizes that everything is intertwined. During a week, various emotions flowed into the picture: Love and hate, self-confidence and despair, order and disorder, happiness and sadness and ultimately life and death.\n\nAuction options!!!\nGo to guidetomemory.com to see the options",
