Take a closer look! It's you! It's all of us! Our life is a constant struggle for our place! Go outside, look around, you will see a lot of people, each of them has its own way! Close your eyes, and here you are alone in this vast world, and no one else! At this very moment you realize that only you control your own destiny, and no one else has the right to stop you!\n\n1385Ñ… 1731 Pixels\n",
