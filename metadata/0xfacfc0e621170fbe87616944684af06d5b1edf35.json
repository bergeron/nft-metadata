    "description": "Am I getting closer to perfection? Or is perfection approaching me?.. Looking at me slightly, thoughtful, confused. It asking: \"And do you really need me?\" \n\nDo you know what the special privilege of a creator is? He can see his art at every stage of its creation. He observes all the versatility of faces, moods and meanings contained in each stroke. It is in his power to decide when to stop, which strokes to capture, which to keep secret and when to declare the creation ready. This is truly magnificent!",
