    "description": "Advancing into the 21st century, the lines between human and robot are increasingly blurred. This fuzziness elicits an array of complex emotional responses, just as it provokes technological questions.\n\nServant, Child, Lover.\n\nThese titles are chosen to represent three of the most evocative emotional relationships we can experience towards tech. Each of the three creates a sense of allure and excitement, but equally, distrust and fear - the paradoxical insecurity inherent in any human relationship.\n\nWhat, or whom, will be of greater service to the other? When we die, will our faithful servant’s lights go out, too?\n\nCould we learn to embrace a wayward child’s independence, knowing it might be our legacy?\n\nWhat sort of coding could make us fall in or out of love? Are we biologically / hard wired to self destruct?\n",
