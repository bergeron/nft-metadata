    "description": "'In indigo sky countless stars blossom'\n\n\"Stars\" part of NFT Factory INDIGO exhibition\n\nNewton distinguished 7 colors in continuous gradation of white light decomposed by a prism, including blue, indigo and violet.\n\nHowever indigo has since been repeatedly challenged as an individual color.\n\nA color theorist wrote that he could not understand individuality physics attributed to indigo, what was the particular action of this “seventh color”, what was its complement or opposite. For him indigo was just one of many shades of blue.\n\nLater a scientist pushed a hypothesis that only certain people physiologically had the ability to distinguish indigo from blue or violet.\n\nAs G.Baker decided to use the rainbow flag as symbol of diversity, he eventually excluded indigo to make a 6-color flag that would be easier to fold in half.\n\nWhy was indigo repeatedly excluded and even negated as an individual color?\n\nIs it questioning the human society ability to identify and value infinite diversity nature provides?",
