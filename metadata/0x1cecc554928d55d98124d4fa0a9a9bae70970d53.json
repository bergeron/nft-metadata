    "description": "When her steps are released from not being confused\nAnd slowly goes into inside herself\nTo be calm\nWithout judgment\nWithout the fear of not being\n.\nAnd starts dancing\n.\nThen the mountains and rocks stop buzzing\nAnd they look at her in amazement in silence\nThat dance makes wonders\nA miracle that you can only touch with your heart",
