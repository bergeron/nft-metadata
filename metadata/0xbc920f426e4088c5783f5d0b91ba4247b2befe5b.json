    "description": "This artwork may or may not bring a Valentine to all NFT survivors.\n\nLOEV YOU  \nThis piece of art is not about an individual experience or NFTs. This is about the way that we wear our heart on our sleeves and we believe in things. Whether that be the crush you had in 3rd grade that you wanted to love your Valentine's gift so much, or that NFT project that you had fallen in love with and wanted them to not rug.\n\nWe have all had heartbreak in our hearts in many ways. This is a way to symbolize that there's still love in the NFT world. We can spread it through positivity and emotions.\n\nThis is my gift to you all. An NFT Valentine to all that will have it. Enjoy and pay it forward; you never know when someone needs a heart.\n\n\nâ€“ Inspired by VV Checks",
