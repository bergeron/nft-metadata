    "description": "How possible is it for a little girl to hide her fears behind a curtain? Even though life forces us to push behind the curtains with fears, worries, problems and difficulties and to look at life through a small hole, we have to be brave against it. Our experiences leave traces in our souls. As the traces increase, our experience increases.\n\nI was traveling in a small town in Anatolia. This little girl was watching me with a frightened look. At first he was afraid to stand behind a curtain and approach. After a while I started talking to him and we became friends. I took a picture of him as he continued to stare at me from behind the curtain.\n\nTrace Photo won 2nd prize in a competition held in Singapore. He won the Honorable Mention in the competitions held in Turkey and Azerbaijan. He achieved success in competitions held in the United States, Albania, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
