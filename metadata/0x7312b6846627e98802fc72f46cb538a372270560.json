    "name": "Bridge of Intuition",
    "description": "There is more beneath the surface than what our eyes initially see. Intuitions greatest compliment is an entity that is aware of its callings and acts on it. The mind will do all that it can to take the easier route but experiencing the magic that occurs when we take those added steps is worth everything! Driving over this bridge, I took one glance over and had this feeling deep inside that it was worth stopping for. I could sense great connectivity to something much stronger. I had been stopping, charging drone batteries and had another spot that I was excited for plugged into the GPS. I listened to whatever it was that took over me though and it paid off. Fear is what would close this bridge off and send you back home.  Release that fear holding you back from the next stage you know you should be in. Most people don't think things can be done because so many people turn back when they see just how much work/time that it may take. Don't ignore your calling! Welcome to the Shadow Realm",
