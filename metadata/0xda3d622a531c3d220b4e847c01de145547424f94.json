    "description": "Humanity strongly influences the planet. Various cataclysms occur in the world, which have an extremely negative impact on nature. Fires are one of these problems.  \nFire is destruction, it burns everything in its path. The spirit of the forest is forced to leave its home. It is running from death and crying for help.  \nThis is a digital version of an art that won the Grand Prize in the creative competition from WWF in 2019.",
