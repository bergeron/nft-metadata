    "name": "Lupins BOS#1",
    "description": "Time-lapse duration: 81 hours\n\nThe name is derived from Lupus, the Latin word for wolf, but the reasons for this are not clear. It may be that in ancient times, Europeans noticed that lupins grew on barren soil where no other plants ventured and it was thought that they had in some way attacked them. In fact Lupins can live in such poor conditions because the plants can transfer nitrogen from the air to to the soil via their roots. The Lupin flower represents happiness, appetite, creativity and imagination.\n\nThe mandala is a symbol used in Buddhism and Hinduism to represent the universe. It is also psychoanalyst Carl Jung’s archetype for the whole self. A deeper layer of unconscious that Jung called the ‘Collective Unconscious’ - the universal part of our unconscious we all share. \n\nThe initial collector only will receive a beautiful unframed 16”/40cm limited edition print numbered between 1 to 50 with a signed certificate. Printed on Canson Baryta art paper inc. worldwide delivery.\n",
