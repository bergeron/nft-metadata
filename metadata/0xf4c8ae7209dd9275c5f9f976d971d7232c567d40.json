    "description": "Entry for the Garrid's Ethereal Hunter's Contest! I love Yuzo so I picked him to draw. \n\nThe concept is simple, I thought of hunters and somehow it became an angel of destruction. I'm sorry if this is out of character, but I hope that this artwork is still enjoyable for many!\n\nThank you for such a nice contest, Garrid! Be sure to check out the ethereal hunter collection here: https://foundation.app/@garrid\n",
