    "description": "“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” -Nikola Tesla. This token unlocks a buildable WORLD microverse in the Blue Plasma Realm of the LeapN Multiverse. If a token holder builds out their world in collaboration with other Blue Plasma Realm Token holders and reach a specific amount of online ‘unique viewers’, the team receives a reward. If the collaboration mixes in members from any of the other three realms (Red, White, Green), this will activate additional rewards and/or (fun) consequences.\r\n\r\nBlue Plasma Realms make up 25% of the second dimension occupied by LeapN.\r\n\r\n(Token Art & Animation by: Helindu Witharana | Sound Design by: Naraudio)",
