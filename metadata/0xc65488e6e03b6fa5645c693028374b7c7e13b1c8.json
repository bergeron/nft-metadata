    "description": "Neizan Nagger #001 -  1/1. Digital handmade manufactured in 2022.\n\n\nFrom ResETH series “DIGITAL BEINGS\" which mixes the real world with the blockchain, giving a new and eternal life to different personalities. This collection features 50 unique NFT’s, and this is the first one.\n\n  I believe every person shines with their own light, even if they don't know, and that's what makes them unique. With this collection, I wanted to give visibility to the light I see in people and make it last forever. I wanted to transform them to prove that even like that, they keep being themselves. Because what makes us different it's our \"soul\", not just what we see on the outside. It's not about what we look at, it's about what we see.  \n\nVideo of the #001 creation process: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/htTNYa8oQzE\n\n  Includes:   \n\n- 4K portrait video (.MP4)\n- Own Soundtrack of the NFT (.WAV)\n- Secret files of the  real person behind Neizan (.pdf)\n- Picture 2892 x 4338 (.TIFF)",
