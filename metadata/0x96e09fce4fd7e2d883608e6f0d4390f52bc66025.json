    "description": "The intro to the fucking album! So I wrote this song years ago from the perspective of a girl who gets left by her man. A man who she held down through his come up and now he's dipping on her just because he can. \nI also decided to make both the intro and outro of the album just my voice and guitar. It just felt right for the style and sets the tone for keeping an open mind throughout the project. See link for all the juicy deets!",
