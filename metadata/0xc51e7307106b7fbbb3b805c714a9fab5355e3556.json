At UnimagenNFT we created this piece of NFT Art unique in its kind. “The CatiLisa” was Inspired by the “Mona Lisa” by Leonardo Da Vinci. In this picture you can notice tattoos, a smartphone, piercings, eyelashes, and a different body shape from what we are used to see.  \n\nEmbark in this series of the “Never Seen Collection”, and allow your mind to travel to a different world here at UnimagenNFT.\n\nResolution 120cm x 80cm",
