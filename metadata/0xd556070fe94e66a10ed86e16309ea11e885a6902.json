    "description": "Over the years Iâ€™ve photographed various reflections of New York City seen in the windows of glass skyscrapers from high atop their rooftops in Manhattan. I couldn't believe the first time I saw how much of the city can be seen reflected down the sides of the skyscrapers from on high. It felt as if I'd discovered a sort of hidden dimension that had been there all along, waiting to be seen.\n\nThis image was taken from 45 stories above 6th Avenue with my lens pointed straight down at the city below.\n\nNew York City / 2011",
