    "description": "Life is a personal perpetual journey. As our paths go by, things change. The scenery, the weather, the path, the companions…\n\nAnd no matter what, we keep on journeying. Overcoming every obstacle, surviving every condition, welcoming and seeing companions off… \n\nBut how do we adapt so fast?\n\nWith patience, endurance, wits and the ability to balance what is being thrown at us. Just like a Bluejay.\n\nI give you BLUEJAY, may you find the qualities you need to walk your path in the most glorious way possible. Because you are capable of it.\n\n70x50 Acrylic\n\nCanvas will be sent to the address of the owner.",
