    "description": "Once I saw an angel. She appeared to me in Minsk, my hometown, which I so rarely visit. She was a mother, a hard-worker, a carer. She was like my own mom, like my sisters. She exercised her love the way she was taught too early. \n\n\"You're my angel\", a man says, and she smiles. In the backyard of their apartment building, with dozens more of angels living in, she spreads the wings.\n\nMay 3, 2015, 11:33.
