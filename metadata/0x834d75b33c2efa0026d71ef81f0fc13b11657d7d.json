    "description": "Life can knock us down many times, especially when we face problems that seem almost impossible to overcome. But that doesn’t mean we should give up, we should keep trying, and never be ashamed of failure. Instead, we should elevate it as the foundation of our wisdom. \n\nI believe we have the power to change our and other people’s lives. And in that case, life is not giving others a second chance, it’s us. \n\nAnd if we have that power, we should use it to give them the possibility of a new beginning, a better life, and redemption. \n\nLife will always give you a second chance, and when that happens, don’t waste it. Instead, let go of the past, forget about the things you cannot change, work on the things you can change, discover something new about you, and when you have that second chance in front of you, don’t give it a second thought, take it, and change your life forever.\n\nThis is my second chance, my genesis piece; Hope.\n\nMuch Love,\n\nMondo",
