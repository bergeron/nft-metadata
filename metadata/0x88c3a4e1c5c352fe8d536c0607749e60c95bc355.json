    "description": "Pat Lok and Party Pupils first met in Michigan in 2018, while they were both performing at Electric Forest. Hitting it off immediately - first with an online collab remix of a-ha - they went on to make several records together - 'From The Back,' 'I Want You', 'Alaska' and the future classic 'So Fine'.\n\n'Chief Ivory' is a mysterious, introspective electronic trip: a departure from the club-friendly sound they are mostly known for. The track samples a live IG jam by Grammy Award-winning pianist and producer Kiefer. Call this a Los Angeles super-collab if you will. Dive in and get lost.",
