    "description": "COALESCE # 01 (with light from the East) is the sculptural representation of the concept of merging, joining, becoming one.\n\nThe choice of these organic forms represents, according to the artist, the maximum expression of harmony and fluidity, also taking inspiration from the sculpted anatomies of the great masters of the Renaissance, such as Michelangelo and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n\nMirko Rotondi has a past as a photographer and printer at the time of the chemical dark room, and a vast photographic culture; one of his points of reference, from which he took inspiration and the masterful use of light and the Zonal System, are Edward Weston (to whom he pays homage with this work, inspired by Still Life Pepper # 30).\n\nThis image was modeled and rendered in 3D reaching high levels of photorealism using an Unbiased Render Engine.",
