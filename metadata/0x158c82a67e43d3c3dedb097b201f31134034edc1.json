    "description": "Spring, the beginning of the four seasons, is the main keyword of brightness and vitality. Therefore, the bookshelf was decorated with camellia flowers and cherry blossoms, which represent spring, and a rabbit, a dragon, and a snake, which correspond to spring, were placed like small dolls among the 12 zodiac animals.\nIt also explained its precious value with the symbol of peace and immutable, eternal love, jewelry, and diamond rings that match spring and filled Korean cloths with the blue color of spring among the five colors of the East. Materials containing auspicious meanings were placed with books to add a wish for happiness.\n",
