    "description": "After a big banquet sleep a while, as Elysium awaits in bliss ~ yet not too long and let not the frivolities of last night’s revelry spill over into the morning. For wicked weeds grow fastest in the day. In times of plenty, do not forget tomorrow. Laurence Fuller’s SuperRare Genesis.\n\nPoetry & AI Animation & Music & Produced & Performed by Laurence Fuller  \n@LaurenceFuller  \nwww.laurencefuller.art\n\n\nELYSIUM AWAITS IN BLISS\n\nMy Uncle was an antique dealer ~ on the edge of Paradise,  \nAnd that’s where he lived for his whole life.  \nA workshop filled with mechanisms,  \nNot art, nor science, nor religion, nor the learned scholars from the palace, could make of library ~ what he made from a single restoration.  \nA table full of pickled creatures,  \nCupboard of ancient elixirs,  \nCollectors from the far corners of Paradise,  \nLined up to see what was the latest from the alchemy of his study.\n\nOn the morning of 17th Birthday,  \nArrived the strangest parcel,  \nNever seen anything like it,  \nNot even from the basement of an ancient castle.  \nMy Uncle unwrapped it with the greatest care;  \n“Now this you must never tell”\n\nIt seemed as if it was a painting,  \nAnd yet it lived and moved, and swirled.  \nCreating itself, again and again and destroying and beginning every second anew.\n\nThe Masterpiece lived before our eyes,  \nIn the infinite pleasures of Paradise.  \nMy Uncle turned to me and said;\n\n“This was painted by the lord of the fauns.  \nThere are my boy the darkest secrets,  \nThat he would destroy all of Paradise,  \nTo keep in its’ shadows”\n\nFrom then on, everywhere it went, I followed.  \nYearning to know its’ secrets.  \nAnd in the earliest hours of dust and sunlight ~ The Masterpiece came to life.\n\nIt’s glimmer down the halls,  \nWoke me as the light bounced off the walls.  \nIn that cold night, my breathe a-steam,  \nMy pre-occupation with the pleasures of my dreams.  \nDissipated, by what I now see.\n\nPassing through a landscape,  \nThe painting now spoke to me.  \nMy heart was beating out my chest.\n\nUnto this last ~ the canvas stretched,  \nGothic bells that could be heard,  \nBetween the sweet sounds,  \nOf exotic birds.\n\nThe gardens of the most vibrant vines,  \nThe pride of all of Paradise,  \nThe Palace where the King resides.  \nThe gardens stretch for miles,  \nThe petals of every iris fell,  \nOnce bloomed in righteous hues.  \nBetween two statues; the entrance to the Palace.\n\nA King beloved by the people,  \nWas sheltered by the shadows of a crumbling steeple.\n\n“Paradise Reigns,  \nEcstasy for endless days,  \nRapture all our life,  \nFor the burning rose,  \nWe will sacrifice.\n\nParadise Reigns,  \nEcstasy for endless days,  \nRapture all our life,  \nFor the burning rose,  \nWe will sacrifice.”\n\nAnd yet seeping up the creek,  \nThe God of Pleasure had already taken his seat.  \nHis wicked calls, echoes down the halls.  \nDominion over the Kingdom,  \nAs pleasure dripped from the statues, chandeliers and candlesticks.\n\nThe riverbanks were choked with weeds and brambles, their tangled roots reaching out like grasping claws to ensnare.  \nSirens dripping wet with barnacles in their hair.\n\nDeviance in a house of lust,  \nTemple of sin,  \nFor the fallen King.  \nDebaucherous trance encompassed the people,  \nCaught in the grips of an avalanche,  \nOf power of madness,  \nHysteria in a blaze of pleasure,  \nGripped by the euphoria of devotion,  \nTo his Royal gaze.  \nWorship the ineffable days of endless glory ~ Paradise Reigns.\n\nAs he walks in the temple it shines with the light of the burning rose.  \nThe very air parts way to the divine.  \nThis is our hero,  \nThe flame that never dies,  \nA covenant of courage divine.\n\nOverlook the God of Pleasure’s revenge?  \nHere’s of course, where it ends.  \nFall to one’s own carnal fantasies,  \nWhere the seeds of war did flourish by the conquerer’s dreams.  \nSleeping while the wicked wind like weeds around the palace and all it sees.  \nPlant the seeds of sin,  \nAnd watch the corruption settle in.\n\nThe riverbanks were choked with weeds and brambles.  \nThey’re tangled roots reaching out like grasping claws to ensnare.  \nSirens dripping wet with barnacles in their hair.  \nCatfish darted from rotting wood to shelter.  \nFlowed through that black vein of the city.  \nWhere the King had wandered and made his bed among the miscreant and wayward.\n\nA cavern of shadows,  \nNow the parlor of a once great King,  \nLaying in the muck.  \nSurrounded by waste,  \nSlime and maggots consume the leavings in his haste.  \nDiscarded piles of pork,  \nRotting fruit, sour wine,  \nScavengers feeding off the remnants of life.  \nThis is where Paradise came to die.\n\nThe Temple’s shine was overrun,  \nAnd the worshipers bled an unholy sum.  \nThe heavens dropped and darkness clawed like moss.  \nOverrun with rot,  \nBlistered in the heart of the Palace, like a blood clot.\n\nWails and cries of their calamity;\n\nALL IS LOST!\n\nThe sky was full and grey,  \nThe clouds heavy, with the promise of rain.  \nExisting in a turgid state.  \nThe King looked up at the skies;\n\n“What has happened to Paradise?!”\n\nALL IS LOST!\n\nAs I look out, over the glowing mist,  \nA legion of heroes raise their fists,  \nChants to the fallen sun,  \nElysium awaits in bliss.  \n~ Laurence Fuller, 2023",
