    "description": "'Mid-Century Corvette' is one of my photographs from my Road Trip collection I exhibited in 2019.  \nThe scene was photographed on a quiet street somewhere in Palm Springs suburbia while exploring the area. \n\nThis is an Edition 1 of 1. \n\n\nMid-Century Corvette will never be minted or offered as an NFT again, you will be the sole owner of this NFT for your own personal use. Limited edition prints however will still be available for sale from my website.\n\nDimensions: 3000 x 1980 pixels @72dpi, jpg\nCopyright John Trif 2022 johntrif.com\n\n",
