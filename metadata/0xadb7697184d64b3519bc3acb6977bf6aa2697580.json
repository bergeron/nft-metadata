    "description": "\"Contact\" is a thought-provoking artwork.\n\n One hand is painted in black, representing the vast and infinite universe, while the other hand is painted in white, symbolizing the light and purity of the universe. The hands reaching out towards each other, is an attempt to bridge the gap between two opposing forces.\n\nThis artwork is a powerful reflection on the concept of connection and unity. Despite the contrasting colors of the hands, they are brought together in a harmonious and peaceful manner. This piece reminds us that no matter how different we may seem on the surface, we are all connected and part of the same universe.",
