    "description": "Dearly Beloved is a love song at the core. It sparked from a conversation with my girl about our lives and careers. In music and film, things can be sporadic. You never know where a job will take you where and when you find joy in the presence of another, the distance affects you. I wanted to write her/myself like an audio letter so that if we ever miss each other we could play it and have those mushy memories. \n\nI produced this track also playin guitar and bass. I recorded it punch-in style, which basically how iâ€™ve done everything for the past year and 2 months.",
