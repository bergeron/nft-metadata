You. Idk what to feel or even what to say sometimes \n\n\n\nYour funny but can get an attitude quicker then a snicker \n\n\n\nMaybe that’s why I call you sour patch. Because you never know which side which person your going to get \n\n\n\nThe naughty one who can make you smile even when your sour \n\n\n\nThe words who you talking to always seem to pop out of both our mouths\n\n\n\nMaybe I’m indecisive or maybe I just really don’t know what I want \n\n\n\nBut maybe just maybe I do know what I want \n\n\n\nBut I really just don’t know what I need in my life \n\n\n\nMaybe we’re sour but sour together as the sour patch kids we were meant to be \n\n\n\nMaybe I’m not cleaver or maybe I’m just judge mental \n\n\n\nBut shoot who’s going to stop me \n\n\n\nI’m just a girl",
