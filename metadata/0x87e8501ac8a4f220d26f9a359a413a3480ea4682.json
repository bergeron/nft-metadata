    "description": "Read the information before making a purchase!! Holozaki is a pfp,wallpaper,backgrounds project.  Start the Holozaki universe with a collection of Holo One 10,000 smiley devil avatars, which are not much different lol because 1 trait has 3 colors based on rarity.  This project started as a giveaway to people who own Neon Devil's 104. After that I will be hosting a free giveaway. for the general public (As much as I can afford the gas) and another 5,000 (or more) will sell for 0.104 Eth.  Copyright for Artist? You can redraw it or create a fanart. Then you can sell it without needing to buy my NFT, 40% of the proceeds go towards purchasing artist work and opening a gallery to showcase my purchased work. Read more at holozaki.com  This project took approximately 3 months to draw and was completed on December 6, 2021.  Thank you for supporting me and artis. I hope the person who owns it will like it because I put my best effort into drawing.",
