    "description": "Surreal Asian fusion landscape based on 5-year comparative search data for: „China”, „control”, „Meta” and „Metaverse”. These captions as well as the artwork’s title are encrypted in the calligraphy. Alongside them are name seals of the creator - Baiwei and the collector - Eloi. \n \nInspiration for the artwork comes from collector’s numerous years of life spent in China working in metaverse-oriented XR industry. His particular fondness of Baiwei’s style unfolded on the day of meeting with minister Li, after which Eloi was gifted a portrait of Sir William Johnson.",
