    "description": "This song is about my ex-girlfriends and how we broke up. And after I realized I didn't feel the same without her. And then I realized that she felt the same about me when I wasn't around her. But we feel different when we are apart. She was feeling the same because we belonged together. This inspired me to write the song.",
