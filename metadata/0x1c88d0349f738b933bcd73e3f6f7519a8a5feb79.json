    "description": "The voices in our heads speak doubtful things, yet they seem enchanting. I take a deep breath and continue to listen. I am unwavering since it's my world. Every step will remind you of the few mistakes you made in the face of a thousand victories, the universe moves in harmony with you. Reminding you that we are the masters of our worlds and must fight to retain that awareness. The struggle of being covered by the resin seems endless; It feels like we are left alone with it, at war with our own selves, in an eternal, dark night of the soul. We rise despite all of it.\n\nElevation\n19.5mb / 4000 x 6000",
