    "description": "Cutting his teeth as an urban street artist, prior to his emergence as a tour de force within the crypto art space, Eddie Gangland’s genre-defying work continues to make waves. “I've become a street artist of the metaverse,” observes Gangland wryly. With a prolific artistic practice, he tackles societal themes and current events within his work, which includes his career-defining “Gangland Skulls” NFT collection of unique skull artworks, sketches and collectable NFTs. Gangland has established himself at the forefront of the NFT space, collaborating with top tier brands including Supreme and Gap, as he expands his reach and artistic influence.    55/80",
