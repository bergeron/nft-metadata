    "description": "Woman enchained by patriarchy (snake/chain).\n\nFimmina (it stand for Female in Calabrian dialect) it's a digital artwork created for the theatre performance called \"Ammutati c'ha gi√† parrat'assai!\" ( Shut up, you have already talked too much!). This is a dialect sentence that men in the South of Italy have used against women for a very long time, and some of them still do. The performance included writings, songs and poems by women artists from different places and times. It refers to patriarchy, which is not over yet, and the damages it creates.  \nMy digital work has been projected during the show as a background and now lives only as an NFT. \n\n\nThis is my very first NFT in Limited Edition.\n\n\n734 x 939 px  \nDigital Illustration",
