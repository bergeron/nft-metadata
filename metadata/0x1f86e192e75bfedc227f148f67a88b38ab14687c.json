    "description": "King Kani loves to dance! But in the open sea, King Kani was always ridiculed for wasting his time dancing when most crabs would be spending time training to use their claws for fighting.  Tired of crabby attitudes, the King eventually decided to leave the sea and create his own tiny peaceful kingdom where he shows off his famous claw dance moves with his closest sea friends!",
