    "description": "**Coastal Waves**\n\nWhen I create my works I always use my memories and the feelings and emotions they bring me. Waves are one of the most fascinating phenomena created by nature, I think each of us had a moment in life when we just froze for a moment and could not take our eyes off of them. At different times of the day waves look very different, each time getting new shades, depending on the environment, the intensity of sunlight and weather. They can be calm or turbulent, or even just ripples on the water. We have no control over their color or behavior, all we can do is look at them. I hope this work will help you dive into your memories and recall those beautiful moments.\n\n[This work is intended for collectors of all three Chapters.](https://www.niftygateway.com/collections/coastalwaves)\n\nMade in p5js.\n\nFinal - 12700x8100",
