    "description": "Considered to be one of the urban indicators of Isfahan, Chehel Sotoun Palace is located next to Naqsh-e Jahan Square and in the neighborhood of Chahar Bagh. This garden along with its central glorious mansion are among the memories of Safavid rule in Isfahan. Many believe that adding 20 reflected columns in the water to the real columns of the palace is the appellation of Chehel Sotoun (forty columns). It was internationally inscribed by UNESCO as one of the characterized Persian gardens.",
