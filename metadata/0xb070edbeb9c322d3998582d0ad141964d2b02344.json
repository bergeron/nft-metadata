    "description": "25th february\nI have never felt so much fear before in my life.\n\nRecently I have lost my sister. I did not think there is grief that could be worse… it’s like some fucked up sur or arthouse. \n\nSuddenly you fall into darkness. And then like a lightning you are bashed onto the ground. Your limb gets teared off…and you are falling into darkness again. That lasts forever.\n\nYesterday I realized that worse exists. It’s like hundreds of sisters die every second.\nAnd to make it worse you feel guilt that you cannot stop that immediately right here and now.\nAnd you understand even if you throw your body on the tank it feels like you are cheating, looking for a fast way out…like it changes nothing, you did nothing.\nThese minutes, hours you regret you did not take that fucking iodine and did not read books about the art of war…\n\nI don’t believe in god and those who are alive don’t want to and do everything to stop all this. And why would god care?  He does not exist, end of story.\n\nI don’t believe",
