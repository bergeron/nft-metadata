    "description": "That morning I got up very early, it was still dark. The night before, the mountains were covered with snow clouds and a blizzard began. Putting on all the warm clothes, I went out of mountain house with a camera, hoping that the weather cleared up during the night and the mountain peaks became visible. The sky was cloudy and it was snowing lightly. The highest peaks were hidden by clouds. When it began to get light, the clouds began to dissipate. Closer to sunrise, it became almost clear, mountain peaks began to appear because of the clouds. Including the two-headed beautiful mountain Ushba. The sun had not yet emerged from behind the mountains, but the clouds in the sky were already burning. And as soon as the sun began to appear from behind the mountains, the mountain peaks began to be highlighted. The peaks of Ushba were illuminated so beautifully for just a few minutes. It was an unforgettable sight! Already half an hour after sunrise, the clouds again tightened all the peaks.",
