    "description": "Deranged is an artwork describing in visual form my first year of working creatively with the iconic David Bowie. The year is 1995. The interlinking images trace in detail the ideas, influences, philosophies and numerous experiments Bowie and I explored together. In essence they were the 'seedmother' of the final artworks created for the album 1-Outside. At the same time, they set the scene for many ideas and creative adventures yet to come. This artwork features several previously unseen notes and sketches, offering an intimate voyage into the process of creating with Bowie - the strange and often wild conversations and ideas translated into a matrix of visual representations. Deranged teleports the observer directly into a historic timeslice to reveal a realm filled with transforming personas, futuristic visions and spirit technologies.",
