    "description": "While returning from a dinner at a restaurant, I had to cross the road towards my car parking. When I turned towards right to see if any car is coming, I saw this decisive moment of the lady selling toys on the streets and the backlit that created like divine figure. Since I carry my camera always with me, I was able to capture this beautiful moment in a fraction of a second. \n\nThe colors, reflection and the posture of the lady in the backlit was so beautiful moment. It also shows the amount of responsibility the lady is carrying on her shoulders to look after her family that even at night she had to sell the toys to make some money for the day.",
