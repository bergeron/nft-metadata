    "description": "The first one is dedicated to you Wayne! You ended up inspiring the whole project. Grateful that we got to connect in this world as well as the Metaverse. Thank you for your passion, kindness, and voracious appetite for seeking out art/artists and adventures which created a rich and more electric life experience for you and inspired so many others! You lived many lifetimes in your short time here. You and your brilliant spirit live on. Hope you like this dude! ðŸ’¥ I am collaborating with musicians from all over the world. For this one my gifted cousin Isaac Kaplan executed perfectly what I wanted. To thread together Wayneâ€™s iconic sound bites ( and parts from the podcast Wayne asked me to do with him ) along with a Massive Attack like Vibe. Isaac you nailed it! This collaboration is a special one.",
