    "description": "#1\nWe live in an overly busy and cluttered world, minimal art can be a reminder to focus on what truly matters. I enjoy the challenge of working within the constraints of existing architecture and elements, as well as the opportunity to transform the urban's complex nature down to its essential elements. I create a unique perspective of the city and express it in my own vision by simplifying the urban landscape and highlighting its geometric shapes and lines.\n\nSoftware used : Photoshop\nSize : 4000 X 5000",
