    "description": "Fuck it. He did it again!\n\nBack in the early days of BAYC, Jimmy the Monkey was a known notorious character. He had a reputation for stealing valuable items, including a ledger.\n\nOn one side You've got this cool club for all these apes, people havin a good, doing dope shit. On the other side there's this dickhead Jimmy stealing Shit.\n\nFast forward into the story : Jimmy woke up in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea and with an empty roll of toilet paper.\n\nAs he was feeling suffocated from his own foul odor due to the after effect of his neuclear farts.\n\nIn the quiet moments, he realized that everyone outside had left the bathroom thinking he is still unconcious.\n\nTaking advantage of the situation, Jimmy snuck out of the bathroom in search of a new roll of toilet paper.\n\nHe saw Curtis and other apes were busy scuba divin through a nasty sewer, While Gary was occupied with studying the mysterious box and monitoring deez Monke's dash in the sewer. Jimmy stumbled upon a secret box labeled Confidential by Summoning Circle.\n\nWith no one paying attention, this bastard grabbed the box and fled back to the safety of the bathroom, locking himself in once again.\n\nRest of the story continued on twitter…\n\nI forgot to mention i am high asf rn... Anyways : Unleash the unexpected from this Dickhead Jimmy… On Feb 15th. Apes together strong ",
