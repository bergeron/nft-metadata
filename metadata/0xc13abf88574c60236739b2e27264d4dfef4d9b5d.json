    "description": "Censored Dreams is a blend of timelines, a glitch pop expression of how our dreams are changing as we emerge. A child's birth, an angel, before he understands how beautiful the world is he is blinded by the toxic future he breathes within.\n\nGovernments & organizations, social media n television, mobile phones & digital pads consume the innocence, preparing you to be ready to enter a darker reality.\n\nThere was a world alive beyond the screens we live in now. Knowledge was superior to information. The beauty of forests, playing in the fields, the scorching sun, and drinking from the deep blue seas are somewhat tales that we now tell.\n\nOur existence shall become cybernetic purely within the times to come. The future that we somewhat dreamed of has arrived but little did we know that our freedom will be in the hands of corporations yet we will choose to be free within our minds breathing within virtual worlds..",
