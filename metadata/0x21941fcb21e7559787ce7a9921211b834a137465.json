    "description": "I would like to thank 0xTjo for making this possible with their deeply emotive BLeU backgrounds that have been a staple of their recent works. This is the first experiment of exploration featuring the Nonsters. They have always been very polished and presented through a specific creative lens that made them feel like toys or statues but here I have began tearing away at the virtual flesh of my four eyed friends to create new works of art. It's sort of a style of collage; I make the elements myself by hand and arrange, modify and warp them until it feels right. I look forward to more meaningful exploration and arrangement of interrelated characters that share a similar theme or motif. There's a lot that can be conveyed through imaginary friends, especially when they work together in harmony.  I felt extremely compelled to put my characters into a new environment and now I want to do it more and more with different artists who work in different mediums more than ever. I want to explore the push and pull between different elements to make things people have never seen before. I love this piece, and I'm incredibly grateful to be sharing it with you all. Thank you.",
