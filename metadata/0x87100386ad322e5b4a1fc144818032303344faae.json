Yes, the EL Nido Island in Philippines is amazing but the best part of this picture is the clouds naturally formed like the PHILIPPINE MAP.  I went up to the cliff to photograph the overlooking paradise, then suddenly I noticed that the clouds in front of me naturally formed like the Philippine Map. This is one of a kind experience you can't miss!\n\nEL Nido, Itâ€™s known for the white sand beaches, coral reefs and as the gateway to the Bacuit archipelago, a group of islands with steep karst cliffs. One of EL Nido Island called Matinloc Shrine, This is a spiritual oasis that houses the Shrine of Our Lady of Matinloc and provides a beautiful view of the jagged cliffs overlooking a crescent-shaped cove.
