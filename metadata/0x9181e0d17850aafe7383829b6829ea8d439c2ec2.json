    "description": "Sometimes we can’t use only mind. We try to make a decision calmly, but we can’t. We are disturbed by our feelings. Feelings control us and conquer the mind. After that we suffer and can’t understand how is it possible? How could I do it? Reason is your mind has been turned off.\nThis creature has found the solution to this problem. She can liberate her mind and let her feelings fly away. After this process her mind is absolutely clear. But there is one condition. She should do it on a full moon night.",
