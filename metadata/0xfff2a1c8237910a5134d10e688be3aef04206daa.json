    "description": "In the shadows of my mind\nA flicker of light has died\nAn ember that once burned bright\nNow fades into the night\n\nBurnout, a beast that lingers\nA weight that only grows\nIt feeds on all that's good and pure\nAnd leaves a gaping hole\n\nI see myself, a puppeteer's toy\nControlled by hands unknown\nI dance and spin to a tune so dark\nAs the strings cut through my soul\n\nThe world around me twists and turns\nIn a kaleidoscope of pain\nA labyrinth of broken dreams\nWhere hope has long been slain\n\nYet in this darkness, there's a spark\nA glimmer of something new\nA hope that I can rise again\nAnd start my life anew\n\nSo I gather up the broken pieces\nAnd put them back in place\nI rebuild what's been torn apart\nAnd find a way to face\n\nThe burnout beast that once consumed\nIs now a thing of the past\nI'm stronger now, I've found my way\nAnd the darkness cannot last.",
