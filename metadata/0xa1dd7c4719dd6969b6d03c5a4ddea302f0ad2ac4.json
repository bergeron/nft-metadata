    "description": "Our modern lives are constantly leaving behind data and digital fingerprints stored and reused in large databases of cloud providers. \n\n\nThe continuous, all-encompassing evaluation of these huge amounts of data and their use for commercial purposes subsequently influences our lives. Be it information gathering via news channels, online shopping or dating platforms.\n\n \n\nStudio LX2SH, however, does not deal with the legitimate question of data sovereignty and who has the right to reuse this data, but with corrupted data that cannot be read under normal circumstances. This data lies in the cloud with no further benefit to humanity. The series \"recycling broken files\" takes these damaged data sets and transforms them into digital art.",
