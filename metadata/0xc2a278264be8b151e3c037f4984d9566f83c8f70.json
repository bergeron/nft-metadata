    "description": "Artwork by Hulki Okan Tabak, 30 Editions, Minted on Heart of a Dog smart contract, 2022\n\nSharik is an experimental homage to the writer Mikhail Bulgaov. In the novella Heart of a Dog, Sharik is the street dog operated on by the Professor.\n\nHeart of a Dog has been interpreted both as a satire on Bolshevism and as a criticism of eugenics. One commonly accepted interpretation is that Bulgakov was trying to show all the inconsistencies of the system in which Sharikov, a man with a dog's intelligence, could become an important part. Sharik is seen as \"a reincarnation of the repellent proletarian\", and the professor represents a \"hyperbolic vision of the bourgeois dream\", according to J. A. E. Curtis. (wikipedia)",
