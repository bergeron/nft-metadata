    "description": "A collection taken with a medium format camera. The room is pitch black and lit with orange light. The atmosphere of the photo changes depending on how the light is applied, so some tips are needed.\n\nThis photo is intentionally blurred, but this blur expresses my personality. Also, it is difficult to adjust this degree of blurring. Nowadays, many people can easily hold a camera and take beautiful pictures. One of the issues is how to differentiate photographers. I created this work because I thought it was more valuable to take a photo that was intentionally out of focus than a photo that was in focus.\n\n(8256Ã—5504 pixels)",
