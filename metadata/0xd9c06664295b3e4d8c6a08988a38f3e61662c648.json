    "description": "For years I have driven up the I-5 freeway in San Diego and admired the seemingly random, stark white, castle like building looming ever present over the passing cars.  Every time I found myself passing by I always told myself \"I need to capture that magic one day\".  Too often do we let that 'One Day' linger on the horizon, never reaching out to grasp what is so close.  I no longer have room for that in my life so after 10 years, I finally set out to capture the magic in this moment for all to experience.  \n\nGifted with the perfect sunrise and a bit of luck, I finally feel I have achieved this goal and am honored to present to you \n\n\"California Castle\"  \nby TheShutterPrince",
