    "description": "Sometimes I look at this photo and I start crying because you're so far away. I see myself in your eyes. I miss you. Even though today you're still here, I know there will be a time when you won't be here anymore and it breaks my whole heart. I love you grandma. I loved you from the moment I met you. I spent my first New Years asleep by your side. I grew up in your house on the weekends. Until one day a border kept us apart. \n\nI'm here now in another country just trying to make you proud. I feel you in my heart. I wear the bracelet and necklace you gave me everywhere I go. I have all the best parts of you. Your DNA is my DNA.\n\nThank you for being my motivation.\nThank you for your love and for believing in me. \nI will love you today, tomorrow, and forever. ",
