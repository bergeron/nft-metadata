    "description": "I wish to connect, sound, words, movement, and motion. Every piece in this collection will include a poem that is in some way integrated into the piece.\n\n\nCut down men sing in finite quantities, exploring where their passions went. Measuring miss calculated properties, they wonder where their dreams were sent. I sit still and hear breezes succumb to induced comas, spitting up what they thought they had, thought they were, and thought they wished to be. This is a message for those who float on soft subway breezes, who’s footsteps sing out and welcome long walks to bus stops. Cracked faces and murmured breath, cramped spaces bereft of depth pushed in and taught to think there’s nothing left. The cold cures all wounds it pulls out what’s in to show the rest, and when it’s done it’s done it’s best. My Bewildered eyes say nothing less. \n\nMovement: Larkin Poynton\nMusic: Larkin Poynton\nPoem: Larkin Poynton",
