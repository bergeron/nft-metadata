    "name": "Sophia Tolstaya #1/5",
    "description": "Sophia, at just 16 years old, embarked on a life full of love and adventure when she married the legendary writer Leo Tolstoy. With her sharp mind and unwavering spirit, Sophia quickly took on the role of not only a loving wife and mother of 13, but also as a pivotal figure in Tolstoy's literary success.\n\nHer passion for capturing life's moments led her to pick up a camera and document her life, including her life with Tolstoy, resulting in over 1,000 beautiful photographs that tell her story. Sophia's thirst for knowledge and self-expression was further highlighted in her memoirs, titled \"My Life\".\n\nWith a sharp eye for detail, Sophia was more than just a wife and mother; she served as Tolstoy's literary assistant, lending her skills as a translator, transcriber, and editor. Sophia's contributions to Tolstoy's works and her tireless support of his career earned her a place in history as a vital member of the Tolstoy legacy.\n\nHer life was full of love, joy, and purpose, and she lived every day to the fullest. Sadly, Sophia passed away at the age of 75, but her legacy continues to inspire generations to come.",
