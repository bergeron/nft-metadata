Aino doesn't really care about the food as long as Noki's there. 😊💖\n\nThey've been walking around the town for hours, looking for good food and enjoying each other company. It's most likely past their break time already. 😱⌚\n\nI wonder what they end up getting for lunch (or dinner)?\n\n---\n\n1250 x 2500 MP4",
