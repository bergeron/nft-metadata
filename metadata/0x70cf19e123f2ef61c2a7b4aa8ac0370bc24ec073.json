    "description": "This work proposes a dynamic tension between our three dimensional bodies and the two dimensional virtual image (dematerialized). This series uses downloaded avatars, stop-motion clay animation, and CGI to explore ecstatic states of change of our digital selves, not in a linear direction, but out in all directions, in favor of multiplicity and illegitimacy.",
