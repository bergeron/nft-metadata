    "description": "When we are small, our ideas about life are very small, we learn from examples that have been given to us since childhood. We assemble a dollhouse made for us to have a better idea of it, as well as of life in general. Growing up, these limits and limitations of our ideas became small and cramped for us. And those who are content with limits remain limited: limited are joys, delights, silence, existence. If you still cutting patterns: maybe you are stuck in a dollhouse?\n\nShot on 35mm",
