    "description": "I’m Finn Matthews, I live in LA and I write and produce all of my music out of my home studio. This song is inspired by that dreamy feeling you get when you first start chilling with someone you really vibe with. The song flows like a freestyle and never gives you too much to latch onto, which gives the feeling of falling, surrounding control and letting the experience take you on its own journey. I wanted the production to feel like a modern D’angelo groove, then I combined that with spacey pianos and live bass and it all just came to life.",
