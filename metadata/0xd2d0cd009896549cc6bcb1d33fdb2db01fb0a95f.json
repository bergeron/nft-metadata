    "description": "Intoxicated with the joy of newfound freedom and drunk on exaltation, Icarus flew. He was a mortal, yet in that moment, with the world unfurling beneath him in all its wondrous glory, he felt like an Olympian God. He revelled in the embrace of the fleecy clouds, and floated in the soft blue interludes between them, like a leaf in a still pond.",
