    "description": "For countless years, I have chased the aurora and its spiritual like existence within the night sky. During each memorable occurrence, for a brief moment, I feel a sense of knowing and inexplicable truth. Almost like a powerful interconnection between past, present and future self. There is much to be learned from within underneath this beautiful symphony of light and colour.  Look up and listen.  \n\nIn a life that is moving at warp speed, there are few moments that can stop the world in its tracks.  The aurora captivates, mesmerizes and emotionally moves me more than any other experience on earth. And so I dedicate the chase to this natural phenomena time and time again. Whether near or far, this is where you'll always find me.\n\nCapturing the aurora was what sparked my love and passion for photography, therefore it only made sense to start my journey on Super Rare from the beginning. An image created from the Vestrahorn in South-East Iceland.",
