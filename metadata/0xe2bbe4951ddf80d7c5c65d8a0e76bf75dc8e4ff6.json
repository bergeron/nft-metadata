    "description": "Issue #1 of Fleishigs Magazine, pickled in brine for digital posterity.\n\nHalf sour, fully kosher. \n\n__\n\n\nWe’re making each issue of Fleishigs into a 1/1 NFT that will be your key to a whole new world (and bragging rights at your Kiddush club).\n\nThe first eleven unique Fleishigs tokens will be dropped one at a time. Each one will grant you access to members-only benefits like a lifetime subscription to Fleishigs Magazine, VIP access to live-cooking demos, cookbook release parties, and maybe even access to behind-the-scenes photo shoots where you’ll help “clean up” the leftovers, with new extras being added as we go.\n\n__\n\nHandcrafted in collaboration with @popandsicle \n",
