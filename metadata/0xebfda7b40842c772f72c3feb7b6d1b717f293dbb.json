    "name": "Reflection In The Universe",
    "description": "Reflection;\nThe confusion, disorder and chaos we are in, together with the reversal of the universe, creates an order with the reflection created by the water, as if a tiny touch of water will disrupt the order and cause it to disperse, isn't it? This is why we are caught in the breathless flow of life, insensitive to the environment, blind to beauties, and offended by ourselves. However, just like in this photo, if a small angle reflected in the water suddenly changes our perspective and fills us with peace, wouldn't a small perspective we create in ourselves beautify our whole world?",
