    "description": "This is Pepe's oldest documentation in history, a piece of art from the 15th century by none other than the master Leonardo da Vinci himself. Originally it was thought to have been lost forever. This particular piece of art seems to be the master's first attempt at what we know today as the \"Vitruvian Man\". Also this proves that Pepe existed even before we thought. Skeptics will say this isn't true but there's also the seal at the bottom of the page to prove you wrong and the blockchain transaction which cannot be faked.",
