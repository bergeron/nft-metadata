    "description": "The Sharaf satellite is evidence of a previously unseen, fractal space system in which the satellite, being in orbit A0 - 3, the closest exoplanet to the NOVA III star, also has its own satellite with a satellite. These space objects are connected not only by gravity, but by heating each other they support internal thermonuclear reactions. In fact, this is a system of stars one in orbit of the other.",
