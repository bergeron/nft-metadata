    "description": "## What is a plug?\n\n A Plug is a connector. A Plug gets things done. A Plug sources and supplies hard-to-find items and links you to those you need to know, whether its for a work connection, concert tickets, or some high-grade medicinal refreshment.\n\n\n\n ## The Plug\n\n LOGIK becomes The Plug to those who hold this NFT, which is programmed to provide increasing benefits (juice) the longer it is held. The juice meter level increases every 60 days while the NFT remains under continuous ownership in your wallet. As the juice meter progressively increases from zero to 100%, the owner will be entitled to event invitations and airdrops of other NFTs from dope artists in the space. If you ever trade or sell the Plug, the juice meter will revert to 0% juice and the process restarts for the next owner. (Trading or selling The Plug will not affect the airdrops you have already received.)\n\n\n\n If The Plug reaches The Alchemist level, the juice will be transferred in full to the next collector.",
