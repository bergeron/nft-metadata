    "description": "Story behind the artwork:\n\nMy personal interpretation of Norway. Painterly mountain landscape. Layers upon layers. Creating depth while keeping it as dreamy and painting-like as I have in my mind.\n\nWhat stands out are the striking yellow houses, which for me have something magical about them. It seems as if they were color-coordinated with the scenery. Color harmony at its finest. \n\nThe first collector gets the Original uncompressed TIFF and Original JPG files on request.\n\nEdition 1/1\n3293 x 4117 px / 300dpi\nArtist: Kathrin Federer\n\nValid Copyright and License: CC-ND-SA\n\n",
