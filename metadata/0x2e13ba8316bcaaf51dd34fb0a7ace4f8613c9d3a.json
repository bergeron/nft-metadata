    "description": "Life is a war going on with us from the beginning to the end. It is like the game or the play going on in which we all are performing our character's role. It is not like we have left our role and sitting in a corner to see the spectacle. We have to fulfill our role, if we don't fulfill it we will be rejected. This is the feature of the play that you are the hero, the villain or the character dancing behind, all the roles are in your hands and remember that this movie is yours and do not give much importance to anyone in this that you can get out of your own movie. If a lot is not in your hands but a lot is in your hands. It is in your hands to help anyone, to be healthy, to eat well. You hve your taste of tongue, your sensations in your hands. You have all that things in your hands which would have ever done by a great person. You can get examples of everything from poverty to affluence. Just don't sit still, the end is to rest. Get knowledge and share,the universe  is in your hands. ",
