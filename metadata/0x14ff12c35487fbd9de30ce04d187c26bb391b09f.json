    "description": "/The human mind is captured by everything except their own life. Everything controls them.\n\nHumans are accustomed to the idea that they need to be happy and aspire to their own happiness. Addictions and temtations give illusion of it. The side effect of happiness it’s an anxiety and depression because they don’t have smh or can’t do smh. That's why they want to make themselves happier as possible. Vicious circle.\n\n\nMusic by: Nctrnm - Parade",
