    "description": "Streets and houses,\nThey are neither there nor they are not.\nA peaceful calm, where I can restart.\nLighter, with no need to possess or own,\nJust to share, to appreciate, to be known.\n\nNo questions to ask, no answers to seek,\nOnly a longing for a coolness so sleek.\n\nBut...\nCan silence turn into darkness where a shadow and a thin silhouette can fill the wine glass?\n\nWe are united in our humanity and we are reminded that we are not alone. \nGetting lighter as we get heavier since a drop of blood and tear could be heavier and colorless than the oceans. \nOur souls, our eyes and our existence, would be burned in a second, with a single flare of sun.\nBut we choose to be immortal, while the trees are sleeping eternally, where the nightingales can sing and fly.\n",
