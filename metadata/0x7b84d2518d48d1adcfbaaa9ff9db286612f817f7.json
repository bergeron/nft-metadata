For this purpose, I chose a kind of doe that migrates a lot.\nSarah has recently gotten married\nAt this age she should subsequently have thousands of wishes, but fear and anxiety replace wishes. Because she has to leave her hometown in order to have a better future, she also has to start a new marriage life too. These events may seem difficult to a young girl in her early young age. She is hesitant. She does not know whether she made the right decision or not!\nSize: 24/3 MG\nwidth: 1490\nHeight: 2500",
