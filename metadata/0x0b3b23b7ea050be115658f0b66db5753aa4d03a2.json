    "name": "Paradise Lost",
    "description": "Each frame is specially layered to take you on a journey of 'Paradise lost'. The top frame starts as the heavenly skies above us, with each frame gradually descending towards Dante's inferno. \n\nThe unorthodox design allows you to closely observe the finer details, scanning the piece frame by frame. This lets you truly immerse yourself in the journey, as you make your descent from Paradise to Inferno. An emphasis on the intricate details and effort that went into creating each layer of this artwork has the desired effect of enriching your overall experience of the piece. \n",
