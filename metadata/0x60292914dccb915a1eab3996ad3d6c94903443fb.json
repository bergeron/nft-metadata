    "description": "A glimpse of my great-grandmother who stopped by in my memory as I recall her presence in a portrait while her presence of youth shines in front of my eyes. \n\nMy great-grandmother left the mortal realm at the age of 99, and as I remember, I always saw her when time wrapped around her body like a shroud of age. Later she started to forget my name, but her blessings were always pure. \n\nThis piece is an AI portrait to bring her presence alive and was created with the help of my father. My father helped me visualize her personality. ",
