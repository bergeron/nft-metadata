    "description": "The message of this chilled Fake Meme is clear: DOPEPE doesn’t need to cope anything. Also, he doesn’t need hope for the future. All he needs is a big joint to smoke, as he is dope.\n\nDOPEPE combines the famous DANK PEPE card with Punk6529 COPEPE: \n\nDOPEPE and COPEPE both are a homage to the artwork Hope. Instead of Hope or Cope, Dopepe chills and smokes some straight dope. \n\nThe colors yellow, Pepe green, red and black are a subtle representation of the colors of the Jamaican flag. As an obvious reference to the amazing Dank Pepe, his original Joint, Sunglasses and Background are used in the way of a collage and enrich the typical print style of Hope. Also the issuance (420) of course is inspired by Dank Pepe.",
