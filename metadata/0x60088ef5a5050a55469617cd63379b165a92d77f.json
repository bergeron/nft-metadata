    "description": "I made this song with Tate Gardner on a day that we were just not feeling it. Even though both our heads were elsewhere, we knew that if we just sat down and got started, the energy would immediately shift because we were doing what we love to do. \n\nThere are days where it's just hard, but through personal experience I have found that when you overcome the resistance, all of your manifestations and new opportunities start flooding in. I am grateful for the process because it is what makes me feel alive. \nSometimes you really just gotta show up!\n\nI connected with Ayotemi in April and fell in love with his music. I had just made the song and immediately had a gut feeling that he needed to be on this track. The collaboration flowed like water and just like that we created a song together. \n\nEver since, Ayotemi and I share a special friendship where we talk about astral projecting and send each other 4 minute voice memos explaining crazy dreams from the night before. It's pretty rad to collaborate with someone who you resonate with spiritually. We align on our values and mission as artists. I believe in his vision and art, so it is so wonderful to share this experience together with the web3 community.\n\nYou have purpose. You are capable. You are meant to follow what you are passionate about.\n\nShow up!\n\nPerformed by TAROT & Ayotemi\nWritten by Jordyn Benedict & Ayotemi\nProduced by Tate Gardner\nMixed/Mastered by Nic Laz\nCover art by TAROT",
