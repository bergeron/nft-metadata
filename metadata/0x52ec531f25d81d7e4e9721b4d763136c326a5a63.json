    "name": "The Twins",
    "description": "The art piece talks about the dual nature of Gemini. In Babylonian astronomy, the stars Castor and Pollux\nwere known as the Great Twins. The Twins were regarded as minor gods and were called Meshlamtaea and Lugalirra, meaning respectively 'The One who has arisen from the Underworld' and the 'Mighty King'. The twins here however express the polarities; light and dark, negative and positive. Here even though one comes from darkness, it has its own strength. She harnesses the power of the masculine principal and the other from the feminine principle. The art depicts the balance of the Divine masculine and Divine feminine in harmony and union.\n\nThe art is channeled from my visions during meditation when I was going through a healing process to achieve inner union of my own masculine and feminine aspects. The feminine energy is responsible for birthing and creating ideas and desires while the masculine energy is action oriented. ",
