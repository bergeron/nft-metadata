    "description": "A sheet of large format film is exposed to the sunlight my son was born into. That negative is then folded and placed in a tank of chemicals, liquefying the layers of red, green and blue which make up that record of white white. Light is passed through the tank and this moment is recorded on a new sheet of film.\n\nRepeated over time, this process shifts the original record of light (like raw data), into a record of accumulated time as additive color (like information). The sheet of film is destroyed in the process, but it is first scanned becoming a 1/1 NFT.\n\nThis is an experiment in representing a past moment rearticulated in the present in an ongoing way. It is part of my obsession with how we deal with the past in creating our histories and identities and builds upon my previous work 'September 20'.",
