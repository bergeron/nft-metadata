    "description": "Green version\n*\nFinding myself, again, in awe of movement. My body begs to learn presence, to release the internal butterflies, to find peace through extremities of your own physicality. \n\nI never liked when my body felt like a butterfly. \nSo I killed the butterflies. All of them. At least I thought. \n\nThe many forms of movement vary by perspective. And to question perspective is, well, to question the mere meaning of a body in space. For, what can ‘movement’ mean, if we’re bound to the earth like the butterflies to my stomach. \n\nDoes my movement require respite?\nOr will the butterflies take over again?\n\nLost in movement, I’ll forget it all — my own thoughts six feet behind form. \n*",
