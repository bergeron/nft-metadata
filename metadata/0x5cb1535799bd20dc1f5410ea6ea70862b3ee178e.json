    "description": "Am I dreaming!  Am I awake!  I see the past or the future… Everything is vague… Everything is dark… Everything is fragile… Houses … Buildings … Human… Intertwined strands… \n\nShapes made of strands as if they are exist or not. As if they appear for a moment and vanish in a blink of an eye. All the strands together form an image, image Of me, Of you, Of us… Of my city, Of your city, Of our city and of our world.\n\nAll of us with intertwined strands are connected in dreams. Why we are not seeing these strands in reality, Why are we so apart, Why we are not together.\n\nSo, Are we dreaming? Are we awake ?\nDo we see the past or do we see the future?\n\nAre these dreams happened in the past… or these dreams will happen in the future…",
