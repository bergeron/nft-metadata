    "description": "Art is a form of creation that allows me to transcend or reinterpret reality, and to create unique universes that capture the imagination of an individual. \n\nI also like to think that Art can be an emotional language, allowing an artist to express his own feelings, or allowing an audience to share and feel a particular emotion.\n\nI made this work to express some things that I feel deep inside me and that I don't want to talk about. \nOf course, I let you interpret this creation as you wish.\n\nEnjoy 👽\n",
