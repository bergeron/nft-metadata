    "description": "The Goddess creates life to avoid the spread of darkness. Imagination dominates reality.\nWhen everything is empty, dark and silent, we must do what the Creator did. Out of nothingness comes light and life. We are made to fill the voids and immerse ourselves in our\ndigital worlds. We have become numb due to the constant impact of reality, we have gone beyond this life and plunged into our own simulations. When there is a departure from\nreality to virtual reality, then a new person is born through the genome.\n\nCreated by:\nKsujen x SpurlinCinema\n",
