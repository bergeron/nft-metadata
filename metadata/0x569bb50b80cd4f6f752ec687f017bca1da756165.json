    "description": "On a chillingly dark winter day, Caesar, aged thirty, ventured to a museum. As he walked through the gloomy galleries, a sense of unease crept over him, as if he was being pulled towards a hidden truth.   \n \nHe suddenly stopped in front of an ancient Greek relic. His eyes were immediately drawn to the mystic bust behind the thick glass box. Only inches from his head, he read the words that were inscribed upon it: \"Alexander III, King of Macedonia, Pharaoh of Egypt, King of Persia, Hegemon of the Hellenic League\".   \n \nStruck by the thought that this man had achieved the impossible at the same age, Caesar was determined to uncover the power that turned Alexander III into an Overman. He stared into the eyes of the sculpture, almost as if he was speaking directly to Alexander himself, and exclaimed, \"How is it possible that your legacy has survived through time and civilizations? How did you achieve what no one else has? How did you become an Overman?!\"   \n \nWith his voice echoing in the empty gallery, Caesar began the first day of the rest of his life.",
