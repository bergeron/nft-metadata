    "description": "I had a dream about a green girl that was half spider, so I drew a green girl that is half spider. \n\nThis was a fun piece to make because I was able to explore a new realm of art that I haven't tried before. Pixelated animation is definitely a fun new venture for me and I can't wait to see the impact it has on my creativity. \n\nThanks for lending me your eyes for a moment, lol.  ",
