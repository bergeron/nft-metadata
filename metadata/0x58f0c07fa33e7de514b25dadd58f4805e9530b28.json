    "description": "The Brown Series is a series of encaustic paintings created by Reuben Sinha.  Combining inspiration from his own experiences and those of his beloved friends and family, Reuben carefully captures the emotions, culture, and visual of those with brown skin. Here we see the exploration of brown, the aim to understand it as it relates to the beautiful souls that occupy its company.  The Brown Series is Reuben Sinha's testament to creating work that builds its own reference to Brown, one where we see it for all of its beauty, its complications, and its purpose.",
