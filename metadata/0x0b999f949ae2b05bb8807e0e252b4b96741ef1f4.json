    "description": "This image was created with the dried remains of Aberlour Alba after enjoying a dram of this wonderful Scotch Whisky.  After the last drop has been consumed, there is enough residue to create these otherworldly patterns at the bottom of the glass.\n\nFor over 15 years, I have been creating the images that comprise the Vanishing Spirits portfolio.  The Art of Whisky is an official book of these images that will be released in May 2022 through Chronicle Books.  In celebration of that book release, I am releasing some of these images as 1/1 NFTs.  Slainte.  ",
