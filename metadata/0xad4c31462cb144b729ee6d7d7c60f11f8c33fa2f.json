    "description": "This is my genesis Sound drop, and the web3 debut of Catch Me.\n\nThe collector with the most editions at the end of public sale will receive:\n- two (2) limited-edition, die-cut yadzi stickers mailed to you\n- two (2) tickets to my upcoming show at the Viper Room Lounge in LA\n- access to locked channels with exclusive content on the 'Into Our Hands' discord server\n\nABOUT 'CATCH ME'\nI wrote this song at the height of the pandemic. I’d just moved across the country to LA a few months earlier, and I felt caught between the anxieties of my internal and external worlds. As I searched for my sense of self in a new and unfamiliar place, I felt more lost than I ever had before. I was falling apart, wishing I could just go back to a simpler time in my life - relive it, appreciate how good it was to not feel fear every day.\n\nFlash forward to now: my emotional wounds have turned to scars. And with that healing, this song has transformed in my eyes from a lament into an anthem - a celebration of my personal perseverance, and our collective perseverance having made it thru the worst of the pandemic.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled with anxiety, self-doubt, and/or hopelessness, then this song is for you. I hope listening to it helps release a bit of your existential tension as you dance, head-bang, sing at the top of your lungs, or preferably all of the above.\n\nCatch Me is track #2 on my debut EP ‘Into Our Hands’. Huge thanks to the amazing cohort of contributors to the Into Our Hands collaborative crowdfund campaign - you all helped make this drop possible!! Special shout out to contributor Madmann.eth, who’s hand photo is featured in the golden egg artwork.\n\nCheck out the music video for Catch Me (directed & edited by yours truly): https://youtu.be/uJ26hbAFaio\n\n\nWritten by yadzi\nProduced by yadzi + Zach Parker\nMastered by Conor Dalton\n\nArt by yadzi\nGolden Egg Art by yadzi + Madmann.eth",

Is that a lie?\nI been waiting for a spark in the dark\nBut the fire won’t start and the sun don’t rise\nYeah the sun don’t rise\nWish I could fly\nRight back where it all began\nNineteen, we were fucking in the back of the van\nCarefree, blowing trees I was making plans\nWhole world like a gun in the palm of my hand, oh\nBut now we’re lying on the bed\nAfter everything we said\nBoth trying so hard not to be the one to cry\n\nI don’t wanna waste your time\nIt’s just the harder I try\nThe more I fuck up my life\nCuz all that I seem to find\nAre all the demons inside\n(I think they’re getting out)\n\nHelp me I’m searching for my head\nLost it a while back when I left\nLook to the stars, hold out your arms\nCatch me I’m falling, falling apart\n\nHelp me I’m searching for my soul\nIt’s just like me, but made of gold\nLook to the stars, hold out your arms\nCatch me I’m falling, falling apart\n\n(interlude)\n(Falling apart)\n\nWhen I told you there was nothing on my mind\nIt was a lie, it was a lie\nI been holding my tongue from the jump\nImma give it all up and let it fly\nI’m on my last life baby\n\nCuz I try to put it into words\nBut you act like you only heard\nThe one thing that I said\nThat made you pissed and now I’m picking up\nThe pieces of myself that I can’t tell are mine or yours\nBut no it’s fine, we’ll just move on, there’s nothing wrong\nSo there’s no reason to cry\n\nI don’t wanna waste your time\nIt’s just the harder I try\nThe more I fuck up my life\nCuz all that I seem to find\nAre all the demons inside\n(I think they’re getting out)\n\nHelp me I’m searching for my head\nLost it a while back when I left\nLook to the stars, hold out your arms\nCatch me I’m falling, falling apart\n\nHelp me I’m searching for my soul\nIt’s just like me, but made of gold\nLook to the stars, hold out your arms\nCatch me I’m falling, falling apart\n\nFalling apart",
