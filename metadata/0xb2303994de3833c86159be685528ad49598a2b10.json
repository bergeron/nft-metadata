    "description": "A boldly unique original hand-drawn digital art piece depicting the life story of the city of Los Angeles (v1). \n\nLaid out as a chronological timeline telling the history of the city through a series of whacky, larger-than-life illustrations. Anyone who loves this crazy, chaotic Southern California city will recognize the important moments of history depicted throughout.\n\nSince Sagen.Life focuses on telling life stories, key years can be seen on or next to each iconic landmark, location, or moment in the city's history from 1850 to the present day. \n\nIdeal for collectors of one-of-a-kind Los Angeles memorabilia or anyone interested in leveraging the piece as a business opportunity. Owning this special piece will allow you to sell prints at scale to both B2B (museums, airports, government buildings, cultural centers) and B2C (those who love LA and art) customers. Also ideal to be positioned as a housewarming or going away gift.\n\nThis art piece was proudly produced in the heart of the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, CA.",
