    "description": "This photo is a self portrait and is my response to my township's bylaws that state that even though I bought and paid for a 6-acre piece of land, I can't have a shelter on the property. In a country where finding affordable housing is becoming more and more of an issue, I highly oppose these antiquated rules that only seems to value local elitism and single family, detached housing projects.
