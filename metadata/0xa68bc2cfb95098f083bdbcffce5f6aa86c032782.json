    "description": "This is a girl looking at. Just as the same work looks different depending on a person's emotions, this work can also be interpreted differently depending on the person's emotional meaning. I wanted to draw that it's a painting that's precious to some people and it's normal to some people, but because everyone is different, I want to draw that it can be interpreted from a variety of perspectives",
