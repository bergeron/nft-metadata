    "description": "Welcome to Kits, the sample marketplace allowing musicians to own their samples and co-create with their favorite artists in ways never before possible.\n\nKits Season 1 features tokenized sample packs from 6 top artists and producers in web3 - TK, AbJo, Edwin, Dot, MSFT and Ramzoid. Over the course of Season 1, each artist will have a dedicated sample pack release, allowing anyone to purchase a license to use their samples.\n\nTo let everyone get a taste of the Kits to come, we are kicking off Season 1 with the Kits Season 1 Preview Pack, a collection of 6 unique editions - one for each artist in Season. Which edition you receive is determined randomly at mint.\n\nEach of the 6 editions will give the holder access to 13 samples: two samples from each artist in Season 1 and one additional unique sample based on which edition is held.\n\nThe Kits Season 1 Preview Pack is available only to those who sign up for the Kits presale by Wednesday, February 8th at 10 AM EST or who held a token of one of the Season 1 artists as of a snapshot on Monday, February 6th.\n\nEach wallet on the presale list can mint up to 6 tokens at .01 ETH each.\n\nMint a Kit.
