    "description": "Exhibited as an evolutionary link between 17th century impressionism and contemporary landscapes, Garrett’s paintings have been featured in museum showings alongside French landscape masters Eugene Boudin (known as the “King of the Skies”) and Maxime Maufra.\n\nThis series, entitled the \"The other side\", represents many of the physical pieces that Garrett created during the time of her museum showings.\n\nThe minimalist representation of atmospheres became synonymous with her work throughout the traditional art world, and today she debuts this genre into the medium of web3.\n\nThis NFT was created in collaboration with Fourthcrown Studio. The movement depicted was generated with Garrett's own hand motions and reveals how her work is created, primarily without a brush.\n",
