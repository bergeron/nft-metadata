Good time really passes quickly, ikr ! This new chapter of my life as a digital artist which started on 25th November 2021 has bloomed gracefully. Experienced my Christmas, merry go rounds, muddy roads and also sunrise and spring here. Just extremely grateful to have you all along with me in this journey.\n\nYou all never made me feel alone anymore. You all helped this scared lost girl which I was a year back, surface up stronger and bolder than ever before. This artwork weaves a story of how a woman is embracing nature in herself and reflecting her femininity. I promise more years will come where I will write these thank you letters as I'm a bookish person forever.  \nThis year has been the best year of my life as I met you guys and discovered myself too.\n\nThank You my family for making it so special for me.  \nI love you all ! ( except for the scammers in my DMs! )\n\n\n\nYours lovingly,  \nManju-sh-ree.\n\n25th Nov 2022  ",
