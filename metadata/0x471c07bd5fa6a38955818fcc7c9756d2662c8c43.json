    "description": "Ever since the family lost the parents(in an accident), the eldest three sons have been taking their fishing boats out to the lake to make ends meet. A family of 17(two houses)has been relying totally on the brothers each day for the past 12 years. Back when the brothers started, they were aged between 12 and 18, but they had to face what life had thrown at them. \n\nNow they've made sure to slowly fulfill their dreams that they've once sacrificed for a greater purpose. The family still leads a very simple life but what once was more than a mirage, now is an attainable dream, thanks to the three.\n\n2734x4069\n",
