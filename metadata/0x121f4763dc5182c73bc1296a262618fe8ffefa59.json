    "description": "”I will create my own creature in the dark, so that my parents do not see me, and enter my little home. I will feed him secretly, I will take him for\na walk every morning, afternoon and night, he will be wrapped in tenderness and emotion, while I will tell him all my deep secrets, until he\nsleeps and dreams that one day, he will be created, adopted and beloved, as I do.”\n\nThis collection is inspired by the neighborhood where I live and grew up, called \"Don Orione\", a neighborhood of monoblocks located in\nthe southern suburbs of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Also in fantastic creatures from different stories that I heard in other lives and wanted so\nmuch to have. These pieces were created with a pinch of Magical Realism, made with mixed techniques, mixing (photography, 2D, 3D,\npainting, collage ++), destroying and altering, with tenderness and fun, the reality in which I live: chaotic, rusty and fantastic.",
