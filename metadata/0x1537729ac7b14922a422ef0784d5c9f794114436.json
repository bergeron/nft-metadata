    "description": "Once in a while, you get to see a scene in front of you, that does not seem real. It seems like a page of an artist's sketchbook happening right in front of you. Even the word 'surreal' does not do it justice.\n\nI was graced with such a beautiful moment, atop Affarwat in Kashmir, standing at 14000 feet above sea level. The majestic Himalayas were right in front of me, as mist and clouds engulfed the scene. As I was about to turn away, with the mountains tucked behind the mist, suddenly this peak announced itself. A gorgeous mountain, amongst the pure white clouds - it immediately caught my eye, and roped my heart into it. It stayed for just a moment, fortunately long enough for me to press the shutter. But even if I hadn't, it had already been stored safely away in my heart as one of those timeless memories. \n\nName: Sketchscape\n\nCreator: Bondhu Dey\n\nMedium: Photography\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: Extended Editorial.\n\nCopyright remains with the creator.",
