    "description": "If there’s one thing I associate with my grandpa the most it would be his sunflowers. As long as I can remember he kept a beautiful sunflower garden in the backyard of his house in town. \n\nI took this picture when my family visited here the first time after his death. The “shack” in the background is where his uncle lived and tragically took his life. It later became where Grandpa stored food and supplies for the animals. I was already shooting this angle when I noticed the sunflowers grown up and tucked in the window.\n\nThis is my favorite of all my photographs. There’s something so powerful in both the sadness and joy depicted here. A shed...stained with dark memories yet remaining in service to the wildlife around. A school bus...surely once home to laughter and worry free souls. Sunflowers...As if grown by the spirit of my grandpa to remind us that if we care for and tend to the lot we’ve been given we can grow something beautiful, even if it looks rusty on the outside.",
