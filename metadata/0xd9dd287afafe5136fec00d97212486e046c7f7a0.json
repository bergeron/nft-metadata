    "description": "I consider \"The journey\" one of the best photos i have taken throughout  all my years of travelling. It was taken back at 2019 at the far ends of Halong Bay in Vietnam. I was sailing around when suddenly a lonely woman appeared in the middle of nowhere\n\nThe closest inhabited floating village was at least 2-3 miles away and I was shocked with the fact that she was rowing so far away from her house. The previous night had rained and it turned out that she was heading to a specific place that mussels had been buried in the sand\n\nThere she would spent the rest of the day gathering as many mussels as possible before rowing back for at least an hour, to her village.Afterwards she would sell the mussels to merchants and with the money made she could buy food for her family for almost a month!\n\nI felt humble to her presence.Her strength, courage and dedication was and still is a great motivation to carry on, to work more and get better",
