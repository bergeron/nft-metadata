    "description": "A spoken word, media rich poem by David Jones, internationally best selling author followed by over 285,000 poetry lovers on Instagram.\n\nThe poem explores how we view conflict and tragedy from a distance but how, as the shadows lengthen for one, they lengthen for us all. Animations and illustrations accompany the reader on their journey through the poem. Narration is by the author and is subtitled.\n\nAll proceeds will be donated to Ukraine as the country fights for its freedom and life. Please see Twitter for more information on the donation.",
