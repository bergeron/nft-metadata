    "description": "\"Everlasting\" by Ben Skaar - Edition of 19\n\nCaptured along the northern edge of the Swiss Alps, \"Everlasting\" is an edition dedicated to my 18th year of life. \n\nThis past year I graduated high school, started to do more work with video, traveled to Hawaii, Switzerland, and Italy, made some life-changing trades in Web3, got onto SuperRare, met many incredible artists and collectors in NYC,  launched my first urban exploring collection, and spent lots of quality time with my family, friends, and girlfriend. \n\nI came into this year unsure of the direction I wanted to go with my life, and came out a whole lot more confident about who I am, and what I was put on this Earth to do. There is still much to learn, and I am looking forward to this next chapter in life.\n\n-Ben (8/11/2022)",
