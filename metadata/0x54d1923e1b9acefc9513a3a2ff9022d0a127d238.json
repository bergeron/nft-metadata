    "description": "This artwork describes 2 souls getting separated. The boy is disappearing and holding his girl for the last time.\n\nNever Imagined I'll be the first one to leave.  \nMy body is getting numb but I can feel your warm touch on my chest. Please don't cry, I'm taking my leave. Your tears will just make me resist it when we both know that I am going to disappear and It can't be stopped. Just let me see the smile on your face. The Smile that made my day bright.  \nThe smile that made me the Happiest. The smile that made me fall in love with you.\n\nYou must be strong as always and at some point, you need to move on. I don't want to be the reason for your sadness. I'm sorry for leaving so early. Everything I imagined about our future was really the future I wanted to see with you and experience with you.\n\nI guess it's time now. I'll be waiting for you in the next world. I'll be watching you from above. Greet me Happy birthday looking up in the sky when it's my birthday!\n\nGoodbye.",
