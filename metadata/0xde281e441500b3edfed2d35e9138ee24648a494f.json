    "description": "The moral lesson of the fable is that one should be careful what they wish for, as the things they desire may not bring them happiness. \n\nThe fable highlights the importance of appreciating what we have and being content with our current situation, rather than always seeking something new or different.    \n \n\n\n\nThere once was a wizard who lived,  \nIn a grand castle, his magic thrived,  \nThrough the land, his powers were known,  \nFor those in need, he would atone.\n\nOne day, while the wizard was out,  \nThieves broke in without a doubt,  \nThey took all his belongings and fled,  \nLeaving the wizard feeling full of dread.\n\nThe wizard tried to catch the thieves,  \nBut alas, he couldn't help but grieve,  \nHe realized that he had been wrong,  \nTo focus on possessions for so long.\n\nThe wizard left his castle and went away,  \nUsing his magic to help each day,  \nHe helped heal the sick, protect the weak,  \nAnd fight for justice for those who couldn't speak.\n\nAs the wizard traveled from town to town,  \nHis reputation spread and grew renowned,  \nFor his selflessness and true compassion,  \nHe became a legend throughout the nation.\n\nThe wizard lived out the rest of his days,  \nUsing his powers in myriad ways,  \nHe learned that helping others was his call,  \nHis true purpose is to serve and help all.\n\nCollection: Aesopica by Storytime DAO  \nhttps://sleekbio.com/shutterfrequency",
