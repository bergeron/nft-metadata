    "description": "This piece is an SVG file, intricately crafted using Signed Distance Functions (SDF) and a technique known as ray marching, typically employed with WebGL. However, in my approach, I adapted this method for Vanilla JavaScript. Furthermore, I introduced a unique element to my creation - SVG paths stylized as strokes, achieved through a 'noisy walk' along the gradient of the shapes. The end result is an SVG file that can be plotted.",
