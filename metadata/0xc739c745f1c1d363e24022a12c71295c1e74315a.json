    "description": "They are born in the midst of various wishes, thoughts and prayers, and eventually these will shake the hearts of the girls.\r\nWill they become the hope for life or the burden of a wish for death?\r\nFlowers are compared to prayers, innocent hearts to braids. Blood and fate as a red thread.\r\n\r\nGirls who are unstable in mind and body. Girls who are pure and vicious.\r\nNo matter what happens to you, no matter how you get dirty, I want to keep telling you that you will always be beautiful."
