    "description": "With the urban transformation initiated about 10 years ago by government policy, Istanbul has been turned into a huge construction site. The areas that were built for the sake of income and the high-rise buildings that were built made a large part of the city dystopian. I tried to focus on the regions where the low-income people are trying to survive in this dystopia and the unplanned urbanization in these regions. The majority of the photographs in the collection were taken in the district of Kagithane, which is located on the European side of Istanbul and is not very known to tourists. Kagithane is located in the center of the European side, very close to the continent's trade, tourism and entertainment centers. A river flowing into the Golden Horn passes through the middle of the district, which is in the form of a valley. Due to its valley shape, it has very steep slopes. Kagithane is also one of the districts most affected by urban transformation.",
