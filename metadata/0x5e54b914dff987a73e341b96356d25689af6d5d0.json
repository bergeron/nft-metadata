    "description": "In this composition, I wanted to feel what it is like to be a free Amazon, galloping on her horse across the endless expanses of our nature.\nIn ancient Greek mythology, Amazons consisting exclusively of women, who went on campaigns under the leadership of their queen and formed a special warlike state. According to legend, the Amazons descended from God Ares and Harmony. To reproduce offspring, the Amazons entered into contact with men of other nations. They sent the born boys to their fathers, from the girls they raised new Amazons!\n",
