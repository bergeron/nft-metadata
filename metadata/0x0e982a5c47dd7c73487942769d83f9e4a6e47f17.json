    "description": "After the purchase, you will receive an uncensored version.Don't forget to write to me.When the depression started, I didn't realize it right away. I couldn't take pictures. And if i was shooting, then it was horror. I didn't like me. Because of the war, I lost my Pornhub and OF. For me, it was a big blow to my income. That's how my depression started. I didn't want to live.This led me to a psychiatrist. This is the first photo shoot when I felt much better thanks to the pills. The Prozac nation? Is my life like a movie? Partly yes. I dedicated this collection to my psychiatrist.",
