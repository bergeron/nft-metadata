    "description": "Back in 2017, I was contracted to do some photo work in Rwanda by a coffee roaster who sources green beans there. The client was well into their multi-country sourcing trip, when I was scheduled to meet them in Rwanda for a 3-day tour of various coffee washing stations situated around the country.\n\nUpon arriving in Rwanda, the border patrol told me that my travel visa was not approved, and I had to get on the next plane out of the country.\n\nAfter spending a night in Belgium, I was notified that my visa had now been approved, and I was able to book the next flight back.\n\nI was nearly 2 days late, and very discouraged. I had to cram 2 days into 1, rush my tours, and wasn't able to tour with my client as they had tight schedules.\n\nFeeling exhausted and overwhelmed, I arrived at my first stop. This photo was one of my first clicks of the entire trip. The pure joy in these women's smiles instantly made me forget about everything that had happened, and set the tone for an unforgettable trip.",
