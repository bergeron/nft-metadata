    "description": "\"Across The Delta\" is one of our first paintings, inspired by two different musicians.\nWhile creating ATD, we listened to a lot of Sven Van Hees & David Sanborn. Sven's album \"Exotica\"\nhouses the track which we named this painting after. We also loved the shapes and colors from the\nalbum cover \"Voyeur\" by David Sanborn.\n\n1/1 - Upon purchase, collector will receive the physical/original gallery wrapped canvas ready to hang, demanding 48x60inches of real estate on their wall!",
