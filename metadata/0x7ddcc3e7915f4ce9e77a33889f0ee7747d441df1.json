    "description": "May 2019, my first NFT in the collection\n\nSize: 1920 x 1280 px, JPEG\n\nIndonesia, Bali is the only country so far that I wanted to stay in for a long time. We flew here with a large group of 100 people. Almost everyone flew back after 7 days.\n\nI didn't want to fly home from there, so I changed my return plane ticket to a later date and lived on this island for 1 month, 14 days of which were almost completely alone, communicating with locals through Google translator on my phone. My English is basic.\n\nBeautiful moments filled with happiness, nature, warmth, freedom. Here I first got on a bike and immediately drove, after that it became my companion for all time, traveled many kilometers of the island, the cities of Denpasar, Nusa Dua, Kuta, Ubud. \n\nIt is love at first sight and from the first minute, I dream to go back there for at least 3 months in winter.
