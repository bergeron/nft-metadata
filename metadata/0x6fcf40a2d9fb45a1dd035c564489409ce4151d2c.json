    "description": "Gremplin Ultra Deep Field is a 1/1 by Vincent van Toad in honour of Vincent van Gogh's 169th birthday on March 30, 2022.\n\nThe CC0 artwork unites two legendary projects in the public domain: CrypToadz by Gremplin and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, taken by NASAâ€™s Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe NFT was minted with a Manifold smart contract. Each token represents 1/69 fractional ownership of the GUDF.\n\nThe story of the piece can be found at [gudf.org](https://www.gudf.org), and the 69\" x 69\" physical piece will reside at SpaceX Starbase, the gateway to Mars.\n\nðŸŒ»~ Vincent\n\n*\"For my part, I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream.\"* - VvG",
