    "description": "\"Naples Blues\" is my first composite photograph creation and this drop is in dedication to the beautiful Naples pier that used to be.\n\nI was feeling blue after I found out the pier was gone, but looking through my previous photographs and remembering those moments brought me some joy.\n\nThis moonset over the pier during blue hour is my personal favorite and I thought this would be the perfect time to share it with the world for my first Open Edition in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\nI used a 500mm telephoto lens with my full frame Nikon D850 for the moon (F9 @1/60sec ISO 100) and an 18-27 wide angle lens on a Sony a6500 crop sensor for the rest of the scene. (F11 @4sec ISO 100)\n\nPost Processing: Adobe Lightroom; Adobe Photoshop; Topaz Sharpen AI",
