    "description": "The desert carries endless, broad expanses of land and sky. It contains waves of sand that flow toward the horizon where the only sound is the wind rustling through the sand dunes. From the air, the desert is a place where you can see for miles in every direction, and the horizon seems infinite. In this particular location, nestled in the heart of the desert, I was surprised to stumble upon a small music festival oasis. One of the attractions was a thrilling, spinning whirler ride. I found it to be quite an amazing contrast to see this buzzing and lively whirler breathing life into this otherwise dry and desolate landscape.",
