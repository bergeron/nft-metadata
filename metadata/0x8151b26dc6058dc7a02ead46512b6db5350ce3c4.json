    "description": "VOICES II is about searching for moments of relief and escape from your own mind, but eventually succumbing to the chaos and noise. It's the second segment of a two-part song that was written and produced live on Twitch, and collectors who hold VOICES I will have access to mint VOICES II for free.\n\nPart I was originally created as a new set introduction for my debut performance at Red Rocks this year, and officially premiered on October 21, 2022 to the sold out venue. VOICES I and II will be included in Dot's next album, and collectors who hold both songs will unlock an exclusive airdrop from the album in 2023. \n\nLyrics:\nI just wanna drown the voices in my head\nAnd if I play my music louder, maybe I'll feel better",
