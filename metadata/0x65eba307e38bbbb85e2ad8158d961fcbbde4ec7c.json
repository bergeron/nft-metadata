    "description": "\"But when the melancholy fit shall fall  \nSudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,  \nThat fosters the droop-headed flowers all,  \nAnd hides the green hill in an April shroud;  \nThen glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,  \nOr on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,  \nOr on the wealth of globèd peonies;  \nOr if thy mistress some rich anger shows,  \nEmprison her soft hand, and let her rave,  \nAnd feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.\n\nShe dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;  \nAnd Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips  \nBidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,  \nTurning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:  \nAy, in the very temple of Delight  \nVeil’d Melancholy has her sovran shrine,  \nThough seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue  \nCan burst Joy’s grape against his palate fine;  \nHis soul shall taste the sadness of her might,  \nAnd be among her cloudy trophies hung.\"\n\nJohn Keats - Ode on Melancholy  \n",
