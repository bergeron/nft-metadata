      "text": "Man you gotta listen\nTurn my tweets into the vision\nTurn my dreams into the mission\nCooking beats inside the kitchen\nUnlimited ammunition\n& gimme a couple wishes\nI’ll prolly get a Gundam\nTo bundle up all riches\nThe keys to success is in flipping a couple switches\nTaking a couple risks and\nDropping a couple of bitches\nThrowing a couple of pitches\nTaking a couple pictures \nand trying to decide if you spike or is you vicious   \n\nMastering my bankai like I’m Ichigo\nDon’t rush to find the answers even if this world acts like we should know\nDon’t stress about the past - not even a week ago\nI’m Rita with the staff, I’mma  focus on how we can grow\nGet up off your ass, let’s see how far that we can go\nDon’t shatter like a glass, let’s try to make the speakers blow\nMy nigga what’s the rush, you don’t gotta go fast\nSometimes you gotta charge it up like a ki blast\n\nLife is like a spirit bomb, charging up by others\nWe can reach full power with the right brothers and mothers\nAmaterasu, the fire of a hundred Summers\nJust know that you worth isn’t determined by a number\nHoes on my dick like I unlocked my Byakugan\nI mean I did, but that’s not what this is about\nWord of advice, stop chasing the clout\nWord of advice, look for another route \nWord of advice, don’t take my advice\nPlay another song, maybe play something nice\nMaybe hop on a Lapras, and shoot a beam of ice\nMake your own path, or you’ll pay the price\nYou don’t gotta rap, you don’t gotta make beats\nDon’t try be Black Dave, you don’t wanna be me\nYou don’t gotta be liked, I mean this isn’t IG\nIf you can be yourself you can truly be free",
