    "description": "Teresa Galán reflects on the concept of intimacy and how it relates to personal relationships, the public and private spheres, and the relationship between the artist and her models. The author also mentions that intimacy is a term that is not frequently mentioned in our culture and is often associated with romantic relationships. It further explores how intimacy gives cohesion to personal relationships and how it marks the border between the public and private. Teresa Galán plays with anonymity in her artworks and how it puts the audience in a \"no man's land\". The text invites readers to engage with the art pieces and to share intimate moments, perspectives and the compositional proposal of the artist.",
