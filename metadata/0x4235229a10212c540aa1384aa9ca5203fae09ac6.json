    "description": "256 hybrid analog / digital paintings, created from a limited selection of brush strokes.\n\nThis project started with a series of acrylic & water-color layers painted on paper and canvas. These elements were scanned and subsequent digital layers were drawn over them. All layers were pulled apart and arbitrarily recombined. Then dramatic color shifts were made. While these images consist entirely of my own brush strokes, they are recombined in ways I hadnâ€™t intended or imagined. Upon completion, all brush layers were catalogued to show how often they were used within the full collection.\n\nwww.intangiblefields.com\n\n1/1\n7506 x 5646 jpeg\n\n#000 uses 13 brush layers:\n\nDramaticStrokes #34  (12)\nDramaticStrokes #24  (7)\nDramaticStrokes #15  (17)\nLine Work #7  (24)\nWatercolor #22  (13)\nWatercolor #15  (22)\nWatercolor #14  (78)\nPastel #25  (5)\nPastel #24  (1)\nPastel #22  (4)\nPastel #17  (11)\nPastel #15  (30)\nAcrylic #1  (4)\n\n(x) = how often this element is used in the full collection of 256 works",
