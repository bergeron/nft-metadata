    "description": "This work delves into envisioning the face of Goddess Kali. It was a wonderful challenge to create her eyes. I endeavoured to find a pair of eyes that pulled you in and ultimately had you transfixed on her eternal gaze. \n\n“Kali's nakedness shows that she has cast away illusion; in her, the entire truth about life and death is revealed. Even her color is esoteric; Kali's dark colors stand for the ultimate void state, where as differences dissolve into the absolute beyond all form. Her sword is the force that slices delusion, ignorance, false hope, and lies. Her position on top of Shiva reveals that she is the dynamic force in the universe, the power that churns the stillness of the void, so worlds can be created inside that transcendent nothingness.” ― Sally Kempton, (Awakening to Kali: The Goddess of Radical Transformation)\n\nThe NFT collector will receive a signed 21 x 19 inch print as a BONUS GIFT.\n\nSpecs: 6000 x 5316px @ 300dpi (19MB)",
