    "description": "Quantum Skull is my first work using quantum computers. To create it, I worked with fellow artist Russell Huffman to procedurally generate an image set from observations of actual atoms on a machine called ibmq_montreal. The images themselves reference my childhood memories of endless hours playing video games as well as modern references to my AI Imagined Faces series, bitGANs, and CryptoPunks. Tapping into the properties of quantum noise (unchecked randomness) and quantum superposition (where objects are in more than one position at same time until a final observation takes place), these images were generated, combined, and fed into the AI of my painting robots which then painted them using creative feedback loops. Quantum Skull begins at the atomic level, ends with a painted canvas, and has an animation that shows everything in between.",
