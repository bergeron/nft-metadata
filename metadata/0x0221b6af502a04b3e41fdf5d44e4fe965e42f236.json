    "description": "Ducks always seem to be a friendly face when were out birding. This appears to be a Mexican Duck which both sexes look similar to female Mallards. Mallards and Mexican Ducks do hybridize freely so this may be a hybrid. Either way its a friendly ducky that wanted its photo taken.",
