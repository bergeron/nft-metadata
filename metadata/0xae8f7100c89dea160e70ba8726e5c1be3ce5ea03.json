    "description": "The geometric shapes in the centre of the piece were created using water, light and sound. The vibrations were captured using a camera on the surface of a speaker. Every image was created by the human voice - this is the visualization of MRKII beatboxing sounds. \n\nEVOAR was developed over time with a narrative rooted by Cymatics. The images grew larger expanding into 3d characters. The progress can been seen on MRKsteels HEN Profile [HEN](https://hic.af/MRKsteels)\n\nCollector will receive full video version, PNG 2160X2700 that contains the genesis MRKI cymatic piece as well as the full audio track.\n\nThey continue to grow!",
