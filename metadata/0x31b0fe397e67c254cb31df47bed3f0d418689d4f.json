    "description": "This painting reflects the period Gauguin spent in Polynesia. The painting depicts a group of women and children in the traditional dress of the local people. Gauguin has created an atmosphere of warmth and vitality through the use of colours and the placement of the figures, especially by emphasising the body contours of the women.\n\nThe painting bears the characteristics of post-impressionism style. In this style, colours are used intensely and patterns and figures are simplified with geometric shapes. Gauguin used a similar technique in this painting. In addition, the painting depicts the lifestyle of the local people, the beauty of nature and scenes from daily life, while symbolic meanings and the artist's personal experiences are also reflected.",
