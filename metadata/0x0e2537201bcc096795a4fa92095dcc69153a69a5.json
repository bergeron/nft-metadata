    "description": "Taking revenge isn’t always the best option. If it doesn’t heal your wound, you just may like it. So try not to make it your new addiction. It is said that the best method of revenge is to live your life in the best possible way.\n\n\"Oiwa / Tasty revenge\", is part of my photographic series \"My Demons\", which depicts my internal conflict. Varying in different situations from my personal and romantic life, this series expresses my deepest emotions and thoughts from each of those moments.\n\nWe tend to use Demons as beings that represent the evil, vices, and defects of humanity. Each Of my demons bears its name from demonology and is interpreted in a personal way. An average additional goal of this series is also to reflect on the circumstances that led me to those defects.\n\nArt from [\"My Demons\" Series] by Amelie\n2135 X 3929 Pixels JPG",
