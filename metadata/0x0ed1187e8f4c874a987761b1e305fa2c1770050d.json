    "description": "Part of my Pillow Fort series exploring my mental health through self-portraiture and textile manipulation. \n\nThe self-portrait was created during a period of self-isolation. They are a continuation of my digital textile art practice where I bring fabrics and textiles from my studio and everyday life into my digital practice. These works are digital collages constructed from manipulated photographs of the fabrics of pillows I was sleeping on and piling around me for comfort during my self isolation. \n\n\nSelf-Portrait with Izzy\n0:13\n2400p x 2400p, MP4 \nDecember 2021\n1/1\n",
