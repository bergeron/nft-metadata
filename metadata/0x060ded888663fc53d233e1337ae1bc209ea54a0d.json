    "description": "A great flood swept through all the lands, decimating almost all civilizations and leaving only a few survivors in its wake. The survivors were left to pick up the pieces and try to rebuild.\n\nThe survivors were struggling to rebuild their homes and communities, sacred humanoid entities appeared. They told the survivors that they had been sent to help them rebuild, but in a new and stronger way.\n\nThe Entities introduced the survivors to the use of psychedelic medicine, which they said would help them tap into their deepest wisdom and creativity. The survivors were skeptical at first, but soon discovered that the medicine truly did help them think more clearly and come up with innovative solutions to the problems they faced.\n\nWith the help of the entities and the medicine, the survivors were able to rebuild their homes and communities in a way that was more resilient and sustainable than before. They were also able to reconnect with their spiritual selves and understand their place in the universe.\n\nThe survivors knew that they had been blessed by the sacred  and were forever grateful for the gifts they had been given. They lived in harmony with the land and the people around them.",
