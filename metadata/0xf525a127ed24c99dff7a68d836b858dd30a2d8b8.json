    "description": "It is what it is, and it will be what it will be. We are incorrect to think we can control most things.\n\nThis song is about deciding not to worry in regards to what other people will inevitably do. All you can do is work with what is given to you and love yourself enough to recognise the flaws in your treatment, and the way you treat others.\n\nYou will only ever be you.\n\nHappy New Year, fuckers <3",
