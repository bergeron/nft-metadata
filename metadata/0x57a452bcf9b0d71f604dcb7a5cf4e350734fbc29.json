    "description": "The photo has a resolution of 4888 × 3258. You can print it if you wish. You can use it in your metaverse universe. Many professions began to disappear with the development of technology and the spread of factories. A low shutter speed is used to create motion blur in this photo, which depicts a lost profession. This makes the viewer feel the current movement and strengthens the effect of the photograph.",
