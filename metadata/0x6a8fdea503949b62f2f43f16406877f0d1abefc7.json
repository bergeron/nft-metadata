    "description": "Nature is the most amazing artist and that's why I became photographer.\nWhen life offers us such a moment of life, no words can describe the sense of well-being that invades us. Such feeling is stronger than get all the gold of the world, the sense of being in harmony with the elements surround us is priceless, ephemeral and timeless at the same time. \nOn the edge of the glacier gate, you can spot my colleague and very good friend \"Fie Viola\" working hard as a glacier guide for years with the same passion and always enjoying to play the model for our group of photographers. \n\nVatnaj√∂kull glacier, Iceland.",
