    "description": "One of the most notorious phenomena of contemporary art is the attempt by artists to generate movements that go against the canons established by experts, curators, & gallery owners of their era. These movements manifest themselves through new artistic works with the objective of demystifying traditional art & pushing new perspectives forward.\n\nHowever, these movements also bring outside economic interests that treat art as a commodity. In this game of speculation, exaggerated sums of money are paid for pieces created without intellectual effort or message. This speculation has fueled a chaotic panorama that has gripped the crypto art community.\n\nTaking these factors into account, a group of artists from around the world - the Crazy Friends - has created an artistic proposal named “Esta 60.” In this collection, these artists are presenting simple works that question the conceptual value of art vs the pricing that is placed on it. \n\nWe want to challenge the absurd with the absurd!",
