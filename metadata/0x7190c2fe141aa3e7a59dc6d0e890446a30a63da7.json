    "description": "Rare Piece,\nI took a picture of it myself in the desert.\nSahara rose is the name given to this natural mineral stone due to its external aspect in the shape of marvelous rose petals distinguished by their variety. All sand roses are different, you will never find two identical roses, each piece is unique in its shape, color, size and petals.",
