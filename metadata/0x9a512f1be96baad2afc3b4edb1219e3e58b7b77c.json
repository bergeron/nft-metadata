    "description": "Watching injured children from Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela, Sudan, and some other parts of the world being affected by the daily crisis happening, leaving them as orphans, is really troubling.\n\nA mother narrated how her 6-year-old daughter asked her, “Mom, why is Russia invading Ukraine?”. She didn’t realize she was there as she was updating herself on the current events happening around the world.\n\nShe couldn’t find the words to tell her daughter. How can she answer her when she was trying to understand the situation herself? All she knew was she felt anxious and heartbroken when she saw the news.\n\nShe was overwhelmed with sadness. We are still dealing with a pandemic and then this?\n\nCould this be the start of a world war? How will this conflict affect my family and my children? What will happen to the civilians in Ukraine? What future awaits us?\n\nThese could be our kids. No matter what, it's always our family first!!",
