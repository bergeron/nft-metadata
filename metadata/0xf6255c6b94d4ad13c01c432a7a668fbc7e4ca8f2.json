    "description": "Revival\n\nCreative revival is first and foremost an exercise in receptivity. By opening the door to your own mind, you achieve a breadth of vision.\n\nI trust my perceptions,\" is another helpful statement for a period of profound personality shifts. - A stronger and brighter personality emerges in me.\n\nMany people cannot tolerate criticism because they nurture such a characteristic as perfectionism.\n\nThe problem with this quality is that perfectionism is a refusal to move forward and create. Instead, you allow some unfortunate steps to start a vicious cycle from which it is difficult to escape.\n\n\nI am taking small but confident steps toward my goal. I don't want people to talk loudly about me right now. But the time will come and it will happen. I will not give up, despite the difficulties. I love what I do, every inch of my creativity. And I want to show my world through my art. \n\nA new style, a new technique and another piece of my soul to my collection.\n ",
