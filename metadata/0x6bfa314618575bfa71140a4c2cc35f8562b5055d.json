    "description": "Foundation is everything. Our wings are only as strong and travel as far as the surface they have to land on. Soaring to new heights further reveals the divisions in our system and as a result our communities. We must expand our time/energy to seal these gaps. This image was made using a DJI drone after the icebreaker boat went through the Chicago river.  Roughly 5 degrees out. This is simply a receipt for a 24 x 36 print + boarder from Print Lab Chicago and then choice of black or white gallery frame from CMM Framing! As Chicago as it gets right there. The frame work is insane! Full disclosure a vertically cropped version of this will exists as an NFT in future. This landscape version reveals the full story though. It is my first professional print and done so in a beautiful way. Quality is unmatched. It will exist in my possession or viewed in a gallery in the meantime.  Shipping not included. If Chicago pick up is not available, I can facilitate a Chicago donation/auction/delivery! ",
