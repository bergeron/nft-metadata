    "description": "The Honu Collection #1: Brutus  \nArtist: Jason O'Rourke   \nDecember 2013   \nEdition: 1/1 NFT \nLicense: Extended Editorial \n\nBrutus is L1, the first Honu identified by volunteers as a regular basker at Laniakea Beach on Oahu's North Shore. The beach is often referred to as \"Turtle Beach\" because of the number of Honu regularly seen on the sand there. It has been said that Brutus was the most photographed green sea turtle in the world, since visitors to Oahu frequently posed for photos with Brutus in them.\n\nThe Honu Collection is curated from almost 20 years living in Hawaii. I photographed these Honu (Hawaiian green sea turtles) on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island. \n\nI volunteer with several non-profits focused on education, conservation, and outreach for Hawaii’s endangered wildlife, including Mālama i nā Honu, which works with these Honu.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from each sale will be donated to Mālama i nā Honu to provide resources for their conservation efforts. This helps ensure that these beautiful green sea turtles are around for future generations to experience.\n\nExtended Editorial License: NFT holder is free to display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder, as long as the NFT creator is credited.
