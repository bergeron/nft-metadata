    "description": "During my visit to this Coal Mine, I was attracted to this miner and thought to study him and capture him because he was working without any safety with full of dust, darkness and air.\nTheir life is like a Sailor who has to board a ship across the wave keeping his life on a stake and having black lungs,  life and illness as well due to lack of money and treatment. It was a heart-breaking revelation to know that most of the coal mine workers died at an early age due to lung related illnesses as an occupational hazard. Working in coal mines is dangerous â€” miners have to deal with toxic gases, plus the threat of being crushed, drowned, or injured from fires and explosions. The dark mines also metaphors on their dark life as well. These poor people carry along a lifelong lung disease due to pollution in the mines. And put their life at risk along daily while entering inside the mines.\n \nPhoto Size- 5000X3262 \nCamera- Canon Mark IV\n\n",
