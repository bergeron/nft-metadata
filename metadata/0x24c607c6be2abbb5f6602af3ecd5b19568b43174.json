    "description": "Through my paintings, I strive to capture the unspoken words of women, conveying their emotions and thoughts without relying on prepositions. By employing the depth of their gaze and the silence of closed mouths, I delve into their inner worlds. To bring forth their essence, I utilize vibrant Fauvism colors and expressive strokes rooted in expressionism.",
