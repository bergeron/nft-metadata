    "description": "Artist : Kriangkrai Kongkhanun\nYear : 2021\n\nJust found that human suffering did not happen coincidently, but it was caused by a reason, as well as other phenomena which resulted from peopleâ€™s actions. Karma is the law of logic; it is an international law for living things. Those causes of suffering are not beyond human control suffering which is like sinking into the bottom of a mind full of emotions like fear, suspicion, confusion, madness, desire, etc., all of which are combined inseparably. Suffering also includes what is abnormal which may be caused by imagination or reality. To sense the songs of the soul causes humans to want to become untangled from earthly things in order to find the serene land.",
