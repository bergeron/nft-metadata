    "description": "My mother is a painter. This was painted by one of her art students offline. Think he got inspiration from another artist so the work is not 'original'. GYG is a man close to his 70s. A random encounter with our family had him get immersed into the world of art and painting. \n\nI wanted to share his journey with you.\n\nAll ETH made goes to the artist.\n\nArtist: GYG\nPaint: Acrylic paint\n\nWith love from Seoul",
