    "description": "Alone with the moon\n\nHere I am. Lost somewhere in the wilderness of nature in the middle of the night. Staring at the moon. How can something be that beautiful? The night is coming to an end, the sky begins to brighten, and the stars disappear. But the moon is still here. I forget about the cold and ignore my feet getting wet and frozen after hours of wandering through forests. I don’t care. I've been looking for this moment. My camera set on a tripod captured this shot a long time ago. But I’m still standing here, fascinated by the moon and unable to move.\n",
