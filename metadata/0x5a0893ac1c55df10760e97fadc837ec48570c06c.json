    "description": "The conversations around global black music are changing. Hip-Hop’s dominance of the first two decades of the millennium, in combination with Afrobeats’ meteoric rise in worldwide popularity,  has the world at a cultural crossroads. At the interesection of these cultural movements are the cities that have propelled and bolstered their growth: Atlanta & Lagos.\n \nWritten and released between trips to and from the Sister Cities, Kelechief’s forthcoming album “ATLagos” is his contribution to the shifting cultural landscape. The Atlanta native, who is also the son of Nigerian immigrants, samples vibes from both sides of the Atlantic. Trap. Afrobeats. RnB. Highlife. Drill. Alte. Jazz. Amapiano. The album represents, wrestles with, and celebrates both sides of Kelechief identity.\n \nThe Amaarae assisted “Fine Wine” is a smooth altè influenced tune driven by a lush piano sample and bouncing drums.",
