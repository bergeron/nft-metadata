    "description": "Is there a memory you have that you would like to revisit? An emotion you would like to feel once more? Is there a person you would like to spend one more moment with? \n\nMaybe it's a first date you'd like to go on again. Or the feeling of meeting someone for the first time again. Or maybe it's holding someone for the last time one more time.\n\nPrecious moments that you did know would be so precious so you did not cherish them correctly.\n\nWhat would you give from your present to visit the past? \n\nHow many instances in your life were you completely present in that you can honestly say you lived to the fullest?\n\nWe must learn to live in the present and only use the past to further ignite our complete existence in the now. \n\nForget the bad that came before the good that is yet to come.\n\nBut then again, is it even possible to fully present in any given situation?",
