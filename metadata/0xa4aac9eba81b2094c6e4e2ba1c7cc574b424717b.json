The variety of vivid colors filled with movement instill a sense of urgency as the police frantically try to apprehend the criminals and seize their contraband. \n\nThe bright drug paraphernalia floating above the building add to the intensity of the scene that overall is trying to create a conversation around the chaotic effects of drug use and the relationships it can have with the so called authorities.",
