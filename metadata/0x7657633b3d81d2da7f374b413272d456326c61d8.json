    "description": "When two worlds collide. \n\nMy very first passion was horses and combined with my current passion of photography, I felt this was the most fitting photo to mint as my first NFT. \n\nYou can learn a lot from animals and horses shaped a lot of who I am today. Learning how to ride taught me confidence, caring for horses taught me responsibility, training taught me patience, the teamwork between horse and rider taught me how to communicate without saying any words, and the dream of owning my own horse, which was just out of reach, taught me how to work hard for what I wanted. \n\nWhen I took this photo it was the first time it felt like it had all come full circle. What I once worked so hard for, but wasn’t able to get, contributed to my current dream and what I’ve been able, and still am striving, to achieve. ",
