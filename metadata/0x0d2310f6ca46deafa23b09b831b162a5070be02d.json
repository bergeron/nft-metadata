    "description": "Engagement Farming is a personal reflection on two phenomena that stand out in the world of social networks, more specifically those that are used in the NFT market.\n\nThe first is the search for popularity and followers. This is characterized by exploiting the talent and fame of other individuals or projects to generate personal gain and prestige.\n\nThe second phenomenon is the generation of emotional marketing, which consists of convincing potential consumers of the NFT market through feelings such as pity, empathy, guilt and even promises of exorbitant economic benefits.Such a new, competitive and changing market that develops within the framework of social networks is the perfect ecosystem for opportunists and speculators who will not miss the opportunity to use mass psychological manipulation tools. \n\nFrom the point of view of NFT artists and creators who find themselves in this scenario, one must ask, to what extent would we be willing to use these emotional marketing tools to generate engagement, approval,popularity and sales ?",
