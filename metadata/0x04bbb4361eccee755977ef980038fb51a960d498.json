    "description": "One of the most iconic animals from my home land is the highland cow. Known worldwide for its huge horns, red shaggy coat and tardiness, the animal is sought after by many photographers and nature enthusiasts on their visit to Scotland. \n\nConsidering their appeal and love, they are actually very difficult to find and can only be seen in a few specific locations year round. During the last six years, I’ve managed to locate some of these spots - this being one of them. From Aberfoyle, driving past three stunning lochs, another body of water appears - Loch Arklet.\n\nDuring a winter visit, I came across a herd of them on the shoreline, munching away on their staple diet of hay. This photo, in my eyes, emphasises their toughness and the resilience they put up with in the Scottish outdoors year in, year out. One of my favourite photos to date. \n\nArtist: Alistair Horne\n\nName: The Hungry Highlander\n\nEdition: 10/10\n\nLocation: Loch Arklet, Scotland\n\nDate Created: February 2017\n\nDimensions: 3807 ×  2541\n\nGear: Nikon D750 w/ Nikkor 24-70mm lens\n\nGenre: Wildlife Photography\n\nLicense: NFT holder is free to use on social media, private display and in virtual galleries, as long as the creditor is credited.
