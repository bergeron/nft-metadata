    "description": "MRI images of a Japanese Pepper Bonsai (Xanthoxylum Piperitum)\n\nArchive of Digital Plants is both a speculation on the future of digital archives and the visualisation of how organic life will be experienced and interacted with in the Metaverse. The project started in 2019 with artists Jake Tan and Ernest Wu exploring what plant life looks like through an MRI machine, and is a continuation of the artistic process of investigating the intersections between man, machine and nature.",
