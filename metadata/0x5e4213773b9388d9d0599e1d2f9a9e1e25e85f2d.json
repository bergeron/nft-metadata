    "description": "The original song was created to be the soundtrack to a great day, and inspire you to take life “Lightly”. The og song was made at the tail end of 2020 with Lani Rose. As we all know that was not a great year, and there was a lot of anxiety and negative feelings surrounding that time. With all the negativity and bad vibes happening I wanted to make a song that could inspire a positive feeling, and perspective. \n\nThe OG song got featured in NBA2k22 and has over over 1 million streams on Spotify. First of all I wanna say John - “ThaKracken” is one of the most kind people I’ve encountered in music, for over a year he would just send me deals and freebies on audio plugins that I would’ve otherwise never knew about. One day ThaKracken sent me this CRAZY dope song he finished, and at the time I was looking for a more electronic, hype version of “Lightly”. So I asked ThaKracken if he would be down to do a remix. \n\nThe original song was a more chill but vibey approach to Lightly, but this remix is the hype version that really reflects the positive energy of the lyrics in the production. I hope you are enjoying your day, and taking it lightly.",
