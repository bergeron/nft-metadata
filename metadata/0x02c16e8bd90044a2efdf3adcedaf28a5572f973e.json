    "description": "Bearsuits has always wanted to be someone people know and get along with, some one with friends and people to turn to, but sometimes life isn’t as easy as that. Bearsuits started to hold theirselves back, pushing away the outside world for the comfort of solemness. It felt like “being swallowed by a bear” (the birth idea of Bearsuits). But they know they had to make a change to be who they want to be, so Bearsuits put themselves on show for the world to see in as many wacky ways as possible, embracing who they were meant to be.",
