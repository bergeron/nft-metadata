    "description": "On May 6th 2023, i traveled to North Bend Washington for a photoshoot. During this time i visited several locations where the iconic tv series \"Twin Peaks\" was filmed. This piece in particular was shot at Snoqualmie falls. It was such a powerful experience because despite being a a David Lynch fan i'd never seen Twin Peaks at the time of this shoot. My connection to this shot and many other shots that day felt unbiased and natural but like many before me i was drawn to the places lynch and many others were. This shoot while simplistic in nature was invigorating and deeply inspiring. This piece is an animated variant of the original photograph as well as my first attempt at a still motion photo. \n\nHolders of this edition will be entered into a raffle and the winner will be airdropped the original 1/1 photograph when minting ends.\n\nIf you mint more than one edition you will receive a never before seen variant edition of Snoqualmie Falls! \n\nNow if you'll excuse me, i'm going to catch up on some Twin Peaks.  \n",
