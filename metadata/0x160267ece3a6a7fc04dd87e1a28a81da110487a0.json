    "description": "Inspired by the film \"Dune\", my fantasy created a lost desert world where water may have once been. This traveler is trying to find a way out to a civilization that has long adapted to the difficulties of this world, because they found a time when there was water, and then learned to survive in these harsh places without it. Will he be able to find his way to life?",
