    "description": "Every soul has its own energy. When we born we have a small poor branch inside us. And while we are growing up, this branch becomes bigger and modifies.\n\nWith our actions we water, fertilize or destroy our “spiritual plant”. It can become huge, healthy and full of vital energy or vice versa — dry, weak and full of poison that can intoxicate other neighboring living beings. \n\nTake good care of your plant.",
