    "description": "The world as we know it has changed forever. Through the pandemic, an emergence and ultimate rebirth of creativity have become imminent in the form of NFTs. This is a marketplace for art unlike any other, where inspired creators around the world auction individual pieces of their work for values few could have ever imagined.\n\nThe dark side was once a place where creatives were controlled by a force that exchanged art production for less than an inspirational monetary exchange. This new shift has put creators in the driverâ€™s seat, ultimately giving the creators full creative control and a new hope for the future.\n\nInspired by this new shift and power of the art world, we created this series of NFTs that speaks to this new wave of art and pay homage to a popular culture iconic representation of dark forces. The pieces are presented in a powerful, fresh, and deconstructed manner, boldly expressing this new period in art.",
