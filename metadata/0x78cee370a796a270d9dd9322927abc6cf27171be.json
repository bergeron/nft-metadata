    "description": "In 1831 during the Industrial Revolution, a doctor in London named James Johnson described his city as modern Babylon, a place that was the center of tensions that were getting more and more intense by the 'crawling waves of men'. Tension, according to him, causes a state of 'the body and mind are between sick and healthy, but closer to a psychiatric disorder'. Johnson named this disease a complaint of the ferocity of the times. The most detrimental effect of this disease is 'a serious face contorted with suffering'. This is the wrinkled face of our young generation.\n\n\nThe Human Abstract 01.  \n1/1 Collection which has theme and studying about Psychotic Disorder. \nDigital Illustration. \nMade in 2023 by Rossi Rahardian aka Spacewombat",
