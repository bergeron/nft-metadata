    "description": "‘The Cross We Embrace‘\n\nWe all carry weight \nfor those we love and for the world.     \n\nMy thoughts often return to the cross as a symbol, a form  \nas a symbol, a form of hardships and sufferings \nas a guide for humility, kindness and ways to love \nand to lift us above fears to use our given talents as a gift to the world.\n\n‘The Cross We Embrace’ was created for the second Flannel Collective exhibition “From Thought to Form” a FND curated World. This group exhibition was instrumental in providing me with the strength to re-approach this sacred form.  \n\n4000px x 3916px  \n40.5 MB  \nOriginal painting Oil on Canvas (2023) \nEAK",
