    "description": "The planet is covered in Geodetic Markers, also called survey markers to mark key survey points on the Earth's surface.\n\nThey are often founded at the summit of high hills, offering a contemplative moment to their visitors.\n\nThis 'Geodetic Moment' is a study of our inner selves, and how a shift in perspective is all that's needed to completely change what we see.\n\nThis photograph was taken in the depths of New Zealand's winter, coinciding with the NFT winter of 2022.\n\nView [Geodetic Moments] of 2021 (https://opensea.io/collection/geodetic-moments) collection.\n\nThis place has become sacred for the artist to visit to stay connected to the most special people in his life.\n\nArtist: No\nCity: No\nDay: Saturday\nDirection: Forwards\nGeodetic Marker: Yes\nPeople: No\nSea: No\nStars: No\nSun: Yes\nSunset: Yes\nMoon: Yes\nTime: 5:25 PM\nWeather: Rainbow\n\nLook to the horizon and measure where you stand.\n\nLook forward and see whatâ€™s possible.",
