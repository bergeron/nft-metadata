    "description": "Being a mother can be overwhelming at times, even when it's also the most amazing feeling in the world. A mother feels a sense of purpose when she looks into her baby's eyes. Even when she feels like she's falling apart, she'll do whatever it takes to ensure that her children are loved, cherished, and well taken care of, and she'll sacrifice anything and everything to make that happen. In this piece, I'm trying to show those moments where she feels defeated, and taking on all fears and worries that her loved ones feel.",
