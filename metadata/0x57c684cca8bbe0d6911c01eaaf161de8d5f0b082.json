    "description": "The Shape of Water series incorporates bizarre sea creatures, allusions to Greek mythology and a futuristic setting. Mochic created fashion looks that tell a mysterious, beautiful story - a story about love: water is invisible and shapeless, but it can envelop us, just like love among us, invisible yet surrounding us.\n\n\nThe Shape of Water series carries Mochic's imagination of the deep sea. More than 90% of the oceans in the world have not been explored. The dreamy and mysterious mermaid, the Siren with a seductive singing voice, and the overlord squid of the Viking legend. Literature can be tested, who can be sure that they do not exist?\n",
