    "description": "This image isolates the Hydrogen within M42 the Great Orion Nebula from other elements and removes the stars.\n\nOne of the brightest and most stunning nebulae in the night sky visible easily during the winter in the Northern Hemisphere even from light polluted areas.  It is about 1350 light years away from earth and a stupendous 24 light years across. \n\nThis image was shot with a dedicated monochrome astrophotography camera over multiple nights over winter 2021/22. Over 4 hours of exposure was used to create this image.\n\nPhotographer: Ronan Hunt\nFull Resolution: 3056x3056 pix, 1/1 Edition Jpeg\nImage Credit: Ronan Hunt\n\n",
