    "description": "City lights touch my skin\nI glow and shine\nAnd I always sin.\nThe city is where my heart stays\nEven when I live so far,\nMy heart sings for the noise\nMy eyes search for the stars.\nStrangers pass, we don't speak \nAnd our eyes never meet.\nI visit the big city\nTo feel beautiful and pretty\nTo see the vastness that we have\nTo feel the history of souls that have passed.\nYou see, these city streets\nThey talk to me\nConfirm my bias that\nWe should laugh and play\nAnd never, ever sleep.\nWhen life moves so fast\nI reflect while walking on the street,\nI ache for the memories that are past\nKnowing I will only love this city, my biggest feat.",
