    "description": "A Beeing comes in many shapes and colors. This is the most common type. Beeings are all about inclusivity, so much so that it's part of their biology. Beeings are capable of creating any kind of animal or Beeing called hybrids! Hybrids are just as much Beeings as most common type. Being a Beeing comes from the heart, not from your shell. This leaves room for a lot of creative appearances. Let's meet other Beeings below.\n\nOur collection consists of 10,000 uniquely created Beeings, with over 230+ traits, including a couple secret ones...\n\nEvery Beeing and trait has been digitally hand-drawn by Leon Karssen.",
