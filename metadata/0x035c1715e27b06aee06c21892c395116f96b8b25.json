    "description": "Solitude\n\n\nTogether, but alone. \nThat’s how I felt sharing this sunset with this person. It felt like it was just us in our own little world. Everyone just left and didn't wait or give the sunset a chance to burn. Everyone wants instant gratification. But not us.\n\n“Loneliness is the poverty of self; Solitude is the richness of self”\nUntil you can fully sit with yourself, you’ll feel if you’re lonely or in solitude. I savor the isolation, I crave it in order to reach out and form connection or even community..\nIt’s my recharge and necessary in order for me to show up for myself and others. We all yearn for it.\nSolitude, but not seclusion. \nThe relationship with ourselves and then the world around us. \nA home for your soul.\n\nThis moment captured for myself, but now for you. \n\n\nWaikiki Beach, Hawai’i.",
