    "description": "PNG Format, 300 DPI, 1920*2400 pixels\n\nThis piece, “The Reader'', is a reflection on the worlds of possibilities you stumble in when you read something. It’s not always about the thickest hardbound you can get your hands on. Even a 4 pane comic strip carries the power to fundamentally change you.\n\nIt is not that reading transports you, no. Rather it brings new worlds to you. The writers’ words are at the behest of your interpretation and what you make of them. And with those new worlds come new thoughts, values and possibilities. Reading doesn’t transport you, it transforms you.\n",
