    "name": "The Silent One",
    "description": "The initial incarnation from the last 10 former incarnations before becoming the enlightened one. Tmir descended once again in a Monarchy of the Kais Kras (Ruler of the Paras Na Zi Kingdom), he who descended with knowledge of his past life is in fear of being the heir of the ruler family. Not one word slips out of his mouth as he knows the path of becoming once again a King isnâ€™t what he is looking for. The silent one is what people acknowledge of him, forbidden to be the king by his pretentious disability, only himself knowing the true purpose. Just another step closer to being the enlightened one.    \n\nInspired by The Jataka tales (chah-dok in Thai) recount stories from some of the past lives of the beings who would eventually reach enlightenment as the Buddha.\n\n1/10 from collection\n3480 x 4000 px\n300 DPI\n",
