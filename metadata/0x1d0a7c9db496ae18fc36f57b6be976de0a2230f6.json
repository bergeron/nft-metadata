    "description": "\"An atom is composed of a positively charged nucleus, with a cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounding it, bound together by electrostatic force.\"\n\nOft times in our lives, we find ourselves surrounded by a cloud of negativity. \n\nThis is especially true as an artist. We put our work out there for the world to see with little expectation in return. Every detail is then examined and picked apart at a glance. The work that we poured hours, days, & weeks into, is dissected before our eyes. Many times the negativity is whispered behind closed doors. But like all forces in our lives, we can feel that energy.\n\nIt is those of us that can harness the negativity and embrace it, that will soar the highest.\n\nAs we rise above the noise with our newfound energy, the road ahead is lit up like a beacon to guide us to our destination. Our focus sharpens and our determination is forged like steel. \n\nWhat will you do when surrounded by negativity?\n\n I, for one, will embrace it and let it steer me further along my journey.",
