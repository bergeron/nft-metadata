    "description": "Exploring an ocean of incredibly complex and detailed patterns that might open new #BioGenArt perspectives.\n\nFew years ago, I looked for a process common to all different cultures, that could happen almost everywhere in the globe. A very repetitive process and absolutely unique at every iteration. Some would name it Â« Generative Â»\n\nI found the poster posters routine a good starting point: every second, in every cities, the same gesture is repeated, yet perpetuating a unique proposition. The iteration of a complex chain of decisions written by many parameters.\n\nWhat i felt both aesthetically and narratively relevant was to shot the remnants of the posters on the walls. I was excited by their innocence and purity. What looks unappealing on walls was actually incredibly attractive to me. A question of perspective.\n\nInvisibles and hidden under all marketing and mass manipulation, the remnants were the rebels, independent to our codes. But how the life itself could be hidden within algorithms. Could we find clues of the living inside the code?\n\nWith my friend Johan Lescure, we are now looking for more than a year poetic evidence of that immanence ðŸŒ±\n\n{Compend-AI-X} 2023 #1 is part of the Refraction Dao x Proof of People experience during NFT NYC 2023\n\n4096â€ŠÃ—â€Š4096  \nMpeg4  \n140mo\n\nSOUND ON !",
