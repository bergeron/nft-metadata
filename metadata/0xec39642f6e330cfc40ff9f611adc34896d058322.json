    "description": "A transitioning composite of two photographs--a sunrise and sunset--accompanied by the artist's original narrative.\n\n===\n\nI find joy in waking before dawn and waiting for first light.\n\nIf life is a series of sunrises and sunsets and no one knows exactly how many we get, then every new sunrise I have left can turn into my day...and my chance to get things right.\n\nAnd when the sun sets, I wonder if I did enough to deserve how it rose for me in the first place until I realize that a new day isn't a reward to earn, but a gift to cherish. \n\nSo I pause to look at the sky once more, the sun dimming to its last fiery hurrah, and say thank you for the light it brought me today, the life it gives, and the hope it will bring yet again: a new tomorrow.\n\nRaymond Lauchengco\n2022",
