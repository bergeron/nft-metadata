    "description": "Iceland is one of the most unforgettable place I have ever visited. It's one of a few countries where you will be able to experience the aurora borealis.\n\nThis photo was captured on my second trip to Iceland with four other photographers on the final day of our trip. During the whole trip, we have had a mixture of good and bad luck in terms of weather. But we never had any good luck throughout the trip, when it comes to clear sky at night. It meant that seeing the Northern light would be impossible if the sky stayed cloudy.\n\nWe checked weather forecast and waited every night hoping that the sky will clear up, but it wasn't until the final day that we have the lucky break through. As soon as sun had set and after our dinner, we went straight to different nearby locations to capture this beautiful phenomena. Skogafoss was one of many locations we stopped by to photograph the aurora borealis, witnessing the northern light dancing away was one of the most magical night of my life.",
