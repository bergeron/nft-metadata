    "name": "My doors in my mind",
    "description": "I cross several doors a day. My body doesn't actually move, but my mind rarely rests. Thoughts flying in without rules fill me up and fill the top of my head with a flickering breathing hole before I escape into a long, thin breath. My body sits still, but sometimes I want to lie down for a while after constantly thinking about it and making it. However, even if I lie down and close my eyes, other doors have not stopped waiting for me, so I constantly cross the doors. I think it took quite a long time to admit and accept that this is my life and life. As much as I admitted, there were more doors, and now I have the freedom to sing nasal songs. Even if I'm out of breath, I'm already waiting for another door that hasn't opened yet, thinking about how to catch my breath.\n\nI'm always full of new doors.\n\nhttps://munjikim.com",
