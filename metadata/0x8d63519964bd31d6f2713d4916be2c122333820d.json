    "description": "Gala Genesis consists of 60 unique 1/1s. All Genesis Holders will also receive a free airdrop from the Generative collection. Gala Grrrls were raised by the musical activists of the Riot Grrrl movement in the early 90s punk and rock scene. Gala Grrrls are now leading the subcultural movement into Web3 to raise awareness and continue the fight against physical and emotional violence against all genders. This movement supports all survivors of abuse and will provide educational tools to prevent future victims. Gala Grrrls combines the power of art and education to deliver compelling stories of strength, growth, and courage. Victims, survivors, and thrivers of all genders are welcome here.",
