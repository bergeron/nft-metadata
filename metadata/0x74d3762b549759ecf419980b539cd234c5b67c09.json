    "description": "Red London | Defender Savile Row. May 2019. I used to walk past this iconic corner every morning on my way to work and would often spot this impeccable Defender parked there. Just behind where I shot this is the building where the Beatles last played together live on the rooftop of what had been their Apple Corps HQ on January 30, 1969.",
