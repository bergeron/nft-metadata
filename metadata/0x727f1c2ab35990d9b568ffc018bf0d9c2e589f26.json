    "description": "For good reason, Acadia has been coined the crown jewel of the East Coast. The rocky shores carved out by the Atlantic are surrounded by pine tree forests. It is this landscape contrast that differentiates Acadia from the rest of the eastern seaboard. Maine has been a spot I find myself drawn to since I picked up a camera. Each visit brings a renewed sense of adventure - every time I come, I find another reason to contemplate packing up my bags and moving there for good. All 4 photos were taken on a myriad of iPhones ranging from iPhone 7 to iPhone 10.",
