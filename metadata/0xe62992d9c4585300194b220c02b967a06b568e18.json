    "description": "\"Fleeting Seasons\" is part of the series One collection, which focuses on the interconnection and inseparability of humanity and the natural world. This is my Genesis NFT marking my entry onto the blockchain. \n\nThe intricate texture suggests the many layers of our personality; our experiences accumulate like strata and give depth to who we are. Through their cracks and voids lies our essence, as exemplified by the protruding human face. The earthy textured fragments appear as symbols for the layers of our emotions, past memories, and the physical world which obscures our underlying consciousness. They are also a visual reminder of the natural world to which humans are intimately interconnected and that offers a window to further understand ourselves.\n\nIf the primary collector recognizes the woman depicted in this piece, the collector can claim free shipping on the purchase of the physical artwork.",
