    "description": "The Diesel x neuno Alpha Drop is comprised of up to 5,000 prototype sneaker NFTs. Minted on the Ethereum Blockchain, each sneaker membership exists as its own ERC-721 token. The NFT holders will unlock a ticket to an event and a DCL wearable of the sneakers. This drop was a gift from the Diesel team where minters only have to cover gas fees. This prototype NFT is a private mint available to neuCard holders, D:VERSE community and those that registered for the drop in November 2021.",
