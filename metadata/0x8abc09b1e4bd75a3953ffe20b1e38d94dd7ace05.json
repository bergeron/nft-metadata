    "description": "This image is of the historical Capitol Records building in Hollywood California. Also known as the \"House that Nat Built\", music artists like the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Elvis, The Beastie Boys, and more have recorded countless gold records since it was built in 1956. The building itself was designed to look like a stack of records on a turntable with the spindle pointing skyward. The image was given a scratched look to remind you of the days when you would listen to your favorite record over and over again giving it that beautiful sound only a record player can give.   ",
