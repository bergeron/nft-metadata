    "name": "Skin Deep",
    "description": "“Skin Deep” is a series of photographs with Augmented Reality that explores surface of thing – face - in relation to Asian shame culture through performing self-portraits. Chinese shame is rooted on the concept of face. Shame is used as a tool of social control and harmony, as a way to prevent citizens— especially women—from acting in ways that might disrupt the status quo. Dong creates a series of ID -card photographs by concealing her face in Chinese traditional silk fabrics. “Skin Deep” is an act of drawing back the curtain and pointing to the deeply embedded feelings of shame that can cause women to hold back and stay silent, transforming the performative gestures into experiences that are understood to be universal and relatable.",
