    "description": "When I think of passion, the first thing that comes to mind is the stamp on a wax paper packet of heroin. Passion bags were my favorite.\n\nToday, I'm passionate about being a good dad, creating design and art that makes me and hopefully others happy, being kind, working to be a better me, and not wasting my life.\n\nMinted December 28th of 2022 celebrating 25 years heroin free.\n\nDrawn in a sketchbook with pen in the 2000's and colored with scanned construction paper.",
