    "description": "Prothesis & Vanity\nphotography\n2022\nMegan Laurent\n\n\nWhat is this still-life ? \n\nI endured 5 years of having dentures for my teeth, so that I could speak, eat and present myself in public. This vanity is a self-portrait where I celebrate these prostheses that helped me live.\n\nIt is a vanity that also represents the fragility of my health, after years of reconstructive surgery on my upper jaw. This image reminds me that we can exclude people with health problems and create a boundary with them and able-bodied people.\n\nThe NFTfactory for this exhibition proposed to all the artists to work on the theme of Indigo, because this color has been excluded and sometimes even denied as an individual color, through the history of physics.\n\nBy analogy, the NFTFactoryParis wanted to raise the broader question of the capacity for inclusion in human society.\n\nThis work was exhibited for the exhibition \"Indigo - The Seventh Color\" organized by NFT Factory in Paris, France / from April to May 2023.",
