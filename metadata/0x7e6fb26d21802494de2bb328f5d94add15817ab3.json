    "description": "Akrasia is defined by Aristotle and Socrates as the state of acting against your better judgment. When you do one thing even when you know you should be doing something else. The human mind going against its own boundaries and thought processes. Or is it the mind going against preformed knowledge trying out a pathway into undiscovered territory?",
