    "description": "Famine is traditionally pictured riding a black horse and is popularly understood to be Famine as the Horseman carries a pair of balances or weighing scales, indicating the way that bread would have been weighed during a famine.\nSome authors also interpret the third Horseman as the \"Lord as a Law-Giver\" holding Scales of Justice.\nThe black color of the horse symbolizes \"lamentation for those who fell away from faith in Christ because of the severity of the torment”.\n\nAnd here in my own feminine interpretation of Famine. I decided to picture the scales as an engraving on the horse’s medallion. The scales are not real anymore, they have become only an ornament for decoration slightly reminding of the horrors that famine brings. Yes, I want to put existence of hope in every image of my Horsewomen.\n…\nHand drawn original digital painting",
