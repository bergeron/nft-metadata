    "description": "The digital collectible „Cliquita Bratanas - NEONREAL the gallery edition“ of the Cologne crew \"Non-Fungible Artwork\" (NFA) can only be claimed at the \"NEONREAL Art Gallery\" from 22nd of April to 31st of May 2023 in Düsseldorf, Burgplatz 2, Germany. \nOwning this digital collectible allows holders to get access to future community benefits such as whitelist spots, airdrops and other exclusive goodies. \n\nThe idea behind the \"Cliquita Bratanas\" animation is to humorously question the raison d'être of NFTs while digitally capturing the community spirit of the Gallery and immortalizing it as an NFT on the Blockchain.  \nThese bananas, originally penned by 3D artist Jan Pluimers, represent all NFA members, but can also be easily identified with anyone who can look at the NFT movement of recent years with a twinkle in their eye.\n\nNon-Fungible Artwork is an association of creative minds and digital pioneers from Cologne. Founded by Marco Sohn and Andreas Fabritius, who both have their roots in the audio-visual industry, film and advertising. \n\nAll NFA crew members come from the fields of VFX, 2D, 3D, animation, motion design, sound design, composition and music production and have worked for the biggest brands, major labels, Netflix and Hollywood. \n\nNFA's goal is to create cross-media art and make it accessible to a selective audience using blockchain technology\n\nAuthors:  \nMarco Sohn  \nJan Pluimers  \nAndreas Fabritius\n\nSupported by: Flux Collective  \nNEONREAL the gallery",
