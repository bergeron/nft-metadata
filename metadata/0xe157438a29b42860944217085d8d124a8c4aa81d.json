    "description": "Hi, I'm Faramarz, a barista who loves coffee and giving people a good feeling\nI made a video for myself several times\nFrom 16 hours of work, I first wanted to post it on Instagram, but when I saw the deep feeling of the video, I burst into tears , seeing how beautiful it feels to see people feel good.\nI decided to make a time-lapse and convert the film to 4 minutes NFT\n\nWhen I saw this world pays a lot for worthless things\nI wanted to see what is price of 16 hours of good feeling\n.......\n\nDue to upload restrictions\nI had to upload a preview on site, original video was almost 700mb and it is impossible to upload on foundation.\nI will send the original 4 minutes version of the video to anyone who buy this NFT",
