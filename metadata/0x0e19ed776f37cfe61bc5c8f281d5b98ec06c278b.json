    "description": "We see colorful landscapes in every corner of this work!  Everything in the world has a color, and if it doesn't have a color, it doesn't have a soul.  But among all these colors, there is a world beyond any belief, whose colors are like 24 different colored pencils and patterns like carpets!  Being a girl is a world as hard as stone and as soft as feathers! Erika is a dignified and magnificent girl with obvious innocence on her face, who enchants everyone.",
