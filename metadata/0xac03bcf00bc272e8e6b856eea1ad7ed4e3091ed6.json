    "description": "Culture lag refers to the time that elapses between the introduction of a new item of material culture and its acceptance as part of nonmaterial culture (Ogburn 1957).\n\nIn the midst of decolonization efforts, explorations into Indigenous ritual currencies & excitement into Afrofuturist methods of timekeeping...perhaps it's time to ask: \n\nWhat do ancestral navigation devices for pilgrimage look like? \n\nIn this project, I work with the latest AI software to imagine iterative visions based off of my work in divination, AI ethics and blockchain.\n\nWhat does the technology of our descendants look like, and how do we operate it? What kind of tools exist in an interfaith, sustainable, multicultural PanAfrican future - and which ones will help us get there?\n\nI dream of a future where beads & astrolabes are once again revolutionary technologies. ProtoBead 01 is a ritual interface prototype for the future world I'm manifesting. \n\nCollectors help that dream to become rooted in the material world.",
