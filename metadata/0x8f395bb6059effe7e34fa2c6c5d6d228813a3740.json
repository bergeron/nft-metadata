    "description": "\"Moving Dwelling\" is a collection of 3500 unique NFTs generated by eighteen and sixteen-year-old brothers from Mongolia. The project they created is based on Mongolian culture. “Ger” – has been the main style of dwelling for Mongolians and the historical icon of The Mongol Empire of the 13th century, which was the largest empire that covered the entire landmass of Eurasia. Also, ‘ger’ is characterized that it has been passed down from generation to generation of ancient tribes that rose and fell throughout history. In the 21st century, you can own the modern ‘Ger’ of Genghis Khan as a non-fungible token from this collection. So, which one will be yours?",
