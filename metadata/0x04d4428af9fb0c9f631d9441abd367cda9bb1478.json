    "description": "He waited for hours, hoping to hear three simple words. But they never came. He felt his heart breaking as he watched the raindrops fall, each one a reminder of the pain he was feeling. He had loved her so much, and he thought she felt the same. But she had said no, and it all came crashing down around him. He couldn't help but cry in the rain, the anguish and sadness too much for him to bear. He knew it was over, but he couldn't understand why.\n\n----------------------------\n1256px x 1536px\nNo AI was used. \nmade in Blender 3d software.",
