    "description": "My main principles as an artist are to surprise, awe, & delight an audience. I aimed to create a piece that was surprisingly resonant, awe inspiring in spectacle, and delightfully funny & absurd.\n\nThis piece is also a love letter to the musical genre, with much of the production design, composition, and choreography being inspired by classic Hollywood musicals. \n\nI felt that this piece could potentially tap into a certain cultural zeitgeist if done properly. My goal was to create a piece of art that could ride the line of being both a meme and fine art. I hoped that the commentary on the cartoonish levels of power that billionaires like Jeff Bezos wield in our society, wrapped in a glitzy & absurd animation, could strike a chord and profoundly resonate with a large audience.\n\nThis piece is the grand finale of the collection.\n\nCreated primarily using the 3D software Houdini/Redshift.\n\nAll Copyrights released under CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.",
