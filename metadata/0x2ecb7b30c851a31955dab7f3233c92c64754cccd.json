    "description": "Evolution \nOrigami whose shape I interpret to be a horse, which grows to be big, regarding money seems to be in line with what we know so far, as a medium of exchange which we know since our childhood. \n\nParody\nIce cream shop turned into a development place for blockchain technology, Bitcoin was the pioneer, ETH became the most important and valuable asset afterwards. \n\nAnother Story \nAir Ballon feels more appropriate to be used than the plane to tell another story. We know that money is a medium of exchange and blockchain is a new technology for currency, and other stories are being carried by air balloons somewhere.\n\n-\n20fps\n2048x2773px\ngif loop animation.",
