    "description": "Honey bees create hexagonally structured comb, that maximizes their storage capacity. Each cell is used to its full potential, acting as a multi-purpose nursery for eggs & larva, and then being filled with flower nectar & pollen from within a 2 mile radius of the hive. Their queen works diligently, laying upwards of 1000 eggs per day, and colonies can house around 60,0000 individuals, which are 99% females!",
