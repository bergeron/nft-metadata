    "description": "Winter In Suburbia is a photographic collection focused on suburban/rural scenes overtaken by winter conditions. Soft blankets of snow, roads in rough driving condition... these images capture the aftermath of the harsh weather many American suburban communities experience. With low contrast, cool-toned processing and wider compositions that exaggerate empty space, these images bring viewers into the scenes, viewers are forced to experience the silence that spans across these winter-scapes.",
