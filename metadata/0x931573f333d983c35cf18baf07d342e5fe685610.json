    "description": "Who are Picasso(s) of the Prado More relevant than Goya Pinpoints of the bombing Of consciousness Saints and chimney sweepers Fondling their sacks of blood \n\nWho are Picasso(s) of glands More urgent than Delacroix Unhinged doors of libraries And prisons Engorged nipples Choking their models \n\nFire is the Basque capital Of protest Monday through Sunday Flags systematically The blasphemes of power And privilege \n\nPicasso(s) for the thirteen manifeÂ­ Stations of the double cross In this Apocalyptic Warhouse... Not a speak Easy not at all \n",
