    "description": "about the image: u is for unchartered. the purity of the untouched snow covering the dark volcanic rock made me appreciate how privileged i was to be one of the only people capturing these magical scenes in these conditions.\n\nabout the collection: vetur is a minimal, abstract, aerial series capturing icelandic landscapes in the winter. the abstractness of the textures & lines make for compelling compositions, and are inherently unique images due to either myself (in a helicopter) or a drone i am piloting, being suspended in the air at varying altitudes & positions. this type of photography can provide a sense of calm and a connection to the natural world, evoking a deep emotional response. it can also inspire appreciation for the beauty & delicate balance of the environment.\n\nabout the artist: Johnathan Conlon is a published, award winning photographer specialising in landscape & aerial imagery.\n\nvetur : image 4 in a series of 6. \nlicence : extended editorial.",
