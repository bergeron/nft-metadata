    "description": "‘OG PAL’ was the first outcome of the collaboration between Oleg Soroko & Michael Pryor (ekim), known collectively as ‘SoProcedural’.\n\nThe objective was to develop a highly detailed unique character creation system with SideFX Houdini which was fully procedural, with no manual 3d modeling.\n\nThis character creation system has been in development since 2021 and is continually being improved with the goal of enabling the mass creation of truly unique 1 of 1 game ready characters for the metaverse at the click of a button.\n\nEach edition minted of ‘OG PAL’ may be used for future burns to claim new art and other surprises by SoProcedural.\n\n*disclaimer: not associated with our Wilder World drops",
