    "description": "This lion, affectionately named \"Big Boy\" was the pride of the Schotia Wildlife Reserve for 20 years. He may well be the most photographed lion in South Africa as the Schotia Wildlife Reserve had over 8000 international tourists viewing him and his pride each year.\n\nI had the privilege of photographing this handsome lion in January of 2020 during a beautiful sunset on the reserve. He looked at me so majestically, I was incredibly happy to get this shot of him in such perfect lighting.\n\nUnfortunately on November 22nd of 2020 he passed away. He had lived a long life on the reserve. He was pretty ill during his last year and the other members of his pride let him feed on their kills.\n\nThis lion has a massive impact on people over the years. He was truly the King of Schotia.",
