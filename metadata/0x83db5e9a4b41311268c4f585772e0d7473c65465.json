    "description": "Day 7 - Trip\n\nA boy is having an adventure with its companion horse. They are on a trip to find a treasure.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA collection for the Inktober 2022 challenge. This year I chose acrylic paints to work on the official prompts provided by the challenge organizer.\n\nThe purpose of this collection is to give an opportunity for my collectors to get a hold of a physical art piece by Blooming Visions.\n\nEverything is painted with acrylics on 297 x 420 mm paper. Artworks will be shipped straight to your post office, box or home!",
