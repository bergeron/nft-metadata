    "description": "This multiple exposure photograph was made somewhere along the N1 highway â€“ the section that slices through the semi-arid moonscape of the Klein Karoo. It was the first day of a week-long photographic adventure I had planned months in advance... and I was lost. I'd missed the turnoff to Laingsburg sixty or seventy kilometres back.\n\nFrustrated, but determined not to let it derail my time-sensitive plans, I decided to at least take one photograph before turning the car around. So I loaded the camera, stepped out on to the side of the road, and exposed the first frame of my first roll of film.\n\nI shot hundreds of photographs during that trip, but 10 years hence this is probably my favourite of all of them. In fact, I ended up selecting it as the poster image for my 'Transcendental Wayfaring' exhibition in London later that same year. \n\nThe original 35mm negative has been scanned at 8000ppi on an Imacon 949 scanner, for maximum detail and colour depth in its digital form on the blockchain.",
