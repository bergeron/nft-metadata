    "description": "This photo belongs to a collection from a trip I made through Mexico, the US, and Bali between 2017 and 2018.\nThey are very significant to me, as they represent an achievement of a lifetime dream.\nI grew up in a small beach town in Argentina, and as a kid, I always dreamt about traveling the world.\nWhen I finished my studies in sound recording and music production, I worked for a whole year and traveled for the first time by myself to Brasil in 2009.\nIn 2011, together with my twin brother, we went from Buenos Aires to Perú in search of waves and mystic mornings.\nAt the age of 26, I hopped first time on a plane with one of my best friends to the US. We worked in California for several months, and then I spent the holidays in Playa del Carmen, México.\nAfter the summer, I returned to California and got the opportunity to visit SoCal and NYC.\nIn July of that same year, we jumped to Bali with my brother and friends for 2 and 1/2 months.\nA year went by.\n",
