    "description": "FINDING THE FRAME\nMy inspiration comes from various sources and that too, quite infrequently. The idea to shoot this frame struck me initially when I saw a movie song in 2011. But for some reason, I didn't pursue it then.\n\nLater in 2017, I happened to see a music video, and the plan to shoot it ideated in my mind again. With the help of a friend who is a native of this area, I got coordinates to an otherwise unpopular beach where this cargo ship is sand-trapped.\n\nABOUT THE PHOTO\nAfter trying out different frames, I decided to shoot at this angle to include the foreground and bring in some depth. As I was shooting a long exposure, composing with more of the foreground seemed to be a better idea to show the smooth transition of waves.\n\nENDNOTE\nFor someone who loves experimenting with long exposures, this was undoubtedly worth a try. Although it took a few tries, when this photograph was finally made, I was content.\n\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 3000x4500\nLocation: Kollam, Kerala / India",
