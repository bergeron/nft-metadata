    "description": "The Doors of Tbilisi NFT has been issued as a unique edition. \n\nPhoto: 4760 x 6208 px\n\nThe historic district of Sololaki in Georgian capital Tbilisi was being built up in the mid XIX century - beginning of the XX century. It was populated by wealthy people mostly hence the district’s diverse and elegant architecture. \n\nToday it’s just remnants of those luxurious facades and entrance halls nevertheless it’s still a delight exploring them. \n\nMurals and wall carvings, marble floors, elaborated staircases and doors of course… It seems impossible to find two similar doors in the district, they all were fabricated in style and with attention to detail. \n",
