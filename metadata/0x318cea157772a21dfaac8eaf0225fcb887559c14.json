    "description": "There is a belief in many cultures that the act of expressing one's wishes and dreams, whether through writing them down or sharing them with others, can help to make those wishes and dreams come true. This belief is likely at the heart of the Chinese flying lamp tradition, as the act of attaching a written wish to a lantern and releasing it into the air is seen as a way of bringing that wish closer to fruition. In this way, the tradition of releasing flying lanterns can be seen as a symbolic representation of a person chasing their dreams. By expressing their hopes and aspirations in this way, and letting go of the lantern, the person is figuratively letting go of their fears and doubts, and allowing their dreams to take flight.",
