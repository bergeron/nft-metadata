    "description": "**Reinebringen** is one of the most popular hikes in Norway, and for good reason.  It affords 360-degree views of much of the Lofoten island chain, as well as the towns of Reine and Hamn√∏y far, far below.  \n  \nAlthough this hike was short in length and duration, it was very steep, and oh so slippery!  We got to the top exhausted, thankful for intact ankles, and took in the sights.  The distant jagged peaks resembled teeth biting the horizon, and the vertigo-inducing views were a reward in and of themselves.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Artist:**  Steve Walasavage  \n**Series:**  Non-Fungible Travels  \n**Collection:**  Norway Up High  \n**Edition:**  1/1 NFT  \n  \n---  \n\nAbout *Norway Up High*:  \n  \nNorway... The land of trolls and fjords.  Diverse landscape of islands, mountains, beaches, forests, and glaciers. Friendly people, but sometimes unforgiving weather.  Any photographer's paradise, any traveler's must-visit destination, and any hiker's trekking dream...  \n  \nAbout ten months after my wife and I got married, we visited fabulous Norway on our honeymoon.  We'd been talking about it for years, and we had the time off, so why not make a trip out of it?  But this wasn't going to be the typical lavish newlywed vacation, no...  We planned an epic three-week journey to the north of the country and back, camping and hiking all along the way!  \n  \nNorway Up High is my own take on a travel memoir. These hikes and viewpoints were the first time I was surrounded by this much natural beauty, and my fondest memories of it were all from the highest points we reached. Join me as I show you ten of my favorite vertiginous views!\n\nEach NFT in this collection is a 1/1 edition.  \n  \n---  \n  \nExtended Editorial License:  Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
