    "description": "Silver Lining is a special image that shows how one can see a glimpse of light even through dense clouds. Silver Lining is about hope. It gives strength to hold on, despite all odds.  \nThis image was of “Chaar Chinar”, located in the Dal Lake, Srinagar. The name literally means “Four Maple Trees”. It got its name from the total number of Maple Trees on the small island. The trees started rotting and dying because of the impact of floods and public apathy. Something which once was an iconic landmark was dying a slow death. When it came to its last stage, with two trees totally damaged and the remaining two looking like rudiments, the nature conservation authorities decided to replant one full grown tree as an experiment and that experiment seems to have been successful.  \nThe Govt now plans to re-plant 3 more trees to restore the place to its full glory. \nThis is a fine art image, that I did processing to signify my thoughts about this place. Dark all around with divine glow - that SILVER LINING in the center.",
