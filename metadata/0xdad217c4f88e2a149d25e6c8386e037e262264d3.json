    "description": "Pride (superbia) is considered the original and most serious of the seven deadly sins. It is the most angelical or demonic out of them.\nIt is also thought to be the source of the other capital sins, known as hubris or futility. It is identified as dangerously corrupt selfishness, the putting of one's own desires, urges, wants, and whims before the welfare of other people.\nPride has been labeled the father of all sins and has been deemed the devil's most prominent trait.\nPride is the \"anti-God\" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God.\nit was through Pride that the devil became the devil. Pride leads to every other vice.\n",
