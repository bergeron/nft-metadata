    "name": "Mother and Child",
    "description": "In the shadowed cradle of creation,\nLies a force of adoration,\nA love profound, its tender grasp,\nThe whispered breath of life's first gasp.\n\nA mother's heart, so full, complete,\nNurtures life, with love replete,\nHer warmth and care, a soothing balm,\nIn stormy seas, she is the calm.\n\nYet in the dark, a force does linger,\nGently coiled around her finger,\nThe twisted strings of love and power,\nEntwined as one, both sweet and sour.\n\nA mother's love, unyielding, strong,\nCan shape the young, both right and wrong,\nHer touch, her voice, her gentle stare,\nA double-edged sword, a love so rare.\n\nWith every morsel of her being,\nShe seeks to guide, protect, and glean,\nBut oftentimes, the purest love,\nBecomes the shackle, the weighted glove.\n\nFor in the depths of night, it shows,\nA love that blooms, yet overthrows,\nThe silent dance of shadows cast,\nA mother's love, both first and last.\n\nCollaboration with @LeafSwan",
