    "description": "Focusing on a dialectic system, Crespo’s work additionally leads the viewer towards revisiting the history of natural science. In conjunction with the digital work, she offers a handmade cyanotype. First created in 1842, a cyanotype is a slow-reacting photographic printing process that produces a cyan-blue print, popularised by Anna Atkins in her publication Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions (1843). Crespo’s approach of hand-making each cyanotype preserves historical recording methods and pays tribute to leading women in the natural sciences.\n\n[Collector receives 1x1m handmade cyanotype print on fine cotton, framed]",
