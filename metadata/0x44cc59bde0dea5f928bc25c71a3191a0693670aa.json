    "description": "MetaGems are unique crystals that consist of elements from different planets as well as Androths ether ground. They’re a valuable resource and our community has the secret to collect and use them in our blockchain metaverse called Androth. Once extracted, you can use your MetaGems in our Role play to earn cross-platform games. You also can increase its rarity with our ERC20 token ($Dustz) and gain yielding on your HODL. If you’re looking to make a quick profit you may also trade your MetaGems to other collectors looking to complete certain quests in the metaverse. Every MetaGems represents an essential piece to unlock rewards (NFT, $Dustz or Ethereum) in our games. We will be launching several games with hundreds of quests. The more quests you complete, the greater your rewards will be.",
