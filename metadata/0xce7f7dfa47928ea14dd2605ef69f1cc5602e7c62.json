SCHAT designs the unconscious cyborg Catrix into the first prototype, where the narrative proceeds to develop over several different metaverses. When Catrix finally comes to, she has no knowledge of who she is or where she is, and she is totally clueless to the setting in which she finds herself. Catrix sets out on a trip to learn about life in several domains so that she might uncover her identity and, eventually, seem to be a real person. Catrix embarks on this adventure at a time when she is still getting used to her new life and the treacherous streets of several different metaverses.",
