    "description": "This beautiful display of the aurora borealis happened on Lofoten islands in Norway, back in 2017.\n\nShort story how I took this photograph:\nIn fact I was on the location (Skagsanden beach) early in the evening (around 21:00), while still another group of photographers was also there to shoot. But there were no northern lights visible yet. After two hours they all left, and I had the beach all to myself. And of course then the show started.\n\nBeing alone on a beach during a cold night, with this sky overhead, is the reason why I love landscape photography.",
