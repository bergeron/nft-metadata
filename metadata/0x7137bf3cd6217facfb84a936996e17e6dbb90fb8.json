    "description": "\nthis is a sacred song that came down during the venus cazimi on 10-22-22. \n\ncazimi originates from the Arabic term for ‚Äúin the heart of the Sun‚Äù ‚Äî an enchanted state when a planet is within 1 degree of the Sun.\n\nthat night, infinite i setup a pop-up studio on venus st. the production was already a flowing dream, i suggested we add claps & the synth guitars at the end. \n\ni finished writing honey while in spiritual retreat with my family where the ocean meets the river. honey calls in the renewal of sweetness. may sweetness stick to you and may it cover your words, self-talk, and actions as we remember that sound vibrates as a force. \n\nCHRMLTD drops are spiritual downloads and cosmic messages. Think of them like rare gems, honey is the first of a few rare limited edition drops emerging in 2023, i hope it makes into the hands of those who will benefit from the message the most. \n\nin unity, peace, and goddess pop\n\n<3 queen charm\n\n\n\n\n",
