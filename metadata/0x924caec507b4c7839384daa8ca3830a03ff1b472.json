    "name": "Sea Of Tranquility",
    "description": "When the pain is processed, when the thoughts are done, and when the ghosts are gone, there is a sense of tranquility. It is a sense that the calm is a sea at peace. It is not anchored to anything other than itself, yet it is so vast that it is as stable as a rock.\n\nThere is always something more, nature has to offer to us. This particular place in southern India is one such wonderful rejuvenation. Just being there brings the soul into sweet surrender, at one with nature, vibrant yet relaxed. Thoughts and feet wander, lungs fill, and time rolls by in its silent and endless way.\n\n1/1 Edition\n\n\nAbout Artist: Sujan is an aspiring photographer from India. He is into Figurative Photography, Landscape, and Street photography. He believes the best gear one can have is one's eyes towards an excellent imagination to capture the hidden emotion in frames around us.\n",
