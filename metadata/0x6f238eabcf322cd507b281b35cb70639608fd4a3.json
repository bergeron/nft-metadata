    "description": "In a March 31, 2021 interview with television host Rachel Maddow, bartender turned Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said that the U.S. could “realistically” need to spend $10 trillion over the next 10 years to “create tens of millions of good union jobs in this country, that can shore up our health care, our infrastructure, our housing, and doing it in a way that draws down our carbon emissions.”\n\nShe went on to say, “I know that may be an eye-popping figure for some people, but we need to understand that we are in a devastating economic moment.”\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez does not mention, is the effect that such an expenditure would have on inflation, the U.S. economy, or the U.S. Dollar.\n\nThis piece of political parody illustrates the likely impact of AOC’s plan.\n\nArtists \nBillie Halliday\nMarc Caisip",
