    "description": "Landing with tense hands on an invisible platform of fleeting clarity. Breath shortens, seems irregular (when was it regular?), a thousand possible directions present themselves at once. Each one capable of occupying tens of hundreds of hours. Silence descends, the filter tightens, a path is chosen. Until the next fork, confidence is enjoyed.\n\nA study on the confusion, anxiety, and joy that is part of the creative flow. Oftentimes perception of the physical body and space is lost during the process. When the final touches are made, the artist is left to contemplate not only the finished piece, but the new state the artist is in as well. Each creation is a metamorphic event for all involved. \n\nCreated using Blender, Audacity and Processing.  \n2023",
