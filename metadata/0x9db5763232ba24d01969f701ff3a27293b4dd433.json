    "description": "The world has been sundered. It cries out in pain. I must come to its aid. \n\nUnto me is charged the great task of keeping the purity of time. Know that there is only one true timeline, though there are those who would have it otherwise. I must protect it. Without the truth of time as it is meant to unfold, more will be lost than you can possibly imagine.\n\nThe fabric of reality will unravel. It is a heavy task - the base of all tasks of this world, for nothing can transpire without time.",
