    "description": "In recent years Cancun has become a frequent destination for me. In each trip I make I discover a crowd of all nationalities, social classes, styles. A small universe unfolds in front of me, while hundreds, if not thousands of tourists leave their routines to enjoy their vacations. It is incredible to see how human beings spread out on this beach, so modest in other circumstances.\n\nNothing interests me more than the faces, the gestures, the looks, the postures, the ways of walking. I have spent many years observing these tourists. Some go, others come, but the essence of those who travel remains.\n\nThese photos bring that essence to me, a single click is enough to find many situations: the smell of sun lotion, volleyballs, sea castles, bachelorette parties, pi√±a coladas, children screaming, henna tattoos, heat, liberation... life.",
