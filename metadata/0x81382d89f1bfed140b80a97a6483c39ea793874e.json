    "description": "The Amur Leopard is the 1st art piece of our latest collection: \"Who will thrive when we're gone?\"\n\nAbout The Collection:\nThe planet will survive us. But it will look very different when we're gone.\nA collective of Artists and AI depict species threatened by humanity's impact on the planet, and pose the question: \"Who will thrive when we're gone?\"\n\nIf you think the latest NFT you bought is rare:\nThe Amur Leopard is Critically Endangered. There are only around 84 known individuals of their species left.\n\n\n\nNote: we are offsetting the environmental impact of any blockchain transactions we make on this platform, and a large portion of our profits are donated towards species conservation efforts made by the WWF.",
