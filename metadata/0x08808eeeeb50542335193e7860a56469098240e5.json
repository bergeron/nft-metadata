    "description": "\"Vision of 2023\" is the first Electric Waveâ€™s compilation and NFT collection that is pushing boundaries for electronic music into web3.\n    As the scene expands, Music NFTs are gaining more and more traction, and we believe that the music industry is going to be changed forever by this technology; also, digital collectibles will create a unique relationship between creatives and fans.\n    Vision of 2023 is going to be the first web3 project for Electric Wave and his artists. We are going to build a solid relationship between artists and collectors, which is the most important thing in this market, and, at the same time, the hardest to achieve.",
