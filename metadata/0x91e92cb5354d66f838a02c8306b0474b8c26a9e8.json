    "description": "Humankind wants to see everything perfect and sculpt it until it is perfect again.\nDue to its nature, it does not choose to fill in the gaps and accept what is as it is.Humankind are helpless and ignorant enough to think they can control everything. Underneath that arrogant state lies a great helplessness.Does not know how to be grateful.When in trouble, remembers creators and begs to get rid of the animosity.If the habits rule the person, that person will never improve and remain in the same life cycle. Ambitions,ego,wars and the desire to dominate pollute the purity of their souls. Impurity and sins are the evil that runs through the veins of man.\n\nHumanity, forgetting its ancestors and the ancient way, will be punished collectively not individually.People succumbed to inherent pleasures.\n\nMajestic Anomaly; the end or creation of humanity.Came from the earth and returned to the earth. This is the beginning of an end.It is the thing that destroys itself while trying to create itself.\n",
