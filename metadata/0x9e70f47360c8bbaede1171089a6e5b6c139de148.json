    "description": "α The Beginning\n\nThe Metaverse is a 2nd layer scaling solution to 3 Dimensional Reality. \nMetaverse, a Reflection of 3D Reality itself.\n3D Reality is already a reflection of the higher Dimensions.\nThis means the Metaverse is just a different way to have more computational power and extend 3D reality. We should be aware that higher planes and levels of Dimensions might be beyond Death itself.\nConsciousness is always connected to higher Dimensions of existence and can retain even higher levels. 5D -> ∞",
