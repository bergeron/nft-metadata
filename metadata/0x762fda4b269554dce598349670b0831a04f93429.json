    "description": "A free to claim mint dedicated to my dad. Edition size of 73, his age at the time of his passing. Growing up, I would watch him draw circuits, build and solder, invent and experiment. Admiring his oscilloscope, his piles of resistors, transistors, transformers, and boards. It always felt like he was building robots. This piece uses elements from one of his patents.\n\nHe was the first person to tell me to pay attention to blockchain. Unfortunately, I took his advice too late and we never got the chance to discuss in depth but I can now see what excited him so much.",
