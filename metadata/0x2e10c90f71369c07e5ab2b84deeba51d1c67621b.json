    "description": "\nMy university friends and I went on an out-of-town vacation to shoot nature around three years ago, when I was a photography student. When we came to a halt on the road at night, everyone turned to one side to look for the desired subject. I was gazing at the moon in the sky at the time, and wherever I walked, I glanced up (and nearly fell to the ground multiple times) until the moment I saw it, a demon-like visage emerged amid the mountain formations, and I couldn't believe my eyes. I could see the moon in what I assumed was his eye with a slight movement. This shot was a turning point in my life when I learned that there is a magic in nature that will reveal itself if you search hard enough.\n\n3870x2586 px/ jpg",
