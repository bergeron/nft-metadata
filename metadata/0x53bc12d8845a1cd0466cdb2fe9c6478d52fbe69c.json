    "description": "The Fake Banksy Punks is a collection of 10,000 unique 3D hyper-realistic Pop art photographic NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain.  Today, mainstream, and social media networks have become our primary sources of staying current in world events, these key platforms have chosen to manipulate and present misinformation as facts while concealing and covering up the truth. When the truth has been buried six feet underground there would be no difference between a Real and a Fake one, so the only thing which remains would be a dirty dirty dirty lie. Fake Banksy Punks is a Graffiti/Pop-art combo collection that represents our protest of mainstream and social media manipulation/disinformation and the negative impacts on humanity. Join our revolution against this madness. When we became one, they won't dare to ignore us anymore<3  NOTE: This collection is a photo-collaged contemporary/pop culture NFT project which pays homage to Banksy, Andy Warhol and CryptoPunks. It is not affiliated with Bansky, Andy Warhol or Larva labs. However, Fake Banksy Labs is a community-driven NFT lab (under CiCKartworks label) featuring art by CiCK (The anonymous crypto-artist behind I AM NOT BANKSY, DISOBEYPUNKS, Punkedups and ElonMonst).",
