    "description": "Look around the world\nthat in the bedclothes of his broken sleep\nIt is alien to itself.\n\nAnd look at us,\nAwake\nthat we are conscious of our own sorrow;\n\nAngry and aggressive\nWe guard our bitter sorrow,\nWe are the sullen guardians of our suffering\nso that it does not make a mistake from the black frame of the task that we have drawn around it.\n\nAnd look at the world\nthe world\nIn the innocent slumber of its sleep;\nWhat a stranger to himself!\n\nThe month passes\nAt the end of its cold circuit.\n\nWe are left and\nThe day will not come.\nA.Bamdad",
