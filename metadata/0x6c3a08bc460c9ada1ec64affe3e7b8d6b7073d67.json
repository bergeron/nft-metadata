    "description": "When I saw this tree from the distance, I immediately knew that it will be perfect to capture.\n\nI wanted a very minimalist composition to give it all the attention. The cloudy sky offers a gentle light and soft shadows, every part of the tree is visible.\n\nThat day, I took several shots with different wavelengths. I kept this one for the bold red color that gives a strong character to the final image. \n\nA strong character that this tree needs!\n\nInfrared photography is about looking beyond what we see, into the invisible. It's about revealing another version of the landscape around us. So, how does it look in visible light?
