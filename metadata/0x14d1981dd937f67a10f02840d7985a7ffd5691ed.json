    "description": "Looking at the stars at night has always been one of the things that I enjoy the most. And to be able to see the MilkyWay with your naked eye is amazing. Now that I can shoot the night sky with my camera is incredible how many stars you can capture in a single photo. This shot was taken in Switzerland and even when this shot is a composite I decided to use the MilkyWay in the background to showcase the lone tree as how small things are in this gigantic universe. Hope you feel connected with the cosmos as much as I do",
