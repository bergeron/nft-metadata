    "description": "In the search and quest of a sentient AI.\n\nSentient is described as the ability to perceive or feel things and is frequently used to contrast sapient. Basl argues that sentient AI would have a minimal level of consciousness. It may be aware of its surroundings, have good or negative attitudes, such as feeling pain or wishing to avoid feeling pain, and have wants.\n\nWhat exactly is a Sentient AI? Sentience = self-awareness; human-level intelligence; Turing-test-passing artificial intelligence Sentient AI's Possibility. \n\nThere are several conceivable implementations of artificial consciousness, as there are numerous proposed varieties of consciousness. Perhaps the most prevalent classification of consciousness in the philosophical literature is into \"access\" and \"phenomenal\" varieties. Access consciousness is concerned with those parts of experience that can be grasped.\n\nSoon it will be just up to us to answer all that. Make Your mark in History.  ",
