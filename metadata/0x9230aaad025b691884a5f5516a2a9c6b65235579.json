    "description": "Radial shadows\n\nOsaka station where many people cross. This day was also crowded with people, but by chance suddenly the number of people decreased and a circle was formed ! It was a dramatic moment with the sun at the center and shadows extending radially. We are in the same boat, even if we are going in different directions. While helping each other, we want to overcome the difficulties of the coming era.\n\nDate: July 23, 2022 Osaka Station, Osaka, Japan",
