    "description": "In 1996 David Hammons created an artwork titled \"Too Obvious\" displaying a broken piggy bank overflowing with cowries. These shells from Africa were once used as a traditional form currency. Hammons is a hero of mine & the art world as a whole.\n\nCreated in the madness of 2020, I was struggling to create my senior year of undergrad, while the world was falling apart around me. I turned to alcohol to cope & it landed me even lower, mentally and financially, than I was before.\n\n5691x3846 4.5MB",
