    "description": "The hot blazing summer sun starts to dip below the horizon as the lower atmosphere kicks up dust and drops a sprinkle of rain on to the harsh mallee landscape. The faintest of lightning strikes streaks across the sky as the fleeting storm moves across the wheat fields.\n\nChasing storms at this time of the day is something I love to do. When you have water in the atmosphere it is reflecting all over as the sun starts to hit all of the drops producing an abundance of reds, yellows and oranges. The golden glow I was getting here was absolutely stunning!\n\n",
