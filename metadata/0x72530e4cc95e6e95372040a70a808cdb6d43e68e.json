    "description": "A unique, 1 of 1, hand painted piece by Raouf Rifaï in 2020 - Acrylic on Canvas. Signed at the bottom. The first ever NFT minted by Rifaï and forms the genesis of the Darwish NFT series to come out soon. (Original painting safely guarded at the workshop and will never be sold). \n\n Who is the Darwish?  \n The Darwish may be anybody, the man in the street, me, you, him, as well as the man with political, economical, social, religious or cultural power. It makes no difference. The essence of the Darwish is universal and multifaceted. He or she can adopt any disguise equally. They suffer from double chair syndrome: they are not quite alive, not quite dead, they are undead social zombies, not quite here, not quite there, not quite on the chair, not quite on the other. That is why the Darwish is ready to make himself blind, deaf and dumb rather than face the reality of his inner bankruptcy, of his inability to solve the identity dilemma. He is adept at concealing his feelings, thoughts and emotions to remain in what is the acceptable line to his mind.",
