    "description": "The work does not express the subject realistically at all. This expression enhances the abstraction of the object and imprints it in the memory. In other words, it makes the object remembered for a long time by expressing the discarded (forgotten) in a simple form with strong abstraction. When the artist expresses an object by increasing abstraction with a simple shape, she already senses the physiological phenomenon that will occur in the reception of the image.\n\n#NFTart  #green  #landscape  #physical-based",
