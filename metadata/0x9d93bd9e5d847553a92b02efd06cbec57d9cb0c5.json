    "description": "“Breathe life, for you are the first and the only one. Bearer and witness to the burdens of creation.  Let your heart feel the endlessness of the universe.  For you shall both marvel and abhor what must conspire, drown and resurface to endure, for you are EMPATHIA.”\n\nTraditional charcoal artwork on which the  right side of the face was  redrawn digitally via procreate. Left side was intentionally left on its original state to inspire other traditional artists that we can adapt to the new age.\n\nThe book will be released this year. Im compelled to tell their stories; the angels, the fall and the greatest lie even divinity doesn't know of. \n\nBuyer will have the original artwork, a signed copy of the book and one of the manuscripts. \n\nwww.natarki.com\n",
