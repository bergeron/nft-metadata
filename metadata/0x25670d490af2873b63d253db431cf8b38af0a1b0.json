    "description": "The Murray building, situated on Cotton Tree Drive in Central, Hong Kong, was originally a government office block completed in 1969. Despite being only 27 storeys tall, when it was finally completed it was the tallest government office building at the time. \n\nIn 2018, after a period of renovation, the building was reopened to the public as The Murray Hotel. Offering spectacular views of the city, the building has won numerous design awards and is renowned for several unique architectural elements, one of which is the windows, which have all been specifically oriented to avoid direct sunlight. \n\nWe also noticed these windows and thought they would make an appropriate canvas for an arcade game, so here you have it: The Murray Snake.\n\nThis artwork is one of five iconic arcade games shown on the Murray building, using aerial photography, compositing and python programming to bring the game to life. It's a piece of history with an entertaining spin.\n\nGame on.",
