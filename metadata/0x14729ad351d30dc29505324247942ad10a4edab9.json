    "name": "Notorious B.I.G. by Pat Johnson - Curated Collection – Notorious Edition",
    "description": "This action photograph of Notorious B.I.G. rapping is an Edition of /7 and was captured by Pat Johnson in 1995, a year that many say defined Hip Hop Culture. Johnson shot this image using a Nikon camera with 35mm film in San Francisco, CA. at KMEL Summer Jam. During the set, the DJ’s records kept skipping which enraged Biggie who wound up throwing a bottle at the booth and chose not to finish the entire set due to “technical issues.” The Phto. Curated Collection showcases Limited Edition Collections and Auctions of iconic images and prominent catalogs, by legendary photographers. Learn more at www.Phto.io.",
