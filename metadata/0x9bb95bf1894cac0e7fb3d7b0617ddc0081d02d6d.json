    "name": "Kony's Brutal Reign",
    "description": "Joseph Kony is a notorious warlord who rose to infamy in the late 1980s & was born in 1961 in Uganda. In the late 1980s, he formed the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and started a brutal campaign against the Ugandan government. He kidnapped children, forced them to become soldiers and sex slaves, and committed atrocities against civilians. The conflict resulted in the displacement of millions and the deaths of thousands. \n\nKony was aided by his top commanders, including Vincent Otti, who was later killed in 2007. In 2012, Kony became internationally infamous due to a viral social media campaign. The \"Kony 2012\" campaign aimed to raise awareness of his crimes and bring him to justice.\n\nDespite efforts by the Ugandan military and the international community, Kony remains at large. Reports suggest that he may have fled to the Central African Republic. As of now, Kony's whereabouts and status are unknown.",
