    "description": "She would sit on our sofa and sip her coffee while listening to Jim Morrison. I would often do my own work in the other corner of the room, to be honest I would hardly get any work done, my attention belonged to her and I would often get lost in her eyes, tumbling down in her soul, While The End by Jim Morrison played in the background.",
