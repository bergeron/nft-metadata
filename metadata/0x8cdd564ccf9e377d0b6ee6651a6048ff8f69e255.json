    "description": "Circles symbolize continuity, the cyclical nature of life, and the eternal motion of the universe. In the human condition, they remind us that life is not linear, but rather a series of cycles. Continuity is the thread that weaves our experiences into a cohesive narrative, recognizing that everything is connected. Circles and continuity are a reminder of our mortality, but also a symbol of hope that our lives are part of something eternal and greater."
