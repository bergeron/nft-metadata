    "description": "Medea, the story of whom is based on her anger, is fascinating us with her bright-coloured eyes. Medea stands for the solid appearance of matriarchy. Properly speaking, she represents a substantial figure of a women who could endure plenty of hardships for her loved ones. Indeed, she is a sheer example of a person who can risk anything for them.
