    "description": "A performer skillfully manipulates bubbles.\nThe sight was reminiscent of a Wizard.\n\nPhoto Taken: 2020/11/18\nSize: 4892x3261\n\nShowa no Mori Park in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. My family and I often go to the park on holidays. Every Sunday, a performer comes to the park to give a bubble performance. He has so skillful technique, and it's an amazing bubble performance. However, he isn't paid for his work. He gives the children a chance to play with bubbles for free. They admire, laugh, and run around. It's a peaceful time that brings adults and children alike back to their childhood. I respected his thought and performance.",
