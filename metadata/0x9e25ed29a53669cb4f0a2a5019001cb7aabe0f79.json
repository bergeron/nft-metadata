    "description": "In \"Panopticon,\" the collision of opulence and distortion becomes a powerful metaphor for the dangers of immersion in the metaverse. The interplay of screens presents glimpses into a surreal tapestry of visions, capturing the essence of transformation, duality, and the fragility of identity. Through glitched transitions, the imagery transcends the boundaries of reality.\n\n\"Panopticon\" hints at the dissolution of self and the performative nature of society. It challenges our perception of power, inviting us to question the masks we wear and the consequences of losing ourselves in a digital world. \n\nThe allure of grandeur is juxtaposed with the unsettling presence of clown-like figures, reminding us of the fragile balance between aspirations and facade.\n\nPanopticon is created with the assistance of AI as part of it's process, all images are generated in AI and then further edited and animated in a combination of AI and a suite of glitch producing software.
