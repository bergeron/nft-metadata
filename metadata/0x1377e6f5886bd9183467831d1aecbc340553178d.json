    "description": "This part of a unique collection of 17 fae machine elves, each of which has a vampiric aspect. Each fae has its own unique name and universal function within the cosmos. A lot of my art is based on the various spiritual entities present in the multiverse, that exist on different frequencies. I base my art around my own interpretation of these beings, and draw inspiration based on what i've seen and experienced during my spiritual journey. This entity is nicknamed the left hand of the pale horse, and also has a twin aspect.",
