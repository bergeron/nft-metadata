    "description": "During my genealogy trip from April 18-22, 2023 with my brother Dominik, a daily Open Edition photo was published, which held a special value to me on that particular day. The photo is part of the collection \"Finding Tschitsch\" consisting of 1/1s and these 4 Open Editions. Holders of all 4 photos will receive a 5th photo for free, which is the result of a photo challenge presented to me by the All In NFT community. The collection is a mix of documentary and street photos taken during the trip.",
