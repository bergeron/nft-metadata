    "description": "A year ago, my Mum lost her battle to cancer.  \nI made this piece during the anniversary of her passing and found great comfort in the creative process.  \nWhile drawing, I was thinking about life, death and the cyclic nature of all things.  \nDespite being created during a time of sad memories, it's my intention that this piece radiates warmth and positivity. Ultimately, the artwork is about change. It's a celebration of the immense beauty of this magical little adventure we call life.\n\n3500 X 4590 px  \n1/1 hand drawn, mixed media illustration  \nThe genesis piece of this collection  \nRik Lee 2023",
