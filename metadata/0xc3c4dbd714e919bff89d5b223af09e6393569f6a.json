    "name": "Blooming cadenza",
    "description": "A cadenza is a typical harmonic turn that completes any level of musical construction.\n\nA tangle of odors diverts your attention from the flight. It clearly has something familiar that is still hidden from sight. Among these countless aromas, there is always that special one which is able to wake up all the sleeping instincts. It follows you like a subtle trail your whole life but only few can feel it. It relieves fatigue and promises a more interesting day tomorrow.\nIt is a dream you want to watch with great attention. \n\nArtwork by Anton Tantsev.\ninstagram.com/tonytantsev ",
