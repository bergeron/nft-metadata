    "description": "Human Pond is a photo manipulation I created in 2020 in a very intuitive way. In a moment of my life I was struggling with anxiety and while I was playing in Photoshop with different photographs this concept started to show up as the result of mixing a self-portrait with a foggy landscape photograph. I didn't know what I was creating but I liked it visually, only at the end, as it happen to me often, is when I found out its meaning was directly related to my emotional state in that moment. As I have told sometime, my creative process, especially photo manipulation part, allows me to make conscious many emotions and reveal me things, in a philosophical context that I wasn't even aware.\n\nThis piece end up being one of the most liked of mine among people and on of the most genuine for me.",
