    "description": "\"[The] photos each contain their own stories, which were unfolded, and through being photographed, are therefore no longer unfoldable per se.\" \n\nUnfolded features 36 images from Arron Teo’s street photography, split into 4 sets of 9 images loosely tied to one another to present a comparatively fixed narrative that has \"unfolded\". By rejecting a fixed order of presentation, Teo reproduces the serendipitous encounters that form the basis of street photography.\n\nHis works value the anonymity of his human subjects by capturing them with their backs turned to the camera, or digitally manipulating them to replace their real faces with imaginary ones. This anonymity draws attention not to personalities or elaborate stories, but small and fleeting social scenarios. Though the photographs seem mundane, it is exactly the intimacy of mundane scenes that has the power to contradict popular perceptions of social norms within the community – what should be or should not be, what is or what is not.",
