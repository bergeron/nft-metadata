    "description": "LGBTQIA+ life can be seen as a love in battle, which requires small gestures and great efforts from bodies and minds to cultivate it and keep it alive in society.\n\nJUST AS LIFE is a 3D dance piece created by mixing the language of dance with animation techniques and 3D simulation for the LOVE IS LOUDER project, curated by OdysseyOfTheHeart.\n\nWith JUST AS LIFE I keep asking: how to dance in Web 3.0? How to choreograph in the metaverse? How to reprocess the revolution brought about by the relationship between dance and 3D simulation? As a dance artist, I seek creative answers to these questions by articulating dance and 3D, NFTs, web3 and metaverses, provoking a dialogue between the classic and the contemporary and reflecting on the future of Art and Dance. Other bodies, other movements, other dances.\n\nArtist: Diego Mac\nDuration: 3'34\nMusic: Salut d'amour, Op. 12 (Edward Elgar / public domain)\nMP4 | 1920x1080\nCollector receives high quality version.",
