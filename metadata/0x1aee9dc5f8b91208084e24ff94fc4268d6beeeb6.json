    "description": "UNITY is a 1/1 image created by Jacob Riglin and Aggie Lal which has been fractionalised to support those affected by the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. 100% of the primary and secondary sales will go toward key initiatives and charities, which have been vetted by RELI3F (a web3 initiative to provide global humanitarian aid), to guarantee support for those in Ukraine that need it the most. \n\nWe believe, thanks to the deep community roots of web3, that we can make a huge difference by coming together in these challenging times. One of the 4 images that makes up this composite is from Ukrainian photographer Anton Jankovoy. \n\nThis piece is being fractionalised through fractional.art and secured on a Dream Lab / Manifold smart contract.
