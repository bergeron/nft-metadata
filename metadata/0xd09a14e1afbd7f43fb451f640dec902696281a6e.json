    "description": "I do believe that art must be understandable for everyone as much as possible. No matter how much time, energy, and skill you spend on creating artwork, if your work didn't make people think more, it means you couldn't reach the point of art.\n Taking this photo took me days and days to find the right angle and the right position of these two creatures (I feed birds at the edge of the window every evening and my cat used to watch them). After lots of effort, in the end, I had a beautiful photo that has something to say, but the both title and edit idea, and editing took only an hour and KABOOM!\nCreation occurred, art has been reborn and I imbued my artwork with eternal meaning.\nThe meaning that says peace always owns the victory, even if the predator was as close as a shadow.\nP.S: 25% of my NFT price will donate to the people of Ukraine.",
