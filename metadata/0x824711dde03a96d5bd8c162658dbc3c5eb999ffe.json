    "description": "I did a \"NEW DROP\" after a long time\nThe puppy I had been with for 13 years crossed the rainbow and went on a picnic.\nIt was difficult, but I think I was comforted by the illustration.\n\nThis time, I caught a student attending a magic school as a concept.\nAs a  naughty girl character, I mixed a clown image and a witch image.\n\nStory >\nWith a mischievous personality like a Small devil, she is at the center of various incidents, but the Magic School evaluates and monitors her abilities.\nThis evening, I set off firecrackers during an outdoor class and created a festive atmosphere saying that this is not the atmosphere I wanted.\nHowever, the reason he cannot catch her is that she runs away with her magical and scientific flying abilities.\nWill her mischief ever stop before graduation?\n\n\nI hope you look pretty\n\n",
