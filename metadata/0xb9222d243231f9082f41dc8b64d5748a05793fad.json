    "description": "IBM's supercomputer, Deep Blue, became the first computer to defeat a reigning world chess\nchampion under classical tournament conditions. This six game match is of great significance in chess and computing history, demonstrating the vast improvement of chess computing and as application of artificial intelligence, as it was a relatively new field of study in 1996. Now, through machine learning and neural networks, chess programs on your phone could defeat Deep Blue and its successors. At the time, however, Game 1 of this historic match pushed the limits of what computers were capable of."
