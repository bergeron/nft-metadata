    "name": "Autumn Faerie Forest Reflections",
    "description": "Autumn colours reflect in the gently flowing waters of Ireland's Streamstown River as it runs through the enchanted \"Faerie Forest\" near Thoor Ballylee in County Galway.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the famed Irish Poet and Nobel Laureate, W. B. Yeats, spent his summers here at his restored castle where he penned some of his most famous works, inspired by the incredible natural beauty around him.\n\n“Everything is so beautiful that to go elsewhere is to leave beauty behind,” Yeats once wrote to a friend.\n\nThis truly is a magical place. I visit here often during different seasons, always finding new beauty and inspiration.\n\nDimensions: 7200 x 9000px (300 dpi)\nFile Size: 42 MB",
