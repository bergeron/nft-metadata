    "description": "Here, in the tiny country of Kyrgyzstan, life moves with the steady beat of hooves. The horses mark the seasons. Always leading the nomads to greener pastures, up to the jailoo (high pastures) in the summer and down to the kyshtoo (low pastures) in the winter. Nature guides their movements but the horses carry them over these shared and sacred lands. \n\nA visit to Son Kul Lake will transport you 2000 years in the past. Horses play. Herds of sheep graze, a shepherd boy hot on their heels. Snow still clings to the mountains but it’s warm in the alpine valley. There are only a few yurt camps, no stores, no gas stations, just wonderfully warm and welcoming nomads who will share with you their stories and a cup of fermented mare's milk.  The landscape is vast, the horses strong like the deep rooted culture of this breathtaking place. They roam free.\n\n6020 x 4013px | 300 dpi\n\nThe first collector will also receive a fine art print (30 x 24”) and I’d love to jump on a call and hear your story.\n",
