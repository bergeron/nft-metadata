    "description": "High above the clouds in the Himalayas of Nepal, three climbers walk towards the verge before dissapearing into the clouds on their journey into the valley below. \n\nThis was a magical moment, that simply cannot be repeated, with some truly mystical cloud conditions. The photo was take at an elevation of 6000m above sea-level in freezing conditions while climbing Mount Manaslu (8,163m) in the Himalayas of Nepal.\n\nThis is a 1/1 edition and a physical print will be offered upon request to the new owner of 'The Heavens'.",
