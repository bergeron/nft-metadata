    "description": "Open Headition is an infinite generative open edition by Taylor Might with the theme of connection. The inspiration of this illustration comes from mushrooms and how they form colonies that are connected similar to a human nervous system. This art was chosen to represent the Open Edition because NFTs connect people and communities. Each piece comes with a unique color scheme as well as color placement. Some color schemes are more rare than others. Which colors will you get?",
