    "description": "This project never really began. Instead, it became a record of my personal and emotional trajectory. It became my “wound”.\n\nThis project is a “Seasonal Journal”, because like the world around us, we grow and evolve with time. As humans, we’re always in a state of change, and this is a reflection of the many internal and external phases I have experienced over the past few seasons. I’ve always felt the most at peace with nature, and I believe my perception of self shifts according to the natural cycle.",
