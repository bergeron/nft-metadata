    "name": "Chaos and Satoshi Nakamoto.",
    "description": "Chaos was the very first of all, the origin of everything, the empty and unfathomable space at the beginning of time.\nIn the beginning, there was only eternal, boundless, dark Chaos.\n\nSimilar to Chaos, there are many alleged identities of Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Since it was created in 2009, bitcoin has become a top digital currency and there has been copious speculation on Nakamoto’s true identity. \n\nIsn’t it going to be chaos, if bitcoin or another peer-to-peer digital currency did achieve widespread acceptance as a means of payment? Commercial banks could be circumvented. Financial regulations could be evaded. Governments could lose control over monetary policy and the ability to track money transfers.\n\nIs it impending? - I can’t wait another day\nDo we believe it’s the future? - If you don't believe me - I'm sorry\n\n",
