    "description": "Pablito was done in charcoal pencil, India ink, and oil pastel. His background is a made through tinkering with the Kaleidoscope feature in Pixlr. \n\nAs my first mint, I invite you to look at Pablito and tell me who and what you see.\n\nWhen I look at him, I see you a young man full of potential not yet realized. The background blooms signifying growth and he is crowned marking him as special in some way.",
