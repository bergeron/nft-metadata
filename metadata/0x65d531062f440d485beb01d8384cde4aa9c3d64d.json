    "description": "Are you familiar with the impulse of your soul, the marvelous excitement of perfection, as if you, passing through the cold of mirages, are plunged into the cherished bliss?  \nSweet as a dream, humble, we have avoided it, I know for sure it's been given to us since birth, but we haven't noticed it. \nA long-awaited moment of warmth heals the soul from sorrow. I wish we could learn not to lose ourselves, that we may never lose our bliss!  \nPainting by Marina Troino  \nAnimated by Kate Amirova  \nMusic by Greencross\n\n2023  \n",
