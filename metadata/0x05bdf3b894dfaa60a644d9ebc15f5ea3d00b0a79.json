    "description": "This balloon ðŸŽˆrepresents the child in you, but it has been kidnapped!\n\nThe idea of making this work of art arose when the artist asked himself a simple question,\n\nWhat if you gave control of your life to the child in you? \nAnd at that moment he realized that this child would act differently and take him down a different path, that in a way his adult-self had him kidnappedâ€¦ and it had been like that for a long time.\n\nThe inner child concept: \nBorn of Gestalt therapy, which aims to enable the patient to become more complete and creatively alive to free themselves from blockages and unfinished business \n\nWith the passage of time, this child hides in the depths of our being but comes to light in certain circumstances, such as, for example, when we need to face a project that demands a lot of imagination.\n\nMost people don't realize the existence of this inner child, but the truth is that sometimes it is who determines how we respond to certain circumstances.\n\n*Icon ðŸŽˆ\\ [ T.T ] ",
