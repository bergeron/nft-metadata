    "description": "When shooting a cluster of Aspergillus which I found on a decomposing pumpkin, not long after Halloween, I thought, hold up...I've seen that (now infamous) haircut before and there he was, just lying there (lying being the operative word). #SBF\n\nThis image was shot with the Canon MP-E 65mm 1 -5x Macro lens (at approximately 3x) with a Canon 5d MKiii and Yongnuo YN24-EX flash (1/250 sec, F8.0, ISO 200). It is the initial piece from my TWIR (The world is round) series (controversial...I know) exploring spherical objects in nature.\n\nAs my 1st attempt to deploy a smart contract on Manifold (or in general). I have decided to make this a free to mint, open edition as my contribution to the many excellent pieces of art that have been made to provide commentary around one of the largest (and craziest) crypto stories of this year so far and also to draw attention to what I do...shoot macro.",
