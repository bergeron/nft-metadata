    "description": "On a warm summer evening I decided to visit the Teddycows again. It had been a while since I was working on a Batcher project at that time. But in-between different projects I always love to visit the Teddycows. After a little walk I spotted a group of them and I started looking for the smaller ones, they are my favourite because the curiosity, the cuteness and the special interaction you can have with them. In the corner of my eye I saw this little Teddy stunner grazing between the trees. When I approached him he immediately looked up and started staring at me for seconds, this gave me the perfect opportunity to compose my shot with the lush summer greens in the background. Definitely one of the cutest things on the Blockchain, Cuteness Overload!\n\nSigned physical print included.\n\n1/1 NFT.",
