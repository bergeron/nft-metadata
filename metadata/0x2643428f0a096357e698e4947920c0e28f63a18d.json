    "description": "MOMENT 01 - NYC Show Highlight Reel (1-7-23)\n\nIt's every artist's dream to have their name chanted after they sang their heart out on stage. Last month it became my reality. \n\nI headlined a Breaking Sound showcase at Pianos NYC in January. Energy was unreal. Support was unparalled. Incredible way to start the year.\n\nOne day, when we are performing nation-wide tours in stadiums, this will be classic footage from the archive to help us remember where we started. This is just the beginning.\n\n--\n\nMUSIC MOMENTS is a web3 journal of key moments in my journey as an independent artist. Every week I will add an entry to this journal in the form of an visual/audio NFT to document the journey forever on chain, and give you a peek behind the curtain. \nThanks for coming on the ride.\n\n--\n\nAbout me:\nRMS is a storyteller who merges conceptual lyricism, soulful soundscapes, and his experience as a child of Indian immigrants to bring a cinematic sound of his own to the hip hop scene.
