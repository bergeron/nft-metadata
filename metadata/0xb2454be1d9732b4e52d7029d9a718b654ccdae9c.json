The colours in this artwork has been inspired by the Cyberpunk theme to combine the power of the futuristic machine with the feel of the traditional mythological characters. The Cyberpunk theme also serves as a subtle depiction of the futuristic machinery that are produced by Royal Enfield, which are extremely powerful and unlike any other motorcycle. ",
