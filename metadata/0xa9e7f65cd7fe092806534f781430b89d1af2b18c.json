    "description": "The artwork you’re witnessing was created in January, 2021, when the pandemic was still in full swing. The bubble wrap comes from the online shopping I was doing during that time, of course (we’re all guilty). Imagine how lonely I was, taking into account I was new in town. Those were the times of skin hunger, but also those of self love and exploration, so “Bubble butt” is a metaphor of enjoying my body to me. And who wouldn’t enjoy popping some bubbles at the same time? An all-inclusive-asmr experience, isn’t it? The video had an absolute success all over the internet: it was reposted by celebrities, got viral a hundred times on Twitter and Instagram, and was even published by the awesomest @love.watts and the notorious @godzdntdie. You may even have seen it yourself somewhere!\nGlobal warming, pandemic, WW3? Anti-stress kit \"Bubble Butt\" will always be there for you:)",
