    "description": "The lyrics for this song flowed from me in February 2020, just before the world went into lockdown. I was reflecting on my life's journey and how I would describe it to someone else. \n\nI've immersed myself in visualization as long as I can remember. On road trips as a kid, I would gaze out the window and let my imagination run wild. \n\nAs a grown up, I noticed that my visualizations were my reality, so I became very intentional with how I used this skill to harness my power from within.\n\nThis is my Genesis NFT and it represents a reflection of my manifestation process. I'm sharing it with hope to inspire the one who receives it, to believe that they can use their vision as a source of power.\n\nWe are what we see.",
