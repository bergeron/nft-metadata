    "description": "The story of Little Red Riding Hood has survived thanks to oral tradition, and later, by the different literary versions. Although the story has changed over the centuries and its origin is unknown, it could be said that she is one of the most famous girls in the world. \n\nMost people remember her as a charming and innocent girl devoured by the evil wolf, but I prefer to remember her as in the anonymous versions told in the taverns: a cunning heroine who doesn't need the help of a hunter to escape from the wolf and return home.\n\n\nDigital painting\n3992 x 4160 px\n300 dpi\n",
