    "description": "29 Moons is a series of works by artist and photographer Assaf Hinden. The series consists of 29 variations of the moon. Each variation is digitally collaged out of numerous images of the moon: from the 1920’s to this day (2020’s). All together, the 29 works produce a complete circle: a full moon.",
