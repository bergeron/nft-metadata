    "name": "The Enlightened One",
    "description": "In this troubled times in which we live, where conflicting emotions and diseases of the soul spread like an overwhelming virus, nothing better than learning from the history of those who transcended matter, aiming at the image of free love regardless of conditions and interests. A real love, connected to the supreme source that supplies us radiating light to all our cells, making our lives more complete and happy.\n\n\nBuddha means \"Awakened, Enlightened\" and it is not just a person, but a title given in Buddhist philosophy to those who have attained the enlightenment of all divine knowledge and set about spreading them, bringing spiritual awakening to other beings.\n\nThe search for the truth is something natural to all human beings. It is there, in the sacred centre of our heart, that the truth dwells, which is unique to each one. Personal and non-transferable, varying from person to person, depending on the interpretation and depth of each soul.",
