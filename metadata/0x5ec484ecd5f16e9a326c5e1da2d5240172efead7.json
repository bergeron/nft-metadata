    "name": "Dalyan",
    "description": "Dalyan means \"fishing weir\" in Turkish. Bass, Mullet and Sea Bream swim upstream from the sea to Köyceğiz Lake where another large town of the region, Köyceğiz, is located. The fish spawn there, and when returning to the sea they are caught in the \"dalyans\". According to the turkish etymological dictionary Nisanyan Sözlük, dalyan (ta aliana) derives from the greek word aliia (αλιεία) which means fishing.\n\nDalyan canal, (Dalyan Strait), is a stream in Muğla province, which carries the waters of Köyceğiz Lake to the sea, and is the lake's drain. Its length is 10 km. The waters coming out of the lake reach the sea by drawing meanders.",
