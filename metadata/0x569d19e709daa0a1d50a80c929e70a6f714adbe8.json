    "description": "Welcome to my INEFABLES Series\n\n\"... There are spaces in us where enigmas occur, that's why I look for an understanding, a connection and an order in the creative process at all levels, but above all at an emotional level\" \nMany of these feelings, and enigmatic perceptions, are sometimes indescribable or inexplicable, this leads me to think of another type of intelligence related to intuition, which is a subject that is often dismissed for lacking scientific verification, however, we do not stop experiencing it in different ways.\n\nThis series is an offering to my creative process, to my recent reflections and findings on my work.",
