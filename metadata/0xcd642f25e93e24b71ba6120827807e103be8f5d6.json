Collect the hearts if you're worthy, and carry them through, or burn them on the way for something new. \nIt's your heart, your call. \nCan you close the gap? Is it enough? Can you turn this into a Heart of Gold?  \nWe'll see. \n\n\n[This NFT is part of a special series that will allow you to be eligible for future drops and burns, treat it carefully]  \n\n\n.  \nThe night is young,  \nthe words won't come,  \nthe day is old,  \nthe words won't come\n\nI've lost my soul,  \nthe words won't come,  \nI've lost my heart,  \nthe words won't come.\n\nPlease, I'm begging,  \nteach me how  \nto love again",
