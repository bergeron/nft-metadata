    "description": "Each of us has a river of passion inside. This river produces a flow where we find our sense of purpose and the drive that empowers our motivation. The root word for motivation is motive and today the word motive generally has a negative connotation, but we all have motives. Motive is the strength behind motivation, and without a motive there is no passion. \nYou will never discover your purpose without defining your passion. Successful people are driven by something. How do you discern your God given passion? How do you develop your purpose and release the power these create to energize a life of significance?\n Knowing and understanding your passion is critical to understanding your purpose in life and in producing the motivation that drives your life. Your passion is a key to joy!\n\n Define your Passion! Passion excites, and it will produce Joy.\n Discover and develop your Purpose! Purpose satisfies, and it will produce a sense of Satisfaction.\n\n\n",
