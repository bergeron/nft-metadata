The metal cans produced in Palestine cannot\ncount with the “one shekel” stamp, and thus they cannot be recycled. They only become wandering garbage. Flattened by car wheels, stomped by a foot, kicked by pedestrians.\n\nWhen Rodrigo Imaz stumbled upon this powerful phenomenon in the city’s streets, he decided to re-present what the cans could say. In a gesture of disruptive pop transfiguration, these images became the reflection of the issue.",
