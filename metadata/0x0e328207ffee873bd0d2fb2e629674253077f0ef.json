It took learning more than everyone else wanted to. Being more prepared and present than everyone else wanted to. Loved, revered, feared and hated a little bit. The persistent, repetitive and patient nature of the degen who showed up every day to learn the future is now contributing to it and participating in it. They know what they want. Thats why they gotta have it. They make it happen.",
