    "name": "0/XXII The Fool",
    "description": "This card takes 0 or 22th place in the line of Major Arcanas.\n\nThe Fool symbolizes the baby that lives in the soul of each of us. No plan, no preparation. Children do the same: they just play, enjoying it and not thinking about the consequences. Also, the card can signal infantilism, which is fraught with stupid actions and a complete lack of control over the situation.\n\nA fool can be different: cheerful, funny, angry and sad. But his main credo is to live for today. \n\nIt is as open as possible, but just as unreliable. Its appearance can be interpreted in two ways: as a symbol of the fact that you need to grow up and gain experience, or vice versa - get rid of seriousness and remember childhood. \n\nThe jester will burst into life, regardless of your desire. Therefore, it is better to prepare, remove all valuables and have fun.",
