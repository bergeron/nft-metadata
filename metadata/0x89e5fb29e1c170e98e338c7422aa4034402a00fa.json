It's the beginning of something amazing!\n\nIt's inspired by my life long pursuit of spiritual connection. I've always had a fascination with the ways in which humanity connects with it's spiritual side. This collection and piece touch on that focus.\n\nDimensions: 4K: 3584 Ã— 2016 \nType: Quicktime, H.264, MP4\nAudio Type: No Audio\n",
