    "description": "The second piece belonging to my genesis collection #theworldbelow, arguably my most precious series, portraing the mausoleum of Taj Mahal over a sea of clouds formations on river Yamuna.\n\nThe eternal monument to love was built in 1632 to homage Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of moghul Shāh Jahān who died while giving birth to their 14th child (!).\n\nSince my first visit to India in 2001 I have been obsessed with the marble monument, because of its unique moghul architecture and because of the story behind it. \n\nBeing able to photograph and witness such splendour from he air was one of the greatest achievment of my photography career, and the vision on that very morning exceeded my wildest expectations, with the Taj floating over a sea of clouds formed over Yamuna river.\n\nThe people walking early in the morning at the base of the monument help to give the idea of the sheer size of this incredible Moghul masterpiece and a UNESCO Site.\n",
