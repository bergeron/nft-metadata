    "description": "Emily Lazar is a multi-disciplinary artist fronting the rock/metal transmedia project, September Mourning. She made history as the first female metal/ hard rock musician to mint and sell an NFT on the blockchain. She has spoken about her accomplishments in Web 3/ NFT's at Harvard (2x), NFT.NYC and ETH Denver Conferences.\n\nSeptember Mourning is a transmedia project based on a comic book series she wrote and published through Image/Top Cow Comics with her business partner Marc Silvestri (Batman/Witchblade/Darkness). September Mourning is the title character. As a human reaper hybrid, she  gives expired souls a second chance at life in another body. In doing so, she messes with  the plans of the antagonist, Fate, who is trying to rid  earth of all the good souls and leave the bad so the world will self-destruct and It can start anew. An epic war between the living and the dead ensues. Emily plays the title character on stage.\n\nEmily designed the world she and her band (Rich Juzwick, Kyle Mayer and Aaron Hoover) bring to life on stage, including costumes, choreography, sets, etc. The band has toured with & opened festivals for Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Mudvayne and others across Europe and the United States.\n\nBlack Dave is an artist creating at the intersection of anime, streetwear, rap music and sneaker culture. Entering web3 in late 2020, he’s established himself as a thought leader and innovator within it. Having a background in punk and hardcore, as well as rap and production, collaborating with a metal band only made sense.\n\n\"Wake The Dead Featuring Black Dave\" takes the September Mourning sound to a whole new level by infusing heavy metal with hip hop and trap music. The anthemic song lyrics by Emily reinforce the theme of the September Mourning storyline which is to own one's own voice and make one's own decisions with purpose and intent in order to squeeze every last incredible drop of life from one's soul while on this planet. Black Dave's lyrics reinforce that as well with a call to arms and intense fighting spirit. \n\nThe artwork features Fate, the antagonist from the books and the subject that the song is rallying against.\n",
