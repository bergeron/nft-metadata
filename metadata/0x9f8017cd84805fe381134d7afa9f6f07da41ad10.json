    "description": "In this extraordinary painting, a young girl with long and beautiful hair is depicted. She has a cage at the bottom of her torso, inside of which are beautiful and shiny canary birds. However, the girl with the red thread in her hand is looking for a way to free these birds.\nBehind the girl, there is a tall and strong tree whose branches extend from her shoulders. This tree is a symbol of life that gives the girl hope and power to use her red thread to free the birds from the cage.\nA crow has emerged from the girl's hair, which appears to be a symbol of freedom and happiness, while her hair is burning in the fire. This image represents death and rebirth, an explosion of life and freedom.\nOverall, this painting is a symbol of human desires for freedom, happiness, and liberation from the limitations that life can create for us.",
