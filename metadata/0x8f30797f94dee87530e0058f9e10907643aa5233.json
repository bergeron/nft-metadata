    "description": "Video-performance\nLoop 31''\n2022\n\n\nAs a light and ephemeral life form, Skin can “be immortal and then die” (Jean-Luc Godard). However, to perform in the metaverse, Skin must kill its unambiguous personality and continue through its potential multiplicity. \n\nHow can you kill what doesn’t exist? Like the Neuromancer, Skin “doesn’t know it doesn’t exist, but it works all the time”, executing an unconscious script to perfection, playing its own loop in a place from which it won't return. At the same time, it reproduces romantic tragedy from ​​the Argentine poet Alfonsina Storni (which has installed her as a symbol) and it accesses a network to expand itself, to acquire a cryptographic dimension and install itself as an object.",
