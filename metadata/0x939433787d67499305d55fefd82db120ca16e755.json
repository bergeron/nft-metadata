    "description": "On the tongue of these Dank Sneeks, you’ll find a shout out to the homie Erick Calderon (Snowfro) and his Chromie Squiggles.\n\nSquiggles are a project that almost single handedly lit the candle for generative art, teaching us all how incredibly well traits and iterations within a generative art collection could present themselves, and even sport, as they’re even featured IRL, on the shirts of Crawley Town FC.\n\nShout out Squiggles & Snowfro.\n\nSecond up, as we make our way down the kick, you’ll see an easily recognisable pair of shades… to those who know. These belong to one XCOPY, a meme lord amongst meme plebs, having been created for the memes.\n\nShout out XCOPY.\n\nNext you’ve got a classic “GM”, you know we love one or two of those with our cobbee’s…\n\nThen the face of pepe, our resilient frog.",
