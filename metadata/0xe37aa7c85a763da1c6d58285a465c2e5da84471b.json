    "description": "With 4C 4F 56 45 ( LOVE in hexadecimal code ), conceptual artist and CryptoArt pioneer Kevin Abosch presents 14 animated digital works, individually and collectively forming a treatise on the attenuation of fear through love.  \n\nWorking ritualistically with deep-learning algorithms, Abosch has distilled emotional value from more than 100,000 public social media posts that include the word “love.” The resultant “truths” are subsequently encrypted into three layers of hexadecimal alphanumerics superimposed upon each other. \nThrough the reliability of an unwavering red field, the artist conveys the absolutism of love, while three distinct compositions of faint alphanumerics perform a triangulated loop, undermining any suggestion that love can be fully understood.\n\nThe viewer is encouraged to synchronise their mind with the morphological determination of the work and submit to love itself.\n\nAbosch says, “If we tend towards fearing things we are not able to fully understand, we must submit to not understanding them in order to to allow love to supersede fear.”",
