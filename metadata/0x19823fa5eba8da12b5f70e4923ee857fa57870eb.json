    "description": "IN YOUR HANDS\nPt. 3/5 (Answers EP)\n\nFeeling the unspoken energy of someone through their body beyond their words; I was continually trapping myself inside a web governed by Neptune and the refusal to face reality. ‘In Your Hands’ was the exact point of surrender. I had spent my life forcing situations, exhausting my heart hoping for love where it was not available. For the first time, I was able to let go and trust in something greater.\n\nWritten & produced by ALYSS\n\n\n♅\n\nYou got my body in your hands\nBut you won't take it\nYou think that I won't understand\nBut I swear I'm braver\nFrom before, when I was\nWhen I would live in fear\nBut times change, it's too late\nThat's when you disappeared\n\nInto the air, I left it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nI know you care, I felt it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nBut the gods took you away\nTo a land, another land\nSo I won't fight our fate\nIt's in your hands, in your hands\n\nI know your barrier is cold\nWe're both the same\nThe depths we dive no parallel\nYou're the first i found\nWho is not afraid\nTo go where they won't go\nTo believe in something\nBut they're just seeds we throw\n\nInto the air, I left it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nAnd, oh, you care, I felt it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nBut the gods took you away\nTo a land, another land\nSo I won't fight our fate\nIt's in your hands, in your hands\n\nOur hearts beat out of time\nBut I keep thinkin' 'bout, keep on thinkin' bout\nThere must be somethin' that\nAin't quite finished yet\nI know there is a higher power\nI'll hold it\n\nInto the air, I left it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nAnd, oh, you care, I felt it\nIn your hands, in your hands\nBut the gods took you away\nTo a land, another land\nSo I won't fight our fate\nIt's in your hands, in your hands",
