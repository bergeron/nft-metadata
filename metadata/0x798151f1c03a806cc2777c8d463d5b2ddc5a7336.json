    "name": "Trips of the three eyed angel 1",
    "description": "The three eyed angel roams the sky. She goes anywhere freely. lands on distant planets and walks on them, flies in their atmosphere and transmits images of the farthest parts of the universe to us. She doesn't need oxygen or hydrogen or any other element to survive. Changes in temperature, pressure and gravity also have no effect on her. She knows the shortcuts of the space and moves quickly in the universe.\n\nAn artist's imagination can be very powerful. The third eye of this angel observes images of the most unknown parts of the universe, where the most powerful telescopes will never be able to discover them.\nI have made this 3D character in Zbrush Then I imported it to the Cinema 4D and did the character movements, lighting, space creation, rendering and all the necessary works in the Cinema 4D. Also i made music in FLstudio.\n#3Dart",
