    "description": "The Eternal Flame is an archetype represented in countless ancient cultures and religions. It symbolizes the fire of the communal soul in a people or culture. Many countries place it in the center of war memorials to commemorate those that sacrificed their lives to keep the flame of their people alight. \n\nThis is EternalPepe's genesis piece and its FREE. The point is to light a flame, not make a bag. What's the utility? EternalPepe will never forget you were here for the first one. \n\nAI + AE + EP",
