    "description": "black lodge | white lodge\nwas created as a vr experience for burningman 2021.\nthe concept of the black lodge and the white lodge stems from the tv series “twin peaks“, where the black lodge in essence depicts the abyss of the soul through which one has to wander to get to the white lodge, which stands for salvation of the soul.\nin the project, the two lodges are colliding and captured within a zeppelin-like structure, which is represented by the fusion of two geometric spheres.\na portal linking the spheres allows the passing between the lodges, but each lodge can also be entered separately from the outside.\nwhereas the black lodge is themed after the sun, the white lodge is themed after the moon, which is a reversal of light and shadow in itself and hints to a yin and yang like \ninternal structure of the lodges.",
