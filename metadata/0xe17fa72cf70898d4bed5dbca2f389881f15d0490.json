    "description": "After a hiatus from my personal music, I found myself falling into the same old patterns of production. I had a standard process - writing chords, into drums, into an ABC arrangement that was all too safe after months of needing to start ideas quickly in my sessions.\n\nOver my career, a few tracks and experiences have marked breakthroughs in my creative process. Wavelength is one of those tracks.\n\nThis track started with a few demo guitar riffs and chords by my good friend, glass tux. After hearing it and polishing up the chords, I knew I had to turn this into something outside of my comfort zone. \n\nHere is a track, with my humble take, on textures, ear candy, swing, and all of the finer details of production that I usually omit in favor staying in my melodic comfort zone. I've learned so much more from this track, and I hope you enjoy Wavelength as much as I did working on it.\n\nArt credits: https://www.instagram.com/lilo__bee/\nGuitar work: https://www.instagram.com/glass_tux/",
