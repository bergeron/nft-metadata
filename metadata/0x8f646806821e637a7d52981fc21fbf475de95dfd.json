    "description": "In the realm of broken dreams traveling around Universe absorbing all the chaos around me, I have been chosen by the individuals of this Planet. I am hollow when I am alone, I am inevitable when I am with the mass, Mayhem is the result of this world that we have been shown from the past decades, we have been told to be a part of this or to die in vain. We are like seeds we grow silently but a treefall makes sound, Destruction has noise but creation is silent. Be a Creation not a destruction.",
