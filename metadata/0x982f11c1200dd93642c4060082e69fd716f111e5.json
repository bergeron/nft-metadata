    "description": "I was sitting in a rented Tesla waiting for it to charge when the young homie, CUBE random sent me this instrumental with these crazy chords. I played it on repeat until the car was charged. For some reason, the track reminded me of girls from philly. The title \"Pretty Brown Jawn\" with its respective chorus came to me as natural as breath. \n\n\tIn my mind I imagined a brown-skinned woman minding her business in a cafe, sipping her coffee & me working up the confidence to talk to her. In real life, Iâ€™m not that smooth but i can make you laugh if I'm nervous enough. I decided to display some of my sense of humor in the 2nd verse. \n\n\tThis track features production from a 17-year prodigy who goes by the name of \"CUBE\", a Dreamsoulja turned friend and collaborator. Jermaine Paul deserves flowers and chocolate for his outstanding work on bass. The vibe of this sound definitely calls back to the Soulquarians and the Electric Lady Studios sound. ",
