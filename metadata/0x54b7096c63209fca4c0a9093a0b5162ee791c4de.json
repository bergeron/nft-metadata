    "description": "The pain in my brain is too much. I see pain every day through every nerve, every orifice and every single atomic inch of my spirit, soul and mind, my existence is pain, but I must absolutely push on.\n\nBrain Pain Stats: The background is a piece created by JakeTheDegen which is now fully CC0. I incorporated it into my work because I love JakeTheDegen, and his work. Plus, it's a CC0 imprint of his work in one of my glitch art & pieces forever engrained permanently into the Ethereum blockchain. Then, I created my own glitch art incorporating his beautiful CC0 work as a wonderful and such a fitting, lovely background for this piece called \"Brain Pain\" - thank you all for reading this and have a very lovely day today.\n\nÂ© 2022 Apex Shift.
