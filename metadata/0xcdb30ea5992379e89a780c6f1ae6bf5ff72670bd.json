    "description": "Taken in Central Park, New York. Was feeling still cold and crisp. But I could feel spring was quickly approaching. Everything seems to be frozen and dead during winter, but look! Spring shows that the nature is a constant and continuous cycle of life and death. You must endure the harsh winter to spring and to enjoy the beauties of life and spring. \n\nThis photo represents Spring out of 4 seasons in WMFG 4 Seasons Edition.",
