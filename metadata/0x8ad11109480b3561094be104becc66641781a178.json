    "description": "But in mid-September the weather suddenly and unexpectedly changed dramatically. There came calm, cloudless days that were sunnier and mellower than they had been in August. On dried compressed fields, on their prickly yellow bristles, the autumn web shone with mica shine.\n\nShe was very happy with the lovely days, silence, solitude, clean air, chirping on the telegraph wires of swallows preparing for migration, and the gentle salty breeze, which was pulling weakly from the sea.\n\nShe had always loved those beautiful autumn days, associating them with distant, cherished memories of her childhood, always expecting them to bring something wonderfully happy.\n\nLikewise, she always felt that splendor, the breath of autumn.",
