    "description": "This animated (AUDIO-VISUAL) 3D artwork describes the many obstacles, crisis, and ugly incidence that we face as living beings, which most often, people around us do not actually know how we feel or experience such and judge us from a different perspective.\n\nIrrespective of how people try to see us from their own perspectives, we alone truly knows how we feel, and where it hurts us the most.\n\nWe are the truest observers of what we pass through (pains, tribulations and more) and each time we feel such, there's always an inward inspiration that triggers us to push ahead once more.\n\nCreation Media: Modelled with Sculpt tool and Animated using Animator.\n\nUTILITY: Collector will freely receive the still image in addition to this animated artwork.",
