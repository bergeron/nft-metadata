    "description": "White Butterfly Boy lured Rain Boy’s wife and daughter out of their home by changing himself into a butterfly when Rain Boy was away. White Butterfly Boy held them captive in his own home far away in Chaco Canyon. Discovering his family was missing, Rain Boy sent out a streak of lightning to point the direction of his wife and daughter. When White Butterfly Boy came flying home at night he found Rain Boy waiting. Rain Boy said, \"I challenge you to a race. If you win, you may keep my wife and daughter. If you lose, you die.” The two raced to Mount Taylor and back. White Butterfly Boy returned home to find Rain Boy had easily won. White Butterfly Boy requested four times he be killed with his own axe. Rain Boy agreed, knowing the magic axe would kill whoever held it. White Butterfly Boy closed his eyes and did not see Rain Boy wielding his own weapon. The deadly blow cracked open White Butterfly Boy’s skull and out came the flutter of the colorful butterflies we know today.",
