    "description": "Leonard Knight created Salvation Mountain in the California desert with innumerable cans of paint. At this time of this picture, he estimated he had applied at least twenty layers of paint on the hill to resist weathering. After this portrait helped make him better-known, he went on to appear in the film Into the Wild. His creation of religious folk art appeared in Coldplay’s music video Birds, among other numerous media appearances, and was recognized in the US Congress by Senator Barbara Boxer. He has passed on, but if you are curious about him, his scenes in Into the Wild are, to me, clearly unscripted. They just let the camera roll, I’m sure of it. Shot on Velvia slide film and digitized with a high-quality Imacon film scanner.",
