    "description": "Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, is like an ocean, with its surface constantly rippling. One night, as I was walking along the shore of the lake, I noticed that I could not hear the sound of the waves that I usually hear. When I looked at the surface of the lake, it was still as if it were a mirror. Surprised, I hurriedly took my camera out of my house and filmed the reflection of the clouds on the surface of that lake for about three minutes. I was impressed by what my friend, who saw the result, said \"It's like an aurora of clouds!\"",
