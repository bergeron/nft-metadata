    "description": "As I got out of the car on the side of the freeway and started walking towards the beach, I was overwhelmed with a sense of familiarity; the cold fresh air, the sun in my eyes, and the sound of the waves. Memories of the time I spent in Los Angeles, California as a grad student and a few summers in Bay Area after graduation came rushing back, and I realized that a lot has changed since then. One thing that won't change, however, is me coming back to you.",
