    "description": "The Bored Ape Yacht Club became a global pop culture phenomenon in 2021 and remains one of the most sought after NFT collections ever created. This artwork pays homage to Gordon Goner's Tweet in March 2022 where he wrote \"Fuck doing expected things. Back to the lab.\". A bold statement that has become synonymous with the brands every move as they carve out their own path as true pioneers of the web3 space.\n\nThis artwork is infused with an NFC chip which when scanned using the LTD.INC app will reveal the edition number which is linked to the digital NFT counterpart, plus further product details and exclusive content only accessible to the NFT owner.\n\nLTD.INC aims to offer an elevated and interactive brand and product experience.\n\nHistory of the Bored Ape Yacht Club:\n\nThere are 10,000 original Bored Ape NFTs, each with a different combination of features like fur color, background color, outfits, and accessories that make each one unique. All share the same uninterested look. These features give each ape a certain value, depending on how many apes also share the same characteristics.",
