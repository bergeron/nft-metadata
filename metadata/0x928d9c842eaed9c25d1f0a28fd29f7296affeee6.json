Like they have once been, and I believe they were the reason.\n\nBut, do crows cause bad luck?\nAre good and evil certain?\nOr each defines another one and makes a loop.\n\nThe loop that turns into vertigo inside my head, comes to an end and it begins again for my better understanding of reasons.",
