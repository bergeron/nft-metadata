    "description": "superflirt here:) I wrote 'Sober' about college drinking culture and what it feels like to be the only one who doesnâ€™t care to get drunk. There was a long time that I felt isolated and judged for my lack of drinking and I wanted to write about that. The video was beautifully captured on 65mm film by No Storage Productions (Sonali Chugani, Meg Darbourne, Bridget Taylor), a female-led student filmmaker team. With only 14 minutes of film to shoot, each shot is a raw, one of one take.\n\nA little about me: I am a 21 year old songwriter/producer originally from Summit, New Jersey. Now based in San Diego, I am leaning into a nostalgic 80s pop sound, with elements of classic rock and modern indie.\n\nNFT holders will gain access to a private discord channel. You will be able to chat with me directly and be the first to hear demos and updates. Hope you enjoy the video!\n",
