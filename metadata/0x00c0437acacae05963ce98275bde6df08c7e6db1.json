Still \n(Digital Renaissance Era) \nArtists back on top, locked up on the block\n'Cause when I mint the drops I wanna rock\nBest believe the pic ain't stock when I hit the spot\nReal ones say good morning but paper hands keep scrollin'\nHow Brother? Generational wealth for all (Brother)\nSee a friend grinding? Go retweet it\nThe game done changed\nBags got fumbled but we gonna make it\n(If you ain't up on thangs) \nDeFi is the name\nAnd we're ahead of the game\nStill trading Eth, \nStill got NFTs, still not loving gas fees\nStill rockin' the same digital PFP\nStill have my community, reppin' invisibly (for life)\nStill the tech bangs for everyone on the main,\nNet won't ever again be the same, still\nI'm representin' for all the degens all across the world\n(Still) Ridin' out the bear like M Cozomo, girl\nStill building with the bulls despite the greed\nAnd I still got love for Web3, it's the D.R.E.\nhttps://twitter.com/aSeldomSeenKid/status/1612228771649839105\nWe don't read poetry because its cute JK",
