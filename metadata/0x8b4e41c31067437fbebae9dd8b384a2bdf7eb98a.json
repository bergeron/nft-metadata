    "description": "Photo was taken handheld without safety procedures capturing a local street market in Kowloon, Hong Kong, pre-covid. \n\nThe urban freneticism and hyperactivity that I like to represent are expressed by a condensation of shooting angles, which draw the spectator's eye. Once again I move away from the traditional representation that we have of the landscapes around us in order to present a highly poetic vision.\n\nBringing a new definition to urban landscape photography, and exploring unlimited possibilities in photography without a drone.\n\nâ€” I love how this photo shows and reminds me how tiny we are, in the universe.\n\n*This piece comes with an exclusive signed x-large physical art print*",
