    "description": "\"InOut\" is part of the PERCEPTION OF PLAY serie. The theme addressed is the analysis and interpretation of the child's perception of play, especially in the first phase of discovery of their surroundings, in which all the elements that are part of it and their representation are structured to define the child's conception of the surrounding space.\n\nThe perception of colours, shapes and how they interact with space, the surreal representation of reality filtered through the undefined senses; how, even in simplicity, a child's mind can often create a dreamlike dimension, almost detached from the object's function, from what it was designed for. A series of video and printed works in which the viewer is immersed in a surreal world, defined by animated 3D elements that interact with each other, artistically interpreting what a child might perceive and process.",
