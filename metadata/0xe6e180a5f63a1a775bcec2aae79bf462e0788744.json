    "description": "This work peels back the layers between worlds, exploring the concept of how we transition from this world to the next. In addition to painters like Caravaggio and Michelangelo, another influence was The Last Judgment from the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, which depicts the weighing of a heart against a feather to decide ones fate in the afterlife. The sum total of the good and bad of your life determines whether you are allowed into the afterlife or devoured by a monster.\n\nWayfinder | 2023"
