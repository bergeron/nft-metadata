    "description": "At dCommunity, we look at the magic of decentralization similar to how some believe there is a Christmas magic.  That is why every year, dSnowman makes his long journey to the North Pole to grab some of this magic.  Taking in a few shared moments with Santa, dSnowman turns his thoughts to the job at hand.  That is to gift as many as possible.  If you are lucky enough to be along his path, that decentralized magic will be closer than you think.",
