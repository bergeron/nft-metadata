    "description": "NFT Fashion Artist Talia Zoref aims to bring joy and positivity through her art using vibrant colors with passion, energy, life and character to her paintings. She created a fun but critical view of the fashion world, where creative, free and original characters coexist with judgmental and critical figures. She expressed her feelings through eyes-only dialogue characters, to which she added curly and long lashes that are hallmark of her illustrations . Talia loves exploring different types of techniques and media such as digital illustration, Watercolor, Acrylic on Canvas, Spray mixed media and Marker. She paints creates sketches with bold fast lines and strong colors.\n\nThis unique, colorful and vibrant NFT Art piece is inspired by the contrast between the colorful and fun fashion world and the judging eye in the industry. This painting of an Eye with a bathing suite and aims to show the joy of summer, swimming and freedom with bright colors and an essence of fun.\n",
