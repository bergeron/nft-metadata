    "description": "Street Photography, 2022 - Shinjuku, Tokyo\nPhotographed by Goro - *one loud image*\n\nThis is the first selected image of the DEFAULT TOKYO series that features in the NFT project.\n\nSome 3 million motor vehicles are registered in Tokyo, hence the remaining 11 million people are taking... that's right, the train.\nSometimes, however, people want to enjoy the comfortable ride in one of the many cabs. They are available, always clean and shiny, and the extra soft suspension conveys the impression of lying in an oversized tester bed. The driver behaves and looks butler-like, the amount of payment methods leaves nothing to be desired, and the doors open and close automatically as if by an invisible hand.\n\nThe photo was taken at the \"Ichiban-Gai Gate\", the iconic entrance to the entertainment and red-light district Kabukicho, known as \"Sleepless Town\" in Shinjuku. \n\nEdition 1/1\n\nSONY α6600\nISO 6400\n23 mm\n*f* / 4.0\n1/125 sec\n\n5656 × 3771 px\nJPG 8.72 MB",
