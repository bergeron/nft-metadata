    "description": "All I had was  a fraction of a second to capture this frame. These two were speeding through two different lanes, yet from the camera viewfinder, they appeared face to face. This was pure serendipity because I had no clue and my reflexes came in handy.\n\nFossil fuel vs Electric, I really don't know. I only wanted to present the moment.\n\n\n'Moods of Munroe' is a collection of 7 photographs.\n\nMunroe Island is a hidden pearl in the backwaters which is composed of a cluster of eight islands. The tranquil emotions of the mornings, wonderful warmth, and hues of the evenings entice me to this location. Even the passing trains give the location such a vibe.\n\nI hope you enjoy this 'Moods of Munroe' collection as much as I did photographing and presenting it to you!!\n\nAll images in this collection are 1/1.",
