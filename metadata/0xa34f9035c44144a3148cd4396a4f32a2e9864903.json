    "description": "\"Let's prick our fingertips and press them tightly against one another. The sensation is confusing but it's only on the other side of this endless impermanent state that the contract can be executed. If I give you my blood, will you give me clarity? If we both maim one another enough on our descent into love, will it be enough for you to move the stars?\n\nJust take my blood already! Take all that you need. These constellations grow tiresome and I want a new future.\"\n\n2686 px x 2735 px, 132 DPI\n",
