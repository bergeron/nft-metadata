    "description": "This photograph was taken inside the cooling tower of an abandoned power station in Belgium. This is one of my first published pieces of work, and the moment everything changed for me.  \n\nWe all face our own adversity.  Progress is not linear. It's important to keep your head up when you enter the valley of disappointment. If you're too focused on the past, you might miss some important moments in the present! \n\nThis is the first of many NFTs in the collection.  I plan on using any profits to support other small artists like myself. There is so much unrecognized talent in the photography world!\n\nCollectors will receive a signed 1/1 copy of a look book, as well as a t-shirt with the collection logo. ",
