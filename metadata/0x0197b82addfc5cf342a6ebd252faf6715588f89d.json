    "description": "Reality #1\n\nMy brain is neurodivergent; it doesn't create dopamine like others. Because of this, I don't experience the world around me like neurotypical people. This concept got me thinking about reality and how people perceive it- what's real & what is fantasy. Reality, as collection, is an over-exaggerated form of my reality: familiar & calm interiors; overstimulating and saturated exteriors.",
