    "description": "\"Satori | 「悟り」\" is a Japanese Buddhist term for awakening, \"comprehension; understanding\".\n\nBy extracting the color information from Ilan Derech's photography, \"Satori | 「悟り」\" generates a nonfigurative, abstract particle field system with over 30 million points, these translate different attributes pulled from the base piece (photograph), and assigns those values to the variables of the particle system in order to simulate physical properties, and therefore create a unique soothing motion.\n\n\"Satori | 「悟り」\" is an experimental project that draws inspiration from the natural flow of Japanese rivers, impressionist aesthetics, and recent digital media explorations.\n\nAs the title mentions, this is an awakening, a leap from a traditional medium to an endless flow of pure gesture bridging technology and nature.\n\n-\n\nBy: Ilan Derech\nCollection: Satori | 悟り- ETH\nMedium: Procedural Design\nYear: 2023",
