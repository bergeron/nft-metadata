    "description": "\"Clause and Effect” explores the mythology of Wu-Tang Clan’s album “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin”, of which only one copy was produced, and subsequently auctioned to the highest bidder. The winner of the auction was notorious Pharma-bro Martin Shkreli, who purchased the copy for $2m. The album came with a variety of clauses restricting its use and public accessibility. The idea of a single copy existing of an item that would normally find its value through massive copying and distribution was a fascinating study in scarcity and value, something that the nature of NFT’s addresses and accommodates.
