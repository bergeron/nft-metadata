    "description": "In a futuristic parallel universe, a society of humans have their lives manipulated by “THEM”. Using the media, “THEY” manipulate society to benefit from the citizens conformity and obedience. “THEY“ use fear and hate to distract their people from the real issues, and established a concept that keeps everyone occupied... Dreams.\nWith dreams, people work towards an end goal, a life of comparing themselves to others, a search for perfection, envy, and greed. But down in the gutter, the Depressed Citizens are awakening to reality. The similarity in their struggle has erased all their differences as they unite for the same purpose. A rebellion has started.\nDEPRESSED CITIZENS is motivated by a deep intent to wake up our society to social issues that are affecting us all. Issues that are often overlooked because they are so embedded in our lives that it is hard to accept that they are real. We intend to express those issues through ART, as it expresses itself as a form of civilized rebellion. We are not here to point fingers, but to open our eyes to social problems through creativity.\n Are we being manipulated?\n FIND OUT MORE AT: www.depressedcitizens.com",
