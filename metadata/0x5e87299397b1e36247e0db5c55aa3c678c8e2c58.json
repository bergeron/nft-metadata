    "description": "Do you still remember what dawn looks like? What it smells like? I guess you've already forgotten.\nDo you remember going to your grandmother's house as a child? Or watching the sunrise with your friends? It's a wonderful feeling. The feeling of freedom. As if you were present at the birth of something new. Completely different, unique.\nAnd sunsets? How beautiful they are.\nImagine a field warmed by the sun. And you're going to the country to relax with your family. There's a beautiful weekend ahead and a beautiful life.\nJust remember.",
