    "description": "This image was captured on new years day of 2022.\n\nAs I stood in the sands patiently waiting for the sunrise, I couldn't help but reflect on what had happened in the world for the last 2 years. I wanted this piece to reflected my thoughts and feelings of this moment. Years of being isolated from other countries, friends or even family at times - yet all still being connected by the sun and sand.\n\nThis piece is an 1/1 edition of the \"Focus\" series formulated during the peak of the recent pandemic. This series tells a story about the beauty of the world still waiting for us, even when time has been blurry.",
