    "description": "This song is the outro to my debut album \"Blink of an Eye\". It's truly a representation of growth and how fast everything can change. At times we feel like whatever is going on in our lives, whether it be bad or good, will last forever. But that's not the case. It's important to be in the moment and take everything in while you're here. \n\nI like to think of this song as an optimistic perspective of change. Welcoming change with an open heart, open mind & open arms. All in a blink of an eye. ;) \n\n-\nmia lailani <3 ",
