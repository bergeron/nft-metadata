    "description": "saudades #1 \na series of photography+ai amalgamations\n******\nSaudade is an untranslatable Portuguese word whose meaning is roughly conveyed as a feeling of \"melancholic longing or yearning\". However, that meaning is imperfect.  During the last year AI has totally transformed how we as humans think of art and its creation.  Recently, Ive become obsessed with taking my photographs and running them through AI.  The results, the interpretation of my photo by the AI algorithm are always interesting, unexpected, and sometimes beautiful--An amalgamation of my photographic vision with that of a computerized superbrain.  The DNA of the original photo is still there but it is now both present and gone, related but different and ultimately undefinable--just as the sense of \"saudade\" is impossible to totally put into words.",
