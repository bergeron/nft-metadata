    "description": "This is the first of a complete departure from the work I've known since I was child. It's currently 6:12am here in Lagos and this image and title came to mind as clear as the red circle you see in front of you. I've always been amazed at the simple and have tried many times over in getting to the core of what it is exactly I'm trying to say and do with my work. And this, this is it, I feel. The first step in what will be a long journey of iteration and finding, and getting lost again. I'm looking at it now, this painting, this simple piece of my life and handwork, distilled from many years of working and I feel comfortable and at peace--for the first time in a long time. I hope you get that feeling too. \n//The collector of this piece will also receive a signed 25 x32 inch oil canvas original by me.//",
