    "description": "House on Blooming Hill is a GAN-created image from my 2D Tempra cake paint base. With the use of DeepDreamGenerator, Adobe Suite, Procreate, through various photos, taken through my life journey, breathing life into this digital canvas. I drew the outlines and rendered the works within its Mis en Scène works on my iPad Pro in Procreate.\n\nShe had dreamt of him, and he knew her. They found each other through the either. It would have been perfect, tho he had to let her go. Still, they needed time and space to grow apart from each other. It broke his heart to banish her for his and her good. She had to create beautiful things and span the world, growing the seeded love he had panted within her heart. Watching it flutter from the first butterfly and pen drawing to the day, they both knew she couldn’t stop her from following her dreams.\n\nTo the love that will follow and the dreams achieved, I now share this love story for all to observe and see—blooming still until they meet again one day.",
