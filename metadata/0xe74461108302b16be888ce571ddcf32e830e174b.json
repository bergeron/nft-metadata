    "description": "1st piece from ''Body Hills'' collection\n\nDuring the creation process of every piece I love to play with the lighting, and I see parts and angles of a piece that nobody sees, as my pieces are created to show the bigger picture, not the zoom-ins of the body parts. Now this collection is about that ,to show you the minimalistic part of the beautiful light and shade. I love those angles and I wanted to share them with you.",
