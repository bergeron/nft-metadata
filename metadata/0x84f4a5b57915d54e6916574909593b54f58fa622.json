    "description": "The leap.\nWhen is the last time you took a leap of faith?\n\nLife is full of unknowns.  Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to follow a path where the destination is unclear.  This often much of life. Letting go and allowing yourself the permission to simply try can change your life.  The good, the bad - we will always be on a path whether we see it right away or not.  Keep moving forward and donâ€™t be scared to take the leap.  \n\nA mysterious path floats into the unknown of the winter landscape.\n\nThis image is minted in celebration of 1 year since Sara Boychuk joined the NFT space as an artist.  This 1/1 image was taken in Banff National Park, Canada during a -50Celsius day. \n",
