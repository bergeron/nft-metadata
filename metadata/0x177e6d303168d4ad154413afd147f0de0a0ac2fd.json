    "description": "It took me 42 days to make this photo;\nIt had to be a day without rain, considering that in the North of Patagonia it rains an average of 270 days a year, it was a difficult task.\nIn addition to that, it had to be a very cold day, so  the lake would condense the humidity of it and causing that fog that looks like floating over it. \nBesides that, I had to be lucky enough a fisherman decided to go out at that time and with that cold and crossing paths with the wake left by the rising sun on the lake.\nThat perfect day happened on the last day of April. In my hometown, Puerto Varas, North Patagonia , Chile \n\n1/1  Edition ",
