    "name": "Derivative Art of Cool Girl NFT #014",
    "description": "For me, Cool Girl NFT #014 has a particularly strong \"white\" image in the CoolGirlNFT collection, and it is a work that gave me the impression that it \"cannot be dyed with any color\".\n\nIn creating this derivative art, I was conscious of expressing the season of summer while following the impression of the original #014 and the costume designed by https://twitter.com/seeen_nft\n\nI have her holding a blue rose in this derivative art. This comes from her blue shirt worn by the original #014.\n\nBlue roses did not exist until recently, so they were once considered to symbolize \"impossible\", but now they have the flower language of \"dreams come true\", \"miracle\", and \"divine blessing\".\n\nIn addition, blue roses also have flower language such as \"love at first sight\" and \"mysterious\".\n\nI hope that when you look at this derivative art, you will get the impression of these flower languages.\n\n--\n\nâ—†Derivative art source:\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/coolgirlnft\n\n2828*4000pixel, 350dpi, PNG",
