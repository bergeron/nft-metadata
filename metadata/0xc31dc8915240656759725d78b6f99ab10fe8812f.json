    "description": "In this piece I've tried to show the heavy atmosphere one may create (unintentionally) after experiencing a great pain or loss. And surrounding him/herself with memories. But as we know memories can cause the further and ultimate damage. That's the process I'd like to call \"the sinking\". Not drowning because you don't just drown but you sink with all of your belongings. You sink like a ship.\n\n33Ã—33 cm\nmixed media on mdf board \n2021",
