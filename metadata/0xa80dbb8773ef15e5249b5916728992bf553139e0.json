GLC-256 stands for GOOD LUCK CHARM-256 and the collection consists of 256 unique hash sequences, rooted in the SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm. SHA-256 is used to mine bitcoin and it is utilized in other popular encryption protocols as well as in operating systems such as LINUX. Each and every GOOD LUCK CHARM is an image of a phrase encrypted in SHA-256 and displayed in UNICODE, a universal character encoding standard. All of the NFTs in the GLC-256 collection contain something to the extent of a good fortune, an affirmation, or a poetic statement that manifests positivity. Anyone that collects & holds a GLC-256 NFT in their wallet might be rewarded with GOOD LUCK",
