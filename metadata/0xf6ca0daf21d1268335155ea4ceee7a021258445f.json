    "description": "Mixture of textures present in the urban environment. The roughness of rust proof paint, the warmth of bricks, and the softness of plants all come together to create a visually dynamic and interesting space. My work aims to capture and highlight the beauty found in the contrasts of the city. The smoothness of glass and metal buildings in contrast with the roughness of a brick wall, the naturalness of a park amidst the man-made architecture.\n---------------\nThis token represent ownership of the physical piece, bid in this page if you intent to take the artwork home.\nnfa owner of this token may tokenize this nft \n---------------\n@gua_s\nwinter_2023\n\nOriginal on shown at: \nCosmic Cat Cafe\n170E E 2nd St, \nNY 10009",
