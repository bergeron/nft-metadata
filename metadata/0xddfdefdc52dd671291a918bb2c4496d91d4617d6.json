    "description": "A PRIORI 001 ft. Oneil Sandiford\n\nForms is an ongoing abstract photography project that aims to \nquestion self-identity through existential portraiture.  \nIt represents our inner selves through out-of-body experiences. \nAn assemblance of our thoughts, beliefs and understandings \nmanifested through our exteriors.  It is a deconstruction \nof the centralized self, an admittance of the unintelligible \nand a search for similarities in the paradox.\n\nEach image is made entirely in-camera \nusing multiple exposures on a single sheet of 8x10 film.\n\n No post-processing is used in the creations.  \n As such, the negatives are in their final Forms.\n\nThis NFT is a digital drum scan created to accompany its original negative, housed in a custom fabricated lightbox frame for physical display.",
