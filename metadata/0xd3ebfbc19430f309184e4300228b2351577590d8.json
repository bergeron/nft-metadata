    "description": "Waking up for the sunrise is always epic. Or that's how the pictures make it look like. Truth is waking up is a struggle but the rewards, that's something else. \n\nEarly morning at the Malindi Pier, known as the long tongue that flicks into the Indian Ocean, just as I was bringing back the drone so that we can head back to the hotel, the shadows falling off the bridge calling my name. \n\"Just one last shot\"\n\nFirst shot. I pause for a few seconds. \nThe frame is cool but I feel something is missing. A light bulb moment happens. My shadow which I told myself I'd fix in Photoshop, ends up tickling my fancy. \nI frame my friends for what would be the birth of The Three Musketeers.\n\n\n\n\nEdition: 13/13  \nTitle: THREE MUSKETEERS  \nLocation: Malindi Kenya  \nPhotographer: Trevor Maingi   \nSize: 4275 x 3054 @300dpi  \n\n\nLicenses:  \n‚ÄçNFT Holder Can display in virtual galleries, privately and in groups , and essays provided proper crediting is done.
