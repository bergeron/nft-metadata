    "description": "All of us have roots. Whether it's our homelands, our ancestors, our cultural backgrounds. In times of a globalized world, we often choose to hide them. We form some sort of attractive image to please those around us.\n\nThe powerful roots of the swamp cypresses in these photos are always hidden under water. Floating among them in a canoe, I gazed out at the beautiful crowns. In the rays of the morning sun they seem perfect. But only when we're underwater can we know where they really grow and draw their life power from.\n\nAs I moved deeper and deeper into the grove with each stroke of my paddle, I thought more and more about the roots.\n\nThis collection is inspired by thoughts about our origins. About the impact it has on all of us. About our collective deep roots. About human nature and its place on Earth.",
