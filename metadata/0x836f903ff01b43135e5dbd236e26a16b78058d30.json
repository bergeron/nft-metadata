    "description": "The Year is 2049. In a far-flung corner of the milky way, on the planet F1lthyR1ch, the Great Fruit War has finally come to an end. Following the peachiest conflict ever seen in the galaxy, the Banana Family reign supreme. Now the rulers of all F1lthyR1ch, they had more money than they knew what to do with. Somehow, though, life seemed just a little bit dull. That is, until one day they decided to climb aboard their spaceships on a tour of their new world. Looking down upon all the other fruits of their kingdom, the Bananas could not keep down a wry smile. Now they knew what had to be done: it was time to start balling.",
