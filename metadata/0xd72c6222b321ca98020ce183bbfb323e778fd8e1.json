    "description": "Woman is God’s supreme creation. Only after the earth had been formed, after the day had been separated from the night, after the waters had been divided from the land, after vegetation and animal life had been created, and after man had been placed on the earth, was woman created and only then was the work pronounced complete and good.\n\nOf all the creations of the Almighty, there is none more beautiful, none more inspiring than a lovely daughter of God who walks in virtue with an understanding of why she should do so, who honors and respects her body as a thing sacred and divine, who cultivates her mind and constantly enlarges the horizon of her understanding, who nurtures her spirit with everlasting truth.\n\n“God will hold us accountable if we neglect His daughters.”\n\nOil painting on canvas, 2022\n80x60\nreserve price for NFT\nbuy price for the original oil painting ",
