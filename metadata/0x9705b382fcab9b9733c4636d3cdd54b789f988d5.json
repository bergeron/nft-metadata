    "description": "Chromatica Ordinals is an art collection by Resaang, a collection that transcends digital and physical boundaries and showcases the intersections of technology, art and human creativity on a canvas and an NFT.\n\nThe project exists at the crossroads of art and blockchain but also challenges the way we perceive and value art. A very physical medium of acrylic paint immortalized in Block 78 SATs. The Chromatica experience is both digital and physical. ETH token holders will receive the digital art piece, physical art piece, and an ordinal upon burning of the ETH token.\n\nETH art by hachimi.eth",
