    "description": "It seems to me that now the era of public censure has come. People are condemned both in real life and on the Internet, for various reasons because of explicit photos, because of their views on various socio-political topics, because of the clothes they wear, because of their love for informal music, etc. e. With this photo, I tried to convey my vision of this problem.\n\nThis work has visited several exhibitions in 8 countries and received the following awards:\n- Red Garnet statuette of the Golden winner from Muse awards\n- Gold medal from FIAP\n- Three gold medals from PSA\n- Gold medal from Quintet 2021\n- Silver medal from South Asian Circuit\n- Bronze medal from Quintet\n- Chairman Choice medal from South Asian International Circuit\n- FIAP Ribbon\n- PSA Ribbon\n- Salon Ribbons",
