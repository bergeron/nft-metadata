    "description": "Learning Houdini has been my biggest ongoing art project over the past year.  It’s a big complicated beast of a program that is far different than anything I’ve ever used before.    It's pretty far outside my comfort zone but being a 3D artist is about challenging yourself and always learning new techniques.\n\nThere’s a lot to learn but it is capable of creating scenes and geometry that would be very difficult to attempt using Blender or Lightwave.\n\n\"Connections\" was very much a learning exercise but I always want these exercises to also produce usable artwork for the desktop.   I am quite pleased with how this project turned out and I'm excited to dig even deeper into Houdini going forward.",
