    "description": "LATENT COUTURE is a collection of 555 AI fashion statements generated from photographs of Woodbridge's years of experience as a performer, painter, designer, and nightlife icon. The opposite of a deepfake, this mode of generative AI reaches into the latent space to find the deepreal. Each image branches from a moment in Woodbridge's life, articulating ephemeral threads and potential ways of being. Developed from the concept that 'a look is a meme,' each of these fashion statements says, 'This person is possible.'",
