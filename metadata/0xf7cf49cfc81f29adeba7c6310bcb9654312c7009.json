    "description": "Hey sound.xyz community! I’m Pham and I’ve been making music since 2010. I’m excited to join you here from Poland and show you “Mantra”.\n\nI wrote “Mantra” having in mind certain relationships and also experiences of isolation. It’s hard when certain people leave your life and sometimes it’s you that no longer can maintain.\n\nAt times I escaped into solitude, so called self-care. While it’s usually good, sometimes it’s easy to burn the bridges instead of confrontation - we push people away to protect ourselves - and sometimes that becomes our mantra, even if things get better. And I’ve seen spiritual people who weren’t that spiritual in the end.        It’s my second performance as a vocalist, and I want to invite you on my journey in making actual songs, not only instrumentals. I’m thrilled to hear what you think.\n",
