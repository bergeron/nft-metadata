    "description": "Walking through a freshly coated trail to see one of the most beautiful waterfalls that i have ever seen. walking through the forest I never could have imagined what I was about so stumble upon because I've been here multiple times but never in the winter. the silence of the walk was finally met by the intense sound of crashing water. I was in awe, completely overwhelmed by the pure beauty of the falls. my connection with this location has always been so strong due to it being a second home for me. my yells being muffled by the sound of the waterfall has always been so comforting just a place to go and forget all of my problems.",
