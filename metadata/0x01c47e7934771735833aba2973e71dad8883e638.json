    "description": "Claim your dolphin here: https://app.manifold.xyz/c/dolphinsfree\n\nAs a photographer, I have always been moved by the beauty and intelligence of dolphins. So when I had the opportunity to photograph one up close and personal, in 2010, I knew that this was a once in a lifetime chance. The photo I captured that day was of a dolphin underwater, its eyes full of life and curiosity, a gentle expression and the way its eyes seemed to be asking for help. In the same time, it was like he was smiling to me. It was a breathtaking sight and I felt a strong connection with this animal.  \nBut as I looked at the photo, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness and frustration. The dolphin was a captive animal, being held in an aqua park for people's entertainment. And I knew that this was not the life this majestic creature deserved. I felt a deep urge to do something, to make a difference.  \nThat's when I decided to use this photo as a way to raise awareness about the plight of captive dolphins. These intelligent and majestic creatures deserve to be free, not held in captivity for human amusement. And so, I shared the photo with the world, hoping that it would speak to people's hearts and minds, and inspire them to take action to protect these animals.  \nThis photo remains one of my most famous, and I am proud of the impact it has had in creating awareness about the treatment of dolphins in captivity. It is a reminder that as photographers, we have the power to use our art to make a difference in the world. And I will always strive to use my photography to shed light on important issues and to make the world a better place for all living beings. But more than that, it is a call to action, a reminder that each and every one of us has the power to make a difference, to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves, and to work towards a better future for all living creatures.\n\nEyes that Speak: A Dolphin's Cry for Freedom \n**EVERY 10000 sales I will make an important donation to some amazing organizations fighting to save our oceans and I will also make an NFT with the proof of donation.**",
