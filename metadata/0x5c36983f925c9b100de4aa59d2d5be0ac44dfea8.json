    "description": "The past and the future are different. Causes come before effects. Pain comes after the wound, not before. A glass is broken into a thousand and one pieces, but a thousand and one pieces cannot rebuild the glass. We cannot change the past; we can have regrets, sorrows, memories of happiness. But the future is uncertainty, desire, anxiety, open space, perhaps destiny. We can live it, shape it with our choices, because it does not yet exist; anything is possible... Time is not a line with two equal directions; it is an arrow with different ends.",
