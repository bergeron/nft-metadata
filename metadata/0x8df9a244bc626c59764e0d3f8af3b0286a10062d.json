    "name": "California Shoe Rush",
    "description": "The California Shoe Rush, which began in 1848, was a pivotal event that sparked a massive migration of people to California in search of shoes, setting off a frenzy of excitement and dreams of quick riches. \n\nThousands of prospectors, known as \"Air Forcers\" traveled from all over the world to California, enduring treacherous journeys and hardships in hopes of comforting their feet. The shoe rush not only had a profound impact on California's population and economy but also played a significant role in shaping American history as it spurred westward expansion and forever altered the social fabric of the region.",
