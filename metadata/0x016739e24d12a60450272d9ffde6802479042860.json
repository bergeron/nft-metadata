    "description": "Good Society 006: Vindata - Mamis\n\nVindata is one of those artists who we've been listening to since before our journey in the music industry and we're honored to debut him here in web3 with 'Mamis'. We've always admired his soulful and sonically eclectic approach to dance music which encapsulates a sound that is distinctly his. He's collaborated with artists such as Anderson .Paak, Skrillex, Mija, & Wax Motif with records signed to OWSLA, Monstercat, and more.\n\n\"The track 'Mamis' is a song that I've been rinsing in my DJ sets for some time now. I've always considered it a white label track, so I'm honored to now share it as an NFT. At the time of making it, I was thinking I wanted to create something a bit edgier but at mid-tempo BPM. I wanted to Juxtapose something smooth but slightly grimey too. And I love how it came out. I'm really excited to share this!\"\n- Vindata\n\nWe Live in a Good Society â†’ guild.xyz/goodsociety",
