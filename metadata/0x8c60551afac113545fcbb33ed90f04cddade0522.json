    "description": "that day rain poured in shades of green,\nand heavenâ€™s anguish brought angels to their knees.\n\nsweet nothings started sounding like mantras\nas desire and innocence ignored the moon\n\ni was a child who only knew pleasure and pain,\ntossed into winds of hope and imagination.\n\nwhen the sun became a supernova\nhis muse took flight across a lifetime of oceans,\naccompanied only by satori and the void.",
