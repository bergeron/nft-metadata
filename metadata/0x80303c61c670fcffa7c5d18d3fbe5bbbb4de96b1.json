    "description": "Often we don't understand what we are feeling in the moment and how to experience it. It is always a storm of emotions simmering inside us. The most vivid feelings we experience when we fall in love. There is fear, tenderness and love for the person, warmth, and sometimes pain and disappointment. You have to be able to live them, feel them, and accept them. ",
