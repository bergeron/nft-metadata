    "description": "The main concept of this art is about the death of the Cat, which should not happen and seems to be miserably unfair. It is because the Cat was cruelly bit to death by the Big Dog. Sadly, I witnessed this entire tragic scene but couldn't help. My sadness was turned into ange. So, I wanted to create this art to dedicate to the Cat, sending him peacefully back Cat Star. I wanted to demonstrate the result of the action or Karma. Although nothing happens as yet, Karma will bring back in circle someday.",
