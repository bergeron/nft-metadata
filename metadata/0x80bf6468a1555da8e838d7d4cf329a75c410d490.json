    "description": "The Antimatter Inscriptions is a collection on Ethereum that is given to the first direct purchasers of the 5 Ordinal pieces inscribed on Bitcoin.\n\nFor more information, visit antimatter.nullish.org.\n\n\nCollection Description:\n\nAntimatter features a large array of vibrating squares and circles that pulse in an imperfect synchronicity. The effect is both calming and dizzying, as the viewer is drawn into a hypnotic world of rhythm and movement.\n\nA fully on-chain, hand-typed generative art project that explores the abstract concept of antimatter through visual chaos, forever etched on the Bitcoin blockchain as Ordinals.",
