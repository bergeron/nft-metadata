    "description": "I had been thinking of an illustration to submit to FND for a long time.\n\nI drew illustrations that included the background and illustrations that included the characters, but I could not come up with anything that satisfied me.\nI like to draw cute girl characters.\n\nSo I decided to animate the moment when a girl feels the cutest.\nAnimation is not an easy thing to do because it requires many drawings.\nIt took me a long time to draw this blinking moment of the cutest girl.\nI hope you will make eye contact with her.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
