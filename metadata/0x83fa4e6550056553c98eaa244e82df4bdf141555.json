    "description": "2023 - video - 8” - 1792 x 1792\n\nThe first collector that owns both NFT’s, Hong and Kong, will be airdropped the full video ‘Hong Kong’ as a third NFT.\n\nThe video is made for the occasion of the 2023 Art Basel edition in Hong Kong and shows an imaginary harbour scene, possibly in Hong Kong. Blending elements, referring to Chinese culture, are virtually placed together by a European artist, hoping to achieve historical and geographical consistency. The risk of being exposed by local viewers is a reality the artist is willing to take.\nThe Chinese characters that are visible in the video stand for Art Innovation Gallery.\nThe video is part of ‘The Sound of Pixels’ that takes place from 17 to 24 March 2023 and can be seen on a 70+ meter wide LED screen along the Causeway Bay in Hong Kong.",
