    "description": "I chose sunflower in this composition because it is so holy and powerful. The yellow colour of the sunflower brings me happiness and peace. It brings a smile to my face.\n\nThe skeleton is used here because it symbolizes death.\n\nThe meaning is somewhat abstract. But It is something in the lines of the sunflower giving me light to find my way in the darkness.",
