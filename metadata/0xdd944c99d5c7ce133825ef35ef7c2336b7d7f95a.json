    "description": "Artist: Farshid Ahmadpour ᴺᶠᵀ ©️\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nCollector will receive printable Tiff format file.\n\nI seek solace in her arms, to distance myself from the evil of the city. when the mountains and plains which are like an old woman regain their lost beauty, it is filled with silence and peace.I solace in the warmth of eternal embrace; When this dreamy transgressor goes through a thousand ways and finally all the ways are solitude and loneliness. This collection includes 20 photo frames. These photos are my attempts to capture winter and the relationship between snow, trees and humans during five years. I will send the original and large file in TIFF format to the buyer of this photo.",
