Amongst the drifter are those who promotes and ensure passing their cultural heritage to different communities even in their business life. In this picture is a horse rider who moves from different part of the Northern Nigeria to attend cultural events which promotes the horse riding skills to different community which would later become a lifestyle of the people in that community.",
