The light has a soft warm glow to it, you breathe in fresh air. „Dawn of Day“ for me represents the beginning of something new and exciting, a new day, new opportunities, freedom and pure energy.\n\n1/1600 sec  \nf/6.3  \nISO 504  \n122mm \n\n\n6400 x 3600 px\n\nAugust 2019  \nSong-Kul, Kyrgyzstan\n\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to display the NFT privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, as long as the creator is credited.
