    "description": "Once the queen of her tribe, she decided to abandon this position to become a Guardian of the flowers. She lived on top of the most illuminated mountain in the region. The landscape was simply beautiful, the sun fell directly on the surface, making each plant shine, it was like a festival of lights. One day this place fell under the curse of an evil witch and the beautiful light turned into something harmful to the plants. The flowers began to wither and sadness took over that place. The queen had no choice but to face the witch thus saving the flowers. Since then she lives to protect the life of the flowers.",
