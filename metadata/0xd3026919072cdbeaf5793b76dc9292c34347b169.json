    "description": "My work is defined by the concepts I examine. I always think about objects that are abandoned or disposed of after being used for a single purpose.  Most of my photograms incorporate flowers, props that were thrown away after photoshoots.  I am drawn to the irony of these beautiful things deemed disposable the second they no longer serve their primary purpose.\n\nThis is my work 'Cyan flower'\n\n*I made this work with an analog technique called photogram.",
