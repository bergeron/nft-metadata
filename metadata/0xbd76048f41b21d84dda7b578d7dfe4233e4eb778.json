    "description": "‘Divine Bonds’ depicts fallen angels intertwining in the hug of infinity on the threshold of light and darkness, these two beings rest together, as one. \n\nThey are divided and united, fragile and strong. \nThe artwork has the intent to convey that the triumph of light over darkness is inspiring, however we may not always confront these adversities. We can witness how life and love are inextricably entwined through suffering and sacrifice – two sides of a shared grace which makes life worth living.",
