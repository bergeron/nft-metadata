    "description": "This mandala is named and depicts Passion.  \nBeing passionate about something is a very intense and powerful feeling which is represented by this very intricate mandala, replete with uniquely crafted patterns and bright colours in between. The more you   see, the more patterns you'll find. \nTo me, passion is something I absolutely love doing and enjoy and immerse myself in, throughout the process. \nAs my first artwork on Foundation, I pondered a lot about what to create. But then I took a minute and asked myself what I love passionately and it was easy. Mandala Patterns. So, hereâ€™s presenting to you - Passion ! \n",
