    "description": "Inspired by Hopper's \"Woman in the Sun\", this piece is created with vectors. Simple, sharp-edged, and a subdued blue color compliments the yearning feeling of the room, and completes it with an illustration on the wall from the past.\n\nAll participants will be receiving an edition of the illustration on the wall separately after the auction ends.",
