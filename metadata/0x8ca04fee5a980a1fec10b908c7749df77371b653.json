    "description": "The Golden hour at Key Monastery is one of the best things I have experienced by far. Sunsets are always the best time and I try my best to capture the best of them. The feeling of setting sun that brings an unknown calmness in the heart and lightness to the mind is beyond. I always go into a meditative state when I am surrounded by the force of nature and how could I not witness it through my lens. The air is so magical here, the water so pure, the lights that guide you home.\n\nSize- 7690 × 5129\n300DPI\nLocation - Spiti valley, Himachal Pradesh\nYear- 2022",
