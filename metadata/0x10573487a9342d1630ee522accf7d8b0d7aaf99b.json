    "description": "Northeast Beacons is a collection of photographs paying homage to the lighthouses that have guided vessels along the coast of Maine for well over 100 years. \n\nI’ve always been enamored by these beautiful structures and their rich histories. Every time I visit these lighthouses I feel as if I’m almost looking into the past. If the walls could talk, imagine the stories they’d tell.\n\nImages in this collection were taken on film and digital mediums.\n\nAll Photos are 1/1\n\n\n",
