    "description": "We are quick to judge with our eyes when instead we should let our hearts lead us.\n\nA troubled life with bumps along the road creates scars and defence mechanisms. Pain introduces barbed wires either through our own doing in hopes of protecting ourselves or done by the world to box us in.\n\nWe remain human though and humans are meant to love. Through these barb wires we carry our heart and eagerly look to share it with the world.\n\nPeace through the pain. Peace through the adversity. Love above all.",
