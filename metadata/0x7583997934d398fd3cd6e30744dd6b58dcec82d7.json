Count the unlimited shining stars, whisper wishes to the moon and connect with yourself. Touch the power of your heart chakra, listen to its beating… You are alive! Gratitude. Alignment. You are at peace and in harmony with nature. One with the Universe.” \n-- Trace, after the heist, 2.2.2222 \n\n4912x7360 px \n300 dpi \n\nModel: Carolina Franco \nMake-up: Bia Medeiros",
