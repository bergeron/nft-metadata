    "description": "Evolution is the topic which has stirred the debate since the origin of the very idea. It is said that apes are one of the close relatives of human kind. This  'Thinking ape' looks like an ancestor thinking upon an idea among many which made them into us through evolution. Who would have thought that the apes would once become Humans and the woods around them would be the society which we live in today! Evolution has changed many things. Or has not? What do you think basically differentiates fighting, enjoying and surviving human in our world from the fighting, enjoying and surviving ape in jungle? \n\nPlease welcome NFT universe's most famous mascot.",
