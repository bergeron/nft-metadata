    "description": "Legend states that the Southern Mountains of Jabbokanan are blessed by the presence of a saintly, sentient entity called Momo the Mook. \n\nBelievers claim that, for a thousand years, this mysterious being has maintained the youthfulness of his body by abstaining from the distractions of the world. His abode is a simple cave, where he contemplates the evolution of sentient life.\n\nThroughout history, various adventurers claimed they met and spoke with the ancient sage. However, until the expedition of Adi Malawi Neen, there was no hard evidence to prove his existence. Malawi claims her journey to the Sacred Mountains took three years, during which time she interviewed the Mook, recording his words on film to preserve his wisdom.\n\nThese films form the doctrines of a spiritual movement that Malawi promotes. It must be added that the existence of Momo is yet to be independently verified. There are those who say Malawi is a fraud and that Momo is merely an actor portraying a myth.",
