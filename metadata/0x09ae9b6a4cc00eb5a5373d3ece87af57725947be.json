    "description": "When I first moved to Japan, I was walking around the city and came across the Meiji Shrine. The weather suddenly turned bad - it started to rain and thunder. It's an unusual experience to wait out bad weather in such a religious place. It was as if the local gods had opened an umbrella over you. As the rain subsided, I began to take photographs, one of which managed to get a woman with an umbrella in the frame. A lone figure in the middle of a vast deserted russet square. It was the beginning of the pandemic, so there were very few people outside. It is a rarity today to have almost no people in that place. This photo later won an internal competition at my design college. It is one of my favourite photos and perfectly describes the word 'loneliness'.\nSincerely, Kodoku Tabibito.",
