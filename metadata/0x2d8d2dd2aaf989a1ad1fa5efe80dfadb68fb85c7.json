    "description": "A young Afronaut woman internalizes the wisdom of the West African adinkra principle and concept of Sankofa to find inner peace and balance. \n\nThe adinkra sankofa is a part of a family of symbols and semiotics originating from the Akan, Ewe and Ga people of Ghana each one has a story, proverbial principle and symbol associate with them. The sankofa principle is about remembering to learn from the ancestors and from one's internal spiritual compass. \n\nIt is with hope that the owner of this visual treasure will also find balance with themselves and in return manifest it in their world around them. \n\nThis is the first art piece of a 3 part series pertaining to finding and maintaining \"balance\" of the mind, spirit and heart.
