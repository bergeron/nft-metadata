    "description": "Years of fear and humiliation brought you no good, let's get the pain bejewelled, and worn like a survivor. You are your own muse and your own applause.  \n\nThis NFT is all about #metoo, the survivors and how they have come back stronger than ever before. The road to recovery is always very hard but still rewarding. So don't hide your pain, let it shine, one way or another. ",
