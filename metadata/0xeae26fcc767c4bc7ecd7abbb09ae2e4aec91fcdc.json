    "description": "AI, Digital, 2023\n\nShip ahoy! The Lovely Boat comprises 25 portraits taken aboard an imaginary Caribbean cruise in 1993. The collection explores humanityâ€™s ongoing search for eternal happiness. Even within the seemingly Utopian environment of a luxury vacation, subtle glimpses of blemish, both emotional and physical, make us regrettably accept that no life can ever be perfect. \n\nAll work copyright Snerko 2023.
