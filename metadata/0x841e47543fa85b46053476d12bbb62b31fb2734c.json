    "description": "Digital Multi-Ai Art\n\nWhen reading about the earliest surviving Human literature; the Epic of Gilgamesh \nI was struck by how similar us Humans react emotionally to tragic heroic and dramatic events - \n\nWe have not changed\nUs humans will always have the same set of emotions. \n\nBut rather than looking at the past for answers I project my angst on technology & accelerationism into the future,\nI find it reassuring to face my worst nightmares, maybe that way I'll get used to them (before they happen)\n\nWith my work i try to depict the very dark advent of an AI super-intelligence & machine supremacy.\n\nImage Description\n>Organic Matter Creation by Machine\n\nThe essence of this series isn’t about technology, it is about what you feel when facing abstract sights of the future. \nAt the core, it’s about Humans, their Experience and their Instincts.\n",
