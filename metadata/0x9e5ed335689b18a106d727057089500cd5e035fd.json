    "description": "As we encounter new people in the world, our hope is that we attract the same energy that we emit. The more we surround ourselves with this energy, the stronger the energy becomes, allowing a greater reach.\n\nMay you attract others that share your energy.\n\nAbout Flow Therapy:  \nThis series was created based on photographs taken at Antelope Canyon in Arizona, USA. These slot canyons were formed over thousands of years of water flowing through the southwestern desert and exist as a testament to the power, beauty and serenity of nature.\n\nEach image was enhanced with Adobe Lightroom.",
