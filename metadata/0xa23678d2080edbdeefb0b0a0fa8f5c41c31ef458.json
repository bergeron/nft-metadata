    "name": "Pixel Harvest",
    "description": "\"Pixel Harvest\" is a fanciful look at how pixels are \"grown\"\nfor use in digital art. The work captures the early stages of pixels forming after germination. A lone pixel left over from the harvest lays in an early stage of decay. \n\n1/1 edition - still image | 9920 x 2120 pixels*\nMixed media; 3D render with digital enhancement.\nInspired by a combination of contemporary NFT art styles\n\n*Unusually large size; a benefit of dealing direct with the Pixel Farmers. \n\n100% of sale, after network and dealer expenses will go toward purchase of #NFTCommunity Artists and their artwork. Artwork purchased will then be gifted to talented artists identified in the #etherstulist. So, please consider donating with your heart in support of the #NFTartist community.\n\nThe artist acknowledges the many pixlel farmers who worked tirelessly to grow, harvest clean and prepare the pixels for this piece.
