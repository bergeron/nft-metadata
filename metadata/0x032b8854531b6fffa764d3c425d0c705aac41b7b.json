That’s me\n\nWho’s gonna touch you better? That’s me\n\nWhen you’re done with second rate fucks you know just where to come \n\nI’ll make you come whenever\n\nWhy would I be jealous?\n\nI know I hit the spots that he could never ever \n\nYou say now don’t you stop but I could go forever \n\nRemind you who’s on top when we get back together \n\nBaby it don’t change a thing \n\nBaby it don’t change a thing \n\nWhen you come into town \n\nAnd no-one is around \n\nThat’s all that really matters, that’s all I care about \n\nYou can have a man at home \n\nBut when we’re in my bed alone\n\nIt’s no concern to me and baby it don’t change a thing ",
