    "description": "Standing on the coast of Rhode Island waiting for the milky way to rise, my boots crunched the top of icy sand and snow drifts. The ocean’s winter breeze determined to find its way underneath my layers, I focused on nothing but my breath as I reflected on so much of what brought me to that moment.   \n\nThis piece holds the courage I’ve gained and the optimism I have for who I’m growing into.  \n\nIt holds the joy I've found in learning new skills. \n\nIt holds the beauty of patience, planning and practice.  \n\nIt holds answers.",
