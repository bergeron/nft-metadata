    "name": "They met to see the future",
    "description": "As they sat outside their trailers in the desert, they looked up at the stars and talked about the future. They talked about how the world was changing so quickly and how it was hard to keep up.\n\nBut as they looked into each otherâ€™s eyes, they knew that they could face anything together. They knew that their love was strong enough to withstand anything that the world could throw at them.\n\nAs they watched the stars twinkle above them, they knew that they were part of something much bigger than themselves. They were part of a world that was constantly changing, but their love remained constant.\n\nThey held hands and watched as the stars danced above them. They knew that no matter what happened in the future, they would always be together.",
