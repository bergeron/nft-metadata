    "description": "With a brewing storm in the background, the bones of a lone tree stood out prominently in a seemingly lost and forgotten Martian landscape. \n\nSnags (dead trees) provide vital habitats for thousands of species of wildlife. Thus, wherein lies death, life begins anew. As the first piece minted in this Genesis collection, this piece represents my birth into the beautifully creative world of professional photography.\n\nPhoto was captured May 3rd, 2022 in the Canyonlands National Park in southeastern Utah.",
