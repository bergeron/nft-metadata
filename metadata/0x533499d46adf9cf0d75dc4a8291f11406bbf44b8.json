    "description": "Journeying spirit and warden of the alpine lowlands.  She wanders her realm helping wounded creatures and ensuring the fine balance of all life around her.      \n\nI'm hoping to kick start a bit of seasonal cheer by offering this very special piece as an open edition.  This is one of my all time favourite and most popular works.  I am really happy to offer it to as many people as possible for what I think is an affordable price.  Gift to your friends or to yourself.  If you're still here, you deserve it!\n\n**Mint x 1 or more**  - Entered into draw to win 1 of 10 'Bloom' rabbit enamel pins.\n\n**Mint x 2 or more** - Entered into draw to win 1 of 3 signed A3 giclee prints of the art.\n\n**Mint x 3 or more** - Entered into draw to win signed original A2 ink work (some tape marks from lightbox at the top but if framed will look fine) AND A2 giclee print of the finished art.\n\nThank you for all of your support over the last year, whether that be likes, retweets, kind comments and advice and of course, collecting my art.  It means the world to me to have true creative freedom in what I do and to share it with you all.\n\nMat",
