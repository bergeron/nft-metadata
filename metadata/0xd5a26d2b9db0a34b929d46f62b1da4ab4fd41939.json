    "description": "During my post-processing phase, I am considering several ways to present my thought in a more concise manner. Finally, I came up with the concept of a false colour combination that may be accomplished using Lightroom's techniques. Drone shots tend to be more truthful than other types of photography since because we are photographing from the top perspective view, there will be no hidden layers to conceal anything. I don't want these images to be associated with a certain location or region; how can I accomplish that? As for me, I don't want to see much manipulation in my photographs, either. Then I came up with the idea for this layer of abstraction. A layer of abstraction will result in a global representation rather than a representation of a specific area, region, or country. Each of these photographs should represent a different deforested or disturbed location around the world.\n\nDimension: 5000 x 3164 300dpi",
