    "description": "In a magical room Lady Nature presents her treasure. She carries it in a black cloth bag. Satisfied, the head of the creature with the golden horn nestles in her right hand. It looks a little tired but feels secure.\n\nIn the background are two flamingos. On one of them rides a naughty little monkey. The burning candles bathe the room in a pleasant light. The white doves coo softly.\n\nWith her pompous headdress, the mysterious, beautiful woman proudly shows her attachment and love for nature, to which special care must be taken.\n\n1/1 handpainted, digital artwork\n\nCreator: Barbara Johanna Billeiter alias Duckylemon\n",
