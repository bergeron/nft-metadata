    "description": "Glitched Apes4Good are the rarest species on the blockchain: 15,000 unique apes conceived and developed to transparently give 100% of sales to charity.  The collection is divided evenly, 1000 1/1 glitches of each of the 15 inspirational figures. Proceeds from sales to Endaoment.org on the blockchain, converted to USDC and transferred to https://app.endaoment.org/funds/apes4good to donate to US registered charities.",
