    "description": "HEY ALL! Let us introduce you to 2MINUTES\n\nfirst of all:\n\nit just got PREMIERED ON BBC FEB 25th 2023!!\n\n- CARLIE -\nWe linked up over Instagram and started sending different ideas to each other and I think because our styles complimented one another so nicely the song just came together really naturally. I wrote this song about how I got so used to turbulence in my life, that when I finally found a state of calm I seemed to try and self sabotage all the time. It was almost as if I didn’t know how to sit in that comfortable safe space, or didn’t feel like I even deserved it. I love being able to exercise emotions through writing songs, it's super cathartic and way cheaper than therapy!\n\n- Dabow -\nI first heard CARLIE's amazing voice on a song of hers called \"Highs and Lows\", then reached out to her and was like \"yooooooo let's collab i love ur music!\". She was down from the start so we simply went for it. I showed her a wip's playlist I had, and she was like \"send this one!\" (this was march 2021). Vocals were spot on from the start. Track originally was more \"trappy\" but then started mutating and became a mix between house and trap and baile. \nI really wanted to get this one released, hope you all love it!",
