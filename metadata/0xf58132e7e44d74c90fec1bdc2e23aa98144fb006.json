    "description": "Pods are the life-giving vessels of the degenerates, allowing them access to lands undiscovered by the professionals. Heavy and cumbersome, these large devices contain enough personal supplies and weapons to sustain one or two individuals for long periods of time. It is the degenerate's greatest tool for interstellar and interdimensional transportation, allowing them to explore the dark void beyond our planet. Piloting the pods is a fine art, requiring incredible skill and intuition. Each pod has a tiny clock, reminding the degenerates of the ever-scientific cycle of time. Pods are a necessity, a tool of exploration. Though they may go unrecognized by professionals, they remain the lifeblood of the degenerates as they strive to break the boundaries of space and time.",
