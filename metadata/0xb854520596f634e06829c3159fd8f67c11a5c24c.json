    "description": "15 y/o African-American teen artist Mya Parker (USA) and 13 y/o Korean-American teen artist Maya Creates (South Korea) have teamed up to create the inspirational art piece “Create Against the Odds”.\n\nThe fire represents our passion for positive change. The light blue coloring represents the hottest type of fire, showing the depth and commitment of our passion for art and Web3. \n\nOur intention in creating this collaboration artwork is to inspire people who statistically might not succeed to not give up and instead have the courage to continue creating the change they want to see.",
