    "description": "Coya, Queen of the Incas, was the highest ranking female in the Inca Empire, and she held great power and influence. She was responsible for the welfare of her people, and she was revered as a goddess. Coya was a symbol of fertility, beauty, and strength. She was a protector of her people and a force to be reckoned with. \n\nThe Sassy Crayon explores harmony in contrast using traditional fine art processes and digital media manipulation. Combining old and new, vivid and desaturated, light and dark, and fusing the past with the present. \n\nThis artwork was created by combining traditional painting methods with digital manipulation, and is part of a series of contemporary artworks that pay homage to this powerful Inca queen.\n\nHELLO@THESASSYCRAYON.COM for first collector physical, hand embellished copy. \n\nhttps://thesassycrayon.com/nfts/",
