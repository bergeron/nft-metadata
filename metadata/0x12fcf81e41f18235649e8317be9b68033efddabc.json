    "description": "Yesterday, Bucky The Butcher was a rare, limited edition 1 of 60 doll. Today, due to a stray hair from Nerd #2035 and the thermonuclear explosion that tore her house from its foundations, Bucky was alive and he wanted answers that 2035 couldn’t provide.\n\n2035 didn’t know what to think, she was reeling from the shockwave that threw her from the beaten up sofabed, the eye-watering heat and the fact that a once inanimate Bucky The Butcher doll was alive and attacking her.\n\nAfter calming Bucky down, again, 2035 started reflecting on the events of the day before. She couldn’t believe her luck; how did the basement not get destroyed? How was she alive? Were her friends alive? How was Bucky alive? Could they go outside? How was she going to eat? Did Bucky need to eat? Her thoughts flitted from unanswered question to unanswered question.\n\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTgTbxYRXyZqvRzXZK4Q4ZWrNMiTRSQ3sFjcZTaR5oC7X\n\nhttps://www.nuclearnerds.io/lore/53/",
