    "description": "Our own worries and the burden of this city push us away from each other. But there are such landmarks that easily remind us of where we live; a vast and ancient history. A history that we can't see in the midst of chaos and even if we see it, we do not care.\n\nThis photograph is the first example of a photographic project that will continue for several mounts. It's part of an ongoing work that firstly highlights the iconic architectural structures of Istanbul. Galata Tower is one of them.",
