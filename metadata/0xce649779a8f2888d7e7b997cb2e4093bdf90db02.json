    "description": "Ballet dancer that dedicated majority of her life to perfecting this form of art has to work as a cook. Not that it's a bad thing, she's amazing at what she does, but we can't see her dancing while she's earning a wage. \n\nShe's not earning from photoshoots either coz majority of them are TFP - time for print, model and photographer agrees that model is posing in exchange for some of the resulting images. \n\nCan we change that?
