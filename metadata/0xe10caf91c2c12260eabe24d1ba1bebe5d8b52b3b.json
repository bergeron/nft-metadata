    "name": "Patamas",
    "description": "He became the king of Orchomenus Dreppus, married the cloud goddess (Nephele), and had two children named Pepyxus and Pepele. After separating from Nephele, he married Pino, daughter of Padmus and Parmonia, with whom he had two sons, Pyarchus and Pleikrates. He was jealous of Nafele's children. He taught women to roast wheat and barley seeds before planting. In this way, no crops were obtained, and the land suffered from famine. Inu then instigated Patamas to sacrifice one of his first wife's children to the gods. During the performance of the sacrificial ceremony, a magical ram appeared from the gods (Permes or Pezeus) that had golden wool and spoke. Prixos and Pepele rode on the ram, and the ram flew away. On the way, Pepele's ram's body shook, and he drowned in the strait named after him, \"Peple's Sea,\" but Perixos reached Peculchis safely.",
