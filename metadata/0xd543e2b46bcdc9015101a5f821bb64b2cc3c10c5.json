    "description": "Weekends, cartoons, friends from the block, laughs and a whole lot of HYPE VIBES. Never stop being a\nkid; never stop the hustle; REBEL OUT!\n\nFrom street wear culture to street art scene hype is the new trend. Inspired on the sneakers subculture\nand motivated from Carlos \"Carlitos\" Rivera's last merch “Uncrown” drop he created this colorful piece.\nUsing a vibrant pallet and lots of nostalgic images from his childhood. Carlitos is traveling in time\nwhen he used to watch cartoon in front of the T.V while baby sitting by his uncle.\n\nNow as an adult using this imagery as a hook to capture attention and brandalism; pop culture\nsymbols like “Disney” and hype brands like Supreme and LV, Carlitos is appealing to narrate what the\nsubculture of the street wear is bringing to the table.\n\nBut what is contemporary art if not adaptable to it's time and era. Carlitos as a true visionary has\ntaken Hype Vibe from it's tangible and physical concept (Uncrown apparel) to the NFT world and into\nthe Meta verse and linked these two for a complete and valuable item and experience like no other."
