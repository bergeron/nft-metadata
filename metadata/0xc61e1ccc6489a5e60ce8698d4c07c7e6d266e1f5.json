    "description": "Is there a limit to human capacity or is the limit only in our minds?\n\nAny theory represents only one aspect of the manifestation of a multifaceted reality.\n\nThe multivariate nature of our world is its most fundamental characteristic.\n\nPerhaps the world in which you are weak is just one possible scenario for your life. It is up to you to choose your own path. Sometimes you just have to look at things from a different perspective. And then choose a more suitable option where you crack the limits.",
