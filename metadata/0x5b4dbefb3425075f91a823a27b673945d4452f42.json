    "description": "On March 14, 2022, Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk tweeted, “I hereby challenge\nВладимир Путин (Vladimir Putin) to single combat. Stakes are Україна (Ukraine).\n\n\"Do you accept this fight?\" he posted, tagging the official Kremlin account.\n\nMusk got no response from the Kremlin or Putin, but he did get a response from the head of the Russian space agency, Dmitry Rogozin.\n\nRogozin responded to Musk with an excerpt from the short story 'The Story of the Priest and His Worker Balda' by A.S. Pushkin, \"You, little devil, you are still young, compete with me, weakling; it would only be a waste of time. Overtake my brother first”.\n\nTo which Musk responded, \"I see you're a tough negotiator! Ok, you can have 10% more money from the event payout.”\n\nGotta love it.\n\nThis rare (one of one) political parody piece chronicles the “Fight of the Century” that never took place. Musk and Putin are both epic 21st Century figures. The NFT captures and preserves this classic exchange for future generations.",
