    "description": "Warhol’s Dollar signs were a symbol of wealth and success and an icon of their time. However, in his serial reproduction of it, it can be said that he also drained it of it’s symbolic meaning. Here, in Warhol’s Check Marks I attempt to do the same with the Twitter Blue Check Mark. Once a reputable symbol of a person's or organisation's notability it now merely symbolises that the owner can afford @ $8 per month.\n\nCollect a unique piece with artistic provenance @ $8 for a lifetime.\n\nNOTE: Every piece in this collection is unique. There are no copies. None is rarer than an other. There are no rarity rankings. They are each unique.\n\nPlease follow the artist on Twitter @Neeoverse\n\nInspired by VVChecks @visualizevalue @jackbutcher & Andy Warhol.",
