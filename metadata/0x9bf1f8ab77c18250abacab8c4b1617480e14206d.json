    "description": "Nature has myriad of children hidden in Her heart. If you peer into the forest thickets long enough, you may occasionally notice a being beyond your normal experience somewhere in the corner of your eye. Not only they hide behind the trees and under mighty roots, they are themselves a tree, a root, a wire of mycelium connecting the forest as one living organism. Nature is versatile, changing, unbound by the human rules. There is no good or evil, only pure existence. The Green reminds us that Nature is what was before us and will remain after. When we, humans, pass, our footprints will fill with grass, the greens of moss will cover everything we left. The Green warns us to be respectful to the Nature, or feed the greens from underneath with flesh and bones it have given us.\n\nDigital image by traditional artist and sculptor Alisa Tochylovska\n\nShort story \"From words of a young farmer\" about this creature: https://www.instagram.com/p/CE4hRvulRkg/\n",
