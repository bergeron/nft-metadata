    "description": "The abadoned love, the roots, the life. The eternity.\n\n\"His eyes were determined to resist the light and he reckoned everything would go dark in a moment. But no, he was mistaken. Everything turned white as the light scattered in his eyes. How could it be? Clouds descended to the ground, dispersed as they passed through each other and gathered back together in wisps. He smiled as he walked and his decisive footsteps made him believe in an observant order. [...] He saw his wife and son in the rose garden in the village, in Koyucak. There was the magnificent scent of love, of being a family, of being together. That scent had never before embraced him as it was now. He was out of his senses. He knew life from that scent even though months passed. Yet he needed to die, because where he was wasnâ€™t reality.\"\n\nText: excerpt from \"The Abandoned Rose\", by Eylem Tok\nIllustration by Juan Hernaz\nOriginal music by Cylnea",
