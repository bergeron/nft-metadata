    "description": "She stepped out from the battle field, with the great reward from her companion - a beautiful grown of jaw dropping details and decorations.  “This should be sold in a good price!”\nShe arrived the slum, finding herself in storm of desperation and fear.  “WHAT HAPPENED ?! Kalson!” \n“They…broke in! Robbed and killed with no mercy….Danny was killed and many many others are dead now!!!”  The boy bursted into tears as she folded him in her arms, the only thing she could do now. \n “Ms Robin?!”  “Yes, Kalson?”  “Is the Bird your friend? Can he gift us whatever I wanted?”  “It depends.”  “THEN I WANT MY FRIENDS BACK!”  “……sorry, boy. I don’t think he can do that..”“………”\nBut my dear,” holding her poor orphan friend’s little hands,”he can give us strength! Strength to protect ourselves!”  “Then, tell him that I want TO BE STRONG! But I need no protection, I NEED REVENGE!”\nRobin fell into long desperate silence. She knew very well the Phoenix has won. Love left and only hatre and war remains",
