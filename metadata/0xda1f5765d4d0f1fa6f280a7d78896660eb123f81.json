The moment I felt like wanting to be recognized or \"found\" It constantly drew me away from my creative process. \nCountless burnouts have led me here and now I've found a greater meaning in being an artist than just recognition.\n\nSoul searching for me is self reflection, Welcome.\n\n\"Search\"  A self portrait by Taksh Shikari.",
