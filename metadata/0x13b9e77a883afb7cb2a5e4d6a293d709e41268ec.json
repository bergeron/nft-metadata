    "description": "Too many women in too many countries speak the same language of silence. \nBut sometimes I wonder.\nWhen a woman shares her thoughts, as some women do, graciously, it is allowed.\nWhen a woman fights for power, as all women would like to, quietly or loudly, it is questioned.\nAnd yet, there must be freedom — if we are to speak\nAnd yes, there must be power — if we are to be heard.\nAnd when we have both (freedom and power) let us now be understood.\nWe seek only to give words to those who cannot speak.\n\n\n4096x5120 pixel.\n300 dpi\nCreated using stable diffusion, finished by photopea.\n\n",
