    "description": "In my small collection of notebooks, there are various beauties - blank, with lines, squares, rectangles, or dots. I tend to save them for special topics, but mostly use them to scribble, write down notes for lectures and draw shapes for future code sketches among other things. Often there are noticeable repeating patterns in the chaos and I drew inspiration from my personal notes, but also from historical data, feminine shapes, associative colors, calendars, cycles, and with help of code I made imaginary diary logs. In colorful diagrams, history is repeating and events are recurring, shading is changing under the folds of fabrics, and dynamics of social occurrences are nonlinear.\n\nDates on these diary pages are cryptic, in order to make it universal for past and future, not connected to any recognizable part of human history - but making it universal, intentionally provoking a meditative feel.  \n \nClick/tap to turn the next diary page.",
