    "description": "It is always windy here.\nIt penetrates through the bone. Burns the eye and tires you, there are so many seagulls – it s not sand – it s mud left from the winter, a city of the Middle Ages…!\nIf it s the twilight of sunset and you walk at the cemetery, you will be empowered by a strange feeling, as though the air entering your lung is heavy. The odor of ecstasy and camphor fills yiur unconsciousness and weighs on your shoulder, yu keep looking back!\nWatching a suspended piece of bone, right at that moment of absence, where it s not clear if you are coming to this world or going, is what Kolsum  dose. A fascinating entertainment is taking place and the outcome: a festivity accompanied by the smell of decay. \nRotting, towards the inexistence of inexistence, that rein ents existence itself. And inexistence only at a specific instance coincides with existence, and this coincidence, however short, is significant. \nIt is as thiugh time is extended, celebration is on, you no longer know if what",
