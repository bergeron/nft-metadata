    "description": "It is sometimes believed that only rich people who already possess wealth and seek to increase it can suffer from this spiritual disease. However, a person of average income, and a poor person, and a completely beggar - everyone is subject to this passion, since it does not consist in the possession of things, material goods and wealth, but in a painful, irresistible desire to possess them.\n\n(Oil painting on canvas).",
