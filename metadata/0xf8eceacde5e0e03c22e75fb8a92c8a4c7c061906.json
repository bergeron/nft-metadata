    "description": "In my beginning is my end...\n\n\"The Beginning\" was the first piece to be minted to Architect's Musée Imaginaire, an art experiment bringing together memories, experiences, yearnings, a Ph.D. Architect at work, nothing more.\n\n\"The Beginning\" portrays the Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck's house in the Netherlands. For Van Eyck, vision permeates matter, and this house, made and inhabited with this idea of visibility in mind, is formed by strata that is pressed into a single plane of vision, layers that I brought together in this digital collage. It is the lack of visible (optical) depth, with the space constantly interrupted and hidden behind things from different times, what produces its phenomenal transparency. \n\n‘Architecture must reach beyond visibility; places at a great distance should be conceived in terms of each other, since memory, anticipation, emotional and intellectual association transcend the limitations of temporal and spatial distance’",
