    "description": "Enclosed within itself, the human mind is limited in its perception of the world around it. Each of us having our own pattern of perception, we can only see the world through this lens of subjectivity. Praising the differences and expanding the picture by including more ways of seeing into it, we get closer to objectivity, which is forever unattainable.\n\nFollowing the patterns of electricity in a brain, Points of view is a visualization of thinking and interpretation of reality. Everything in the material world exists for humans as a mental image changed by the prism of the mind, leaving its trace as a network of electrical impulses. Travelling from person to person, this energy of connections forms an invisible flow of power moving the world and changing it with ideas and creativity.",
