    "description": "A 5400x14916 PNG rendering of the Solidity code that implements a 0-fee CryptoPhunk market contract at [0xd6c037bE7FA60587e174db7A6710f7635d2971e7](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd6c037bE7FA60587e174db7A6710f7635d2971e7#code).\n\nThis code powers notlarvalabs.com and the revitalization of the Phunk movement, post-OpenSea ban, post-original dev abandonment.\n\nBut you don't need notlarvalabs.com to use itâ€”this code enables zero-fee trading of Phunks from anything that can talk to the contract.\n\nIn fact, you don't even need to trade Phunks with it! The code is MIT-licensed so you can use it to create your own marketplace for any NFT for phree!\n\nA true work of art, available for the first time ever in PNG form. All proceeds will go toward furthering the Phunk movement through technology!\n\nThanks, and Remember to zero the pending refund before sending to prevent re-entrancy attacks.",
