    "description": "NOnes,In Japan, ZEN is the highest state of life. Life is suffering, life is impermanent, less is more, nothing is existence, jump out of the right and wrong, good and evil, benefit and harm, and cause and effect of things, and return to the stage where there is no such relative concept, because the self-nature is pure, as long as you can understand your own heart, that is, It can be enlightened and become a Buddha, without action, without signs, You are me, I am you, anyone can be me, I am anyone",
