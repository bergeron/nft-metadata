    "description": "The creative process is a mystery, often compared to magic. It's something that can't be forced, but only allowed to happen. \nThis is different for every artist. Some artists can sit down and plan out every detail before they even start. Others may start with a general idea and see where it takes them. There is no wrong way to be creative. \nIt's hard to say where inspiration comes from. For some people, it comes from the world around them. They see a beautiful sunset and are inspired to paint. For other artists, their minds are exploding with a million ideas about the next creations, colors and techniques, and they need to let it out, like a volcano. The latter is what I call ‘Mind Eruption’.  \n",
