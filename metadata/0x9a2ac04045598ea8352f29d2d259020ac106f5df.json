    "description": "Experimental Hip-Hop Artists JAYPROB and Rocky Snyda come together to form New York’s new rap sensation FUTRxLGND. The collective is not only compromised of the duo but of extended members of different artistic mediums such as photography, styling, art, etc. throughout their community.\n\nJAYPROB and Rocky Snyda have been making waves in New York’s underground music scene for some time now, focusing mainly on their independent artistry and building a community following. It wasn’t until January 2022 that the “duo” released their first collaborative song “BRONXLYN” and are set to release a joint album 2023.\n\nFUTRxLGND has graced the stages of National Sawdust, Knockdown Center, Elsewhere, Brooklyn Bowl, Everyday Ppl, Afropunk, Vans, 300 Ent. and more. They have also hosted for brands such as Vice, Noisey, Reebok, Symphonic Distro etc. They hope to continue their reign for years to come by taking on different genres along the way. Their latest single “Whistle While You Hurt” features Jay and Rocky flipping an 80s inspired track produced by artist Belaire on its head. Inspired by indecisiveness in love and love in the internet era, they hope to reach new heights with this pop-funk track. ",
