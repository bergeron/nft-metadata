    "description": "Whilst on holiday with my wife in the famous 'Quiet Man' town of Cong in County Mayo, Ireland, I had planned to visit this little fisherman's cottage, which was a 30 minutes drive away in the Connemara Region of County Galway.\n\nIt was a typical summers day on the west coast of Ireland, the rain was bouncing back off the ground at me and of course, as with most of my outings, guess who had forgotten to bring the umbrella.\n\nThis location has an obvious composition that most photographers in Ireland have taken, on this particular morning, I had a good walk around the lake to see if I could find something different.\n\nI came across some rocks and branches in the water, which I thought framed the little cottage nicely.\n\nI waded into the water and set up this shot, 30 seconds exposure at F/16 to smooth out the water & to get a bit of movement in the clouds. If only you could have seen the shape of me taking this photo, I ended up completely drenched.\n\nPhotography can be fun!\n\n\nArtist: Michael McCafferty\n\nCollection: Michael McCafferty Photography 1/1's\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: The primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, displaying privately and in groups, including virtual galleries and documents, as long as the creator is credited.
