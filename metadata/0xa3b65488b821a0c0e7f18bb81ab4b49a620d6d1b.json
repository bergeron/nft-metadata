    "description": "Drawn for ukrainedao.eth\n\nUkraine and Uzbekistan, my homeland, are far apart, but I didn't perceive this country as something foreign. I have many friends and colleagues from there, my relatives live there.\n\nAnd from the moment Russia started the war, I share all the pain and anxiety for Ukraine and its people who have to go through all this.\n\nI believe that Ukraine will be able to cope with all the difficulties on its way, will preserve itself, and people will stop dying.\n\nFebruary 26, 2022",
