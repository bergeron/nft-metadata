    "description": "\"I like your camera!\" she shouted, as I obliviously walked by her. \n\nI had been around the block a few times by this point, and when I approached the woman with a smile, she looked at me, but seemed more focused on the camera as her eyes lit up with curiosity. \n\nHer english was broken, but I could tell she wanted to look at the camera, and I happily obliged. We exchanged a few words as she admired it, and we went on our way.\n\nA smile was on her face for the entirety of the exchange. She went to leave, all the while whistling a tune as she turned a corner.",
