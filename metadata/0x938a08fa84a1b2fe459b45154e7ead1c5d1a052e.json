    "description": "Continuing to build on Dash’s current momentum, “save yourself first” is an energetic take on letting things go to save what’s left. Written as “a musical representation of a train-wreck,” the eagerly anticipated track has been a fan-favorite of hardcore Dash fans for months now. After receiving tens of thousands of views across TikTok snippets and IG Live, the track will serve as the second single on upcoming EP, “Bandolier” — slated for early 2023 release.\n",
