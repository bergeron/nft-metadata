    "description": "The face of a female and that of a male is combined together to form a single object. The artist is inspired by the murals and relics of the ancient Greek and Roman periods. He was fascinated by how the Greeks and Romans combined the facade and the sides of a human face. He tried to combine the traits of female and male characters in a single perspective and consummated the portrait with strong red heart-shaped lips.",
