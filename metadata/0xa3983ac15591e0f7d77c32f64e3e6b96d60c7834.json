    "description": "A walk in the rain in Covent Garden, London. Covent Garden market dates back to 1654. It was the first piazza in London. Today it's a mix of shopping and places to eat. The neo-classical building was designed in 1830. I am always fascinated by the mood rain creates and how it can transform a scene which is what I tried to capture in this painting",
