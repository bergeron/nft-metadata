    "description": "Travel Without Moving #1\nMonteverde Cloud Forest, Costa Rica\n\nTWM is an imaginary travel set in the bold adventures of great explorers of the past, taken from the pages of voyagersâ€™ diaries, accounts of merchants, naturalists or missionaries, and told through my original photographs.\n\n\"We set out, in company with Pedro, for the falls of the Macho, a tremendous cataract leaping full three hundred feet without a break. the indians of Orosi tell you there is an enchanted mule stabled in the bright green basin into which those waters plunge, and that at night, laden with bags of gold and silver, the mule swims to the surface, climbs the huge steep rocks which overbangs the basin, and deposit his burden in some grove or cavern which has not been yet discovered, and, probably, never shall.\"\n\nfeatured on the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2017/02/02/t-magazine/art/federico-ciamei-natural-history-photos/s/2tmag-ciamei-slide-F2YJ.html)\n\nTWM is also a book published by Skinnerboox",
