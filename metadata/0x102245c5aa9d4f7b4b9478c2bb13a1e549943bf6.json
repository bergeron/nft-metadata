    "description": "The cycles of life, they ebb and flow,  \nLike flames that flicker and dance with light,  \nFrom death to birth, they come and go.\n\nThe Phoenix, too, with fiery glow,  \nRises from ashes, a stunning sight,  \nThe cycles of life, they ebb and flow.\n\nIn fire, we see a constant show,  \nOf change and growth, with all its might,  \nFrom death to birth, they come and go.\n\nAnd though we fear the undertow,  \nOf death and loss, a chilling fright,  \nThe cycles of life, they ebb and flow.\n\nBut in each cycle, there's a chance to grow,  \nTo learn and love, to shine so bright,  \nFrom death to birth, they come and go.\n\nSo let us embrace the cycles we know,  \nAnd rise like the Phoenix, to great heights,  \nFor the cycles of life, they ebb and flow,  \nFrom death to birth, they come and go.",
