    "name": "Ancient wooden church in Sedniv",
    "description": "This painting is of an ancient wooden temple � a Cossack church � that has survived many cataclysms associated with the turbulent history of Chernihiv and Ukraine. \n\nThe unique building carries the echoes of the centuries, the spirit of that time, the wisdom and knowledge of our ancestors. Thanks to the architectural monuments that have up to now survived, we can learn about the lifestyle and customs of my people, what they rejoiced at and worried about, what they aspired to and how they lived two-centuries ago. \n\nThe Church was built in the Cossack baroque style in 1747. The wood, darkened after many, many years, gives unique combinations of colour and tone. \n\nWhile painting this particular piece, I felt something mystical, some kind of presence. It was strangely everywhere � in the church, in the surrounding grounds, in the huge oak trees. It felt like someone was watching me as I worked.\n\nSo many times, the clouds thickened so strongly over Sednev that it seemed a rainstorm was inevitable. But it didn�t come. It was almost as if whoever, or whatever was watching over me, dispersed the clouds, giving me the opportunity to continue, and finish the work.\n\nWe are very lucky that so far nothing has happened to this pearl of wooden architecture during the occupation. Perhaps the same forces that helped me continue painting will now help preserve this unique monument of history, culture and architecture for our descendants.",
