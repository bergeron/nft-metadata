    "description": "so different - Cudos (feat. DEEGAN) \nReleasing on DSPs October 27th.\n\nCudos (Dan and Alex) hit me up earlier this summer to work on a song after hearing me on Daniel Allan's \"Overstimulated\". They sent me a beat titled \"Whats The Point?\" and I was instantly in love with not only the sound of the instrumental, but the idea the track. Even if \"what's the point\" was just a place holder name, it spoke volumes, and I was instantly inspired to create a world around that single phrase.\n\nAfter being dumped, there are really only two options that a 'dumpee' can take... but they both unfortunately lead to the same place. \nHere are the two options:\n\n1. Accept your fate and move on.\n2. Change everything about yourself so the 'dumper' loves the \"new version\" of you! (pssst there is no new version, it's impossible.)\n\nOutside of the song itself, personal growth and healthy change are always welcomed, and with the release of \"so different\" Cudos is making a healthy change in their independent music career by transferring over to Web3. \nI love full circle moments. Let's take a look shall we?\n\nDaniel Allan and Cudos collaborate on a song Pre-Music NFTs. -> \n\nDaniel Allan onboards me to Web3 with \"Overstimulated\". -> \n\nCudos hears \"Really Cool\" and wants to make a song with me. -> \n\nI onboard Cudos to Web3 with \"so different\" -> \n\nCudos makes the official remix for \"Cool Water\" on Daniel Allan's second Web3 EP \"Glass House\".\n\nDon't you just love that? \nWelcome to sound.xyz Cudos! So proud of you fellas :)\n\n\nWritten by Cudos, DEEGAN, Natiive\nProduced by Cudos\nCo-Production by DEEGAN & Natiive \nLyrics by DEEGAN\nArtwork by Bella Friedman",
