    "description": "“From the shoreline we would sit and watch the patrol vessels skim across the sky, their whining engines spoiling the peace and serenity. We always came here as the sun was setting to marvel at the beauty of our sister planet. Sometimes it was possible to forget the raging wars in our part of the universe and take a moment to remember the peaceful times.”\n\nI took the original photo whilst out for a walk in my hometown. As soon as I got back, I worked on adding other photo elements to it, to create this scene. I wanted to try and maintain the calmness and beauty of the moment and the way it made me feel. It was important to work on this softly and keep the harsh editing to a minimum. \n\nCreated in Adobe Photoshop May 2022\n",
