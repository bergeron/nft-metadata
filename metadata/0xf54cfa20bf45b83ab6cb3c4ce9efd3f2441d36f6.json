    "description": "The Kumi series is modeled after a character that I created for my recent show at **[Method](https://themethod.art/collections/kunel-gaur)**. The curatorial experiment is inspired by my love for Japanese graphic culture and Anime. Each Kumi is a 1/1 piece of work that borrows from ideas, cultural iconography, collective memory, and/or writing and molds them into the same silhouette of the original character that I created.",
