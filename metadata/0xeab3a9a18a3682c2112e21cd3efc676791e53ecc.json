    "description": "One of the first photos I had taken with my new camera (which I bought with some ETH made from my NFT sales!)  Wild Cat Recon features my longtime feline friend, Orangey Socks, hiding underneath the single pine tree that sits at the edge of the woods. She’s one of the oldest cats and has honestly been through a lot over the last 4-6 years. Despite battling upper respiratory infections, arthritis, getting hit by a car, etc. she’s still trudging along. I’ve been there during each of these rough times, and I would do it over and over again because I love caring for cats like her.",
