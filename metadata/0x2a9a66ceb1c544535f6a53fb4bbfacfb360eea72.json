    "description": "500 WereWolves roaming around the woods of Ethereum. Although their numbers are small, members of their pack can be found in other blockchains. WereWolves can be used by holders to get multichain services for free; such as verification and sales bot. Those who manage to tame a WereWolf in each chain get access to 100% profit share from the services offered by Moonlight Labs.",
