    "description": "The Vort Wrist Box not only helps Drifters keep track of time, but is a modular platform designed to place a variety of tools and aides for quick reference in the field. They are extremely popular in The Fringe due to their dependability. Gear is difficult to replace out in the frontier, but the Vort Wrist Box's copious modules (both OEM and aftermarket) are compatible across all models, making repairs and situational upgrades a breeze.",
