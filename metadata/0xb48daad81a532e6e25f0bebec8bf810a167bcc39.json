    "description": "The Sludge Machine is a unique experiment combining Open Editions/burning mechanics and AI. By collecting two Open Editions, participants have the opportunity to contribute a word to the AI machine, which will alter the appearance of the artwork. Once all words have been collected, the Sludge Machine will produce a new and final artwork that can be claimed through the burning of the Open Editions. The project aims to engage collectors in a collaborative art creation process, giving them the power to shape the outcome of the piece.",
