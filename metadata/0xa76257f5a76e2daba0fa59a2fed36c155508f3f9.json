    "description": "APE is a collection of artworks that explores the relationship between apes and humans. We like to think of ourselves as evolved beings, but the truth is, we're just apes.\n  >>>  \nWe might have bigger brains and opposable thumbs, but we're still animals, governed by instinct and emotion. This art collection explores our primal nature, and how, despite our best efforts, we can't escape our animal selves.\n  >>>  \nThe collection features a variety of apes, each of them individuals with their own styles, their own taste and their own unique personality. The collection as a whole is a reminder of the close connection that humans have with apes, and it highlights the ways in which we are alike, rather than different. In doing so, it challenges us to reconsider our place in the natural world."
