    "description": "In true darkness, all you have to do is focus on the light in yourself. The mind, body and soul have a lot to say. \nAs you go deeper into the ocean, light fades and colours disappear. When darkness surrounds, it is the inner light that illuminates you. Emotions in the heart, thoughts in the mind, energies in the body begin to flow in the ocean of self. \nThis collection, which aims to glow with its spirit, consists of seven photographs. All of them have been shot underwater in the daylight, with one single breath.\n\nModel: Gülşah Çakmak",
