    "name": "Wordsworth's Delight",
    "description": "A small cozy town by the shimmering lake, nestled in between the Alps, under the ethereal moonlight and a blanket of stars, just after a fresh drizzle. Feels like a photoreal rendition of a William Wordsworth poem, doesn't it?\n\nAs an artist who has always been fascinated with mysticism, surrealism and magical realism, my intention is always to evoke a ‘wow’ and to draw in the viewer through atmospheric mysticism, so that it strikes a fanciful chord and makes them want to be in this place. In this case, a cinematically romantic destination.\n\nI shot this in Spiez, a town on the shore of Lake Thun in Switzerland, on my way to Interlaken from Bern. In view are Spiez Town, Spiez Castle, Faulensee Village and Spiez Harbour by the Lake Thun. Spiez was home to several large Bronze and Iron Age settlements dating back to 1500 BCE.",
