    "description": "Nothing Last Forever is a song i made in Denmark. \n\nThere was this man named Mads who stopped by my house in los angeles for a session that was cut short.  He had a black leather jacket and was chainsmoking cigs.  After 10 minutes he said you should come to denmark.  so i booked a flight and stayed at a hotel for a couple weeks and worked with him.  \n\nthis is one of the songs that came from the sessions.  ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤",
