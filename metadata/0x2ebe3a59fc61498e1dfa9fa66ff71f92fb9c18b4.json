What is left when the life we recognise is gone?\n\nSimulation\n\nWhen we’re alone with our thoughts\nWe don’t know what is real\nWe see things that are not\nAnd feel things that we can’t heal\n\nOur minds are like a maze\nWith no exit or escape\nWe wander in a haze\nAnd watch our own shape\n\nSometimes we think we’re dreaming\nBut we can’t wake up or scream\nSometimes we think we’re living\nBut we can’t touch or feel\n\nWe’re trapped in our own heads\nWith no one to guide us\nWe’re lost in our own dread\nWith no one to find us\n\nBut we’re not alone in this\nThere’s always hope and light\nWe can find our bliss\nIf we hold on tight\n\nWe can break the walls\nThat keep us from the truth\nWe can hear the calls\nThat lead us to our youth\n\nWe can dream and live\nAnd touch and feel\nWe can love and give\nAnd heal and heal",
