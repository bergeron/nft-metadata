    "description": "The Sri Theatre Co. journey begins with the play 21st Century Monk. This specific NFT is unique as it was the first poster published by the company during its advertising campaign.  Now it's being minted exactly 8 years and on time since the day of her first performance. This specific mint is also one of our first publicised NFTs.  \n\nWe believe one must never forget their beginnings, and this poster exemplifies our values. \n\nThat said, credit must also go to a lovely lady we at Sri Theatre Co. call ❤️Aunty Malinie❤️.  She unconditionally made available her home for us thespians to rehearse and supplied us with endless cups of tea. \n\nProduced by Sri Theatre Co.  \nWritten by Aslam Marikar\n\n#Original Cast\nBandhuka \nAnaz \nSiddath\nLona\nRuwanthi\nPraveena \nChrishain \nImesha\nDanny\nDushan \nShehan\nAfla\nSonam\n\n#Crew\nAunty Yazmin\nAshwin \nAll the others that chipped in last moment.  \n\n\n[Sri Theate Co.](https://sritheatrecom.wordpress.com) ",
