    "description": "Dreary Immaculate #1 by Eric J. Taubert. when the ocean recedes and the bladderwrack goes limp. marginal way, ogunquit, maine. \n\nEdition: 1 of 1\n\nDreary Immaculate: Eric J. Taubert's Coastal Maine collection is the inaugural NFT collection by Taubert Gallery. Created in 2022, the collection brings together the most evocative coastal Maine-based works by Taubert taken between 2013 and present.\n\n\"The Ogunquit Art Colony exerted meaningful influence on my development as an artist.\n\nFor almost a decade, I lived in the historic Thompson Farmhouse (1750) located just outside of Perkins Cove in Ogunquit, Maine. I'm also a juried member-artist of the Ogunquit Art Association / Barn Gallery - Maine's original artists' group (established in 1928).\n\nMy Ogunquit home stood within earshot of the ceaseless hiss and seethe of surf against the craggy-cliff Marginal Way coastline.\"\n\nÂ© Eric J.
