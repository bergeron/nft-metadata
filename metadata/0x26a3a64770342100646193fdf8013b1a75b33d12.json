    "description": "This is *Alternative* wireframe version of a digital virtual installation piece as an invitation to my upcoming physical solo show, happening at 825 gallery in Los Angeles 2021, and 2022.\n\nThe red color is from the Asian belief of redthread destiny, â€œAn invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet. It may tangle, but will never break.\" Amaurosis installation is an extension of my previous redthread series, which is building an invisible human network by fabricating red thread in a multi-layered structure.\n\nThis new piece, Amaurosis is focused on specifically depicting our current transitional period of global pandemic situation, dark times like our vision of the future are unseen as if we have blinded eyes.\nI built multiple transparent layers from a clear vinyl sheet. It represents invisible stages of quarantine periods. The circles in each layer are brail numbers. I painted the hint of red gradation on the edge, that says the transition is coming and unavoidable.",
