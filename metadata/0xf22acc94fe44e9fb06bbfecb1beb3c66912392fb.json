    "description": "The Lone Tree\n\nAs simple as this image looks, it took quite some work to capture it. This tree caught my eye while driving around in Tuscany. It's simplicity, just standing alone on a lush green hill make it somehow pleasing to the eye. But the light was very harsh when I first spotted it.\n\nPhotography is all about light, and I knew it would be a much better shot if there would be some light and shadow play. I came back another day with some puffy clouds in the sky and simply sat there for about an hour, taking different images with little clouds and shadow play. Sometimes you have to simply wait until the shot presents itself to you.\n\nI eventually got the perfect shot with a little cloud on top of the tree and nice light hitting the hills. ",
