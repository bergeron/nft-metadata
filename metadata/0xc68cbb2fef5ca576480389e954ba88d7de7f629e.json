    "description": "As the legend goes, those most spiritually and visually charged photographic works of my students are bound to escape the threadmill of retouching and elevate the froth of the daydream to bounce into the upper levels of the atmosphere also known as the Ether.\nAnd there, discovered by the Collectors, get rid of the blockchains holding them to pave their ways into the most stunning private collections.\n\nAll the coins go directly to fellow photographers, no middleman. A unique opportunity to show your love and support.\n\nðŸ“¸ Poleteli Anna",
