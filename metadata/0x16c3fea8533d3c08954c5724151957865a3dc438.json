    "description": "I catch your gaze on me and stare even more intently into the toy machine with brilliants.\nIt reflects my inner state: \"Smile! Show yourself and get yours!\"\nThere's a reason I'm standing next to it almost naked. Look at this stylish tattoo on this flawless body! What firm breasts heave with every breath, and platinum long hair beckons to run your playful fingers through it.\nNo, baby, it's too early for you to know my real name.\nYou'd better play grown-up hunter with me. I'll make it worth your while, you know...\nChanel shoes, Prada bag, Tiffany jewelry, sports car keys are nothing to you. Because you have a gold card. And you can see how I want it all. My stupefied gaze gives away all my desires.\nPlaying with each other is so much fun. Even if we'll never be together. Who cares when you have what I want! And you'll have a dazzlingly bright girl!\nEverything today is for just you, but not for free. And you know it, my honey...\n\n1/1 art by Nastya Shein \n3600x4800 \n400dpi",
