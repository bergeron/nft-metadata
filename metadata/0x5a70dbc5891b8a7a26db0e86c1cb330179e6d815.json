    "description": "PAVED\nPt. 4/5 (Answers EP)\n\nThe chorus melody visited me in a dream after I had just woken up from the ache of unrequited love. The connection was etheric and like nothing I had felt before. Conversations were deep, passionate and soul-searching. Every bone in my body wanted to hold on as he began fading away. ‘Paved’ speaks to a broken promise disguised as a fated lesson in discernment.\n\nWritten & produced by ALYSS\n\n\n♅\n\nYou said we could fly to the moon\nPromised we would get there\nNow we're stuck in memories\nCaged by your complexity\nBut the both of us know\n\nWe can't change all the past we paved\nI don't want to run away\nBut I don't see no other way to go\nWe can't change all the past we paved\nI don't want to run away\nBut I don't see no other way to go\nI don't want to run away\nOther way\nI don't want to run away\n\nI told you you were from the stars\nMaybe that was little too far\nWhat if in a parallel universe\nThe telling us don't give it up\nRemember playin’ Dilla songs\nRemember when we stayed up\nConnecting on our chakra storms\nForever, but the both of us know\n\n\nWe can't change all the past we paved\nI don't want to run away\nBut I don't see no other way to go\nWe can't change all the past we paved\nI don't want to run away\nBut I don't see no other way to go\nI don't want to run away\nOther way\nI don't want to run away\n",
