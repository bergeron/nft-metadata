    "description": "This piece is a milestone for me as an artist. It represents a complete rupture of my creative process for physical paintings, and it wouldn't make sense if it were different. Creating digital pieces come from a need to challenge myself to express feelings in a way that would not be possible through physical paintings. Thus, in the artÂ piece 'Disruption Paradise', this new creative process is born with colors, shapes, movements, feelings and compositions that resonate with the abstract spiritual world that manifests in my consciousness.",
