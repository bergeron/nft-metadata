    "description": "LNRZ ON SOUND WK 6\n\nFirst let's point out the obvious... Jon Waltz & Tate Tucker absolutely walked on this beat. Alongside Web3 veteran Jon Waltz, one of our very own LNRZ Freshman, Tate, makes his first debut outside of LNRZ Lookbook Vol. 1.\n\nA note from the artists themselves:\n\n“Safeguard was kinda like a culmination of a lot of my fav records from the 2000’s, tate fit right on the record and felt like the missing puzzle piece and the song feels like a warm blanket in December. Enjoy” - Jon\n\n\"This collab feels years in the making for me, I’ve been rocking with Jon forever and figured we’d cross paths when it made sense. He sent the track beautifully laced already, I really sat with the notion of ‘Safeguarding’…romantically, platonically. It’s rare I can just unfold into a song I wasn’t there to create from bar 1, but this process was seamless. <3” - Tate",
