    "description": "heds is honored to introduce the second artist(s) featured via our hedSOLO drops. Created by electronic music legends and heds OG's oshi and sober rob, \"LAZER BUCK\" is a new experimental bass heavy project from the duo. Their debut original track \"Adrenochrome\" needs no explanation, aside from the shroom fueled \"Fear and Loathing\" inspired studio session that birthed the song and a lot of the projects forthcoming releases.\n\n    \"josh (oshi) and myself made this song and a lot of this new music in a very chaotic but somehow intentional headspace. I think BUCK is very true to our energy as a duo, and I hope alongside the music video yall can get an idea of whats in store for the future...\" \n    \n    - rob",
