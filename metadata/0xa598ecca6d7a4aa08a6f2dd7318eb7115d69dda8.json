    "description": "One day while clicking some pictures of a troop of monkeys i noticed one them had an abnormality on his face -I was concerned but curious to see the injury ,but the monkey ran away in fear .After following him for 10-15 minutes i got a clearer view and began to click photos .Initially he was afraid but after a few moments he tentatively stepped and sat near my feet giving me an opportunity to observe his injuries .While coming back I beckoned the security guard and asked about the specific monkey.He immediately knew what I was talking about and showed me some harrowing photos and mentioned how though normally monkeys fight with dogs for food and territories but how this particular injury was caused by group of humans who had mistreated the monkey .I realized this of being the reason why he had been so scared of me. The damage we humans cause to innocent animals.\n\nDETAILS-\n\nRESOLUTION: 5062x3368\nSIZE: 9.36mb\nFORMAT: JPEG\nCAMERA MODEL: NIKON Z6\nLENS: 200-500MM",
