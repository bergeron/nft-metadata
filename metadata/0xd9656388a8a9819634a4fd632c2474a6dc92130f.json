    "description": "Photo: 5104х3385 рх\n\nAn event that is sure to be written about in history textbooks is the attempts of Russian soldiers to cross the Seversky Donets River in the Kharkov region. The Ukrainian military, thanks to well-coordinated work and modern weaponry, prevented the enemy from moving additional forces across the river to go on the offensive.\n\nDozens of pieces of equipment and hundreds of soldiers of the enemy army were destroyed in late spring 2022. This photograph is proof of the events taking place there. ",
