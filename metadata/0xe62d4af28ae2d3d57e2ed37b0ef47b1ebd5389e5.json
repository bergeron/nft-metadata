    "description": "A piece from the ongoing series, exploring combinations, contradictions, junctions, fusions, blends, and other ways of joining entities. We are used to interpolating colors or numbers, but what about gradient between material things?\nMade with modern multimodal AI methods, with an accent on the internal latent spaces tweaking rather than on fancy text inputs.\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers."
