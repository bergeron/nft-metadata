    "description": "While spending time in Cannes I'm always struck by the feeling of going back in time to the 1960s. Wanting to share that vintage feel with the images I capture while there, I usually shoot on film. While walking along La Croisette I always have the sounds of Peter Sarstedt's \"Where Do You Go To My Lovely\" and envision Slim Aarons riding his bike with cameras around his neck. On this hot June afternoon, a sun worshiper took a break from the rays to cool off with an ice cream cone and a cold drink. The scene set itself in front of me. A single moment captured on my Leica, the light frozen in time on CineStill Film...and now minted on the blockchain. ",
