    "description": "Crab spider with a Fleshfly kill.\n\nThe predator is Misumena vatia, is a species of crab spider. It is called crab spiders because of their unique ability to walk sideways as well as forwards and backwards. It has a complex visual system, with eight eyes, that it rely on for prey capture. It is amazing as it  can ensnare prey which is much larger than them.\n\nThe prey is Sarcophaga bercaea, a species of flies commonly known as flesh flies.\n\nI saw this moment when I was wandering through my garden. Immediately i brought my Macro photography setup and captured this amazing scene. This process of killing a prey by predator is an important part of food chain and thereby stabilizing the ecosystem. \n\nThis macro photograph was captured on Nikon D3300, with Reversing lens technique, handheld, manually focused.\nThis is a single image and no manipulation or stacking is used to create this.\n\nArtist : Abhinand Reghu \nEdition : 1/1",
