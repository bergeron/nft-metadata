    "description": "These “Mindscapes” comprise my genesis NFT series. I seek to explore inner worlds rather than attempt to capture the elusive reality of Nature. These designs translate perfect moments of clarity and stillness into a language made of color. In the blink of a mind's eye, they reflect the exact moments of heightened pleasure, silence, purity, conscious awakening, balance and alignment we all strive for. I conceive of these lands as utopias - a place you dream to live in and can achieve only within the vast expanse of yourself.\n\nFor every oil painting I make, I go through a creative process of designing a preliminary sketch digitally, mapping out the composition and the color scheme, and ultimately landing on a final finished digital piece before a brush ever touches the canvas. Up until now, these pieces have been private and not for sale. With this release, however, you can now own a piece of the intimate process through which I create work.",
