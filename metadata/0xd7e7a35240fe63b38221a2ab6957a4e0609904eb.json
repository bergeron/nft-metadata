    "description": "Crossroads\n\nA collaboration between Anubis3100 and Andres Zighelboim.\n\nVideo,  \n1920x1080,  \n2021,\n\nTwo paths lead to a crossroad.  \nWhat does the future hold?  \nCrypto Art, and friendship foretold!\n\nCrossroads (MTL x Miami) aims to create an artistic crossroads from Montreal to Miami through the friendship of Anubis3100 and Andres Zighelboim. In the early summer of 2021, both artists took dashcam footage of their drives throughout the cities they reside in. These videos were then overlaid and combined to run both videos simultaneously. The resulting video was then fed into touchdesigner. Through the use of feedback filters, noise, and other operators, the video is transformed from simple dashcam footage to an ethereal, colorful, and otherworldly journey. The use of color and the ethereal aesthetic aims to symbolize the creation of this artistic crossroads. 4 videos were then exported through this process, showing the video at different stages of creation and utilization. Another symbol for the developing friendship between Anubis3100 and Andres Zighelboim. The exported videos were combined in a 2x2 grid surround by black boarders. The final symbol of the creation of the crossroads, through placing it within the work itself.\n\n‚ÄúStandin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride‚Äù ìÅè",
