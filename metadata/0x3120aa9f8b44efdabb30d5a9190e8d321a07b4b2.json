    "description": "The Future Proof Vision Prime collection represents Blackness and is especially confrontational due to Wylie's engagement with Artificial Intelligence as a collaborator. Ever aware of AIâ€™s shortcomings in presenting white-centric imagery and perspectives, Wylie Styles intentionally commandeers the program by depositing Blackness into it, introducing tension to override what is usually a white leaning output to Black-focused representation. His collaborative orientation with AI technology rises out of being uninterested in attempting to convince others to see the humanity in Black people, so he instead treats AI as a receptive vessel.",
