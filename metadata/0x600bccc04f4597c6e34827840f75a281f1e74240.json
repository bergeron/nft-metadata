    "description": "The neuno Alpha Drop is comprised of 517 unique neuCard membership NFTs. Minted on the Ethereum Blockchain, each neuCard membership exists as its own ERC-721 token and membership to the neuno platform. There are five luxury materials that make up the cards of the Alpha Drop and each neuCard is one-of-a-kind with different color combinations, logo textures and a serial number engraved along the bottom. Long fur is the most popular. Enter into a world of vibrant colors, magical fields dancing in the wind and playful butterflies with long fur’s origin story. Watch it on neuno’s social channels. neuCards have two tiers – RARE and LEGENDARY. There are 95 LEGENDARY cards, which are chosen at random and have a diamond logo and status acknowledgement. RARE neuCards have a fabric logo and have a special annotation of the owner’s membership status.",
