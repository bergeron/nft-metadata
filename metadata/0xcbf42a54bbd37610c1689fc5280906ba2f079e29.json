    "description": "Panvala and ATX DAO are working to make Austin a city that gives together. Your donation goes to a shared account that we all control together. NFT holders decide which organizations benefit from our donations and how much each organization should receive at the end of the quarter.\n\nWeâ€™ll hold a Snapshot poll in May for you to add your favorite organizations to the list. As we grow each quarter, we want every organization in town to be part of this movement.\n\nShare this with your friends! The more giving we do together, the more money stays flowing in Austin communities.",
