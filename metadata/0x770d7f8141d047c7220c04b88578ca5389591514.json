A journey of love, sacrifice and undying dedication. Proceeds from this auction will go into offsetting part of the cost of his care, a permanent and befitting headstone and General Certificate of Education Examination scholarship for 70 deserving students to memorialize what would have been his posthumous 70th birthday on 3/01/22.",
