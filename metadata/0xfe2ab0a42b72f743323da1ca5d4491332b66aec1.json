    "description": "The photo was shot in Pula, on the seaside of Croatia.  While I was at the beach, I saw this scene of the elderly walking into the sea.\nAs if they were returning to the mothership, from whence they came. \nThis double exposure was not done digitally in post. Instead, it was created at the moment of shooting, inside of the camera. \nThe image used for double exposure is a composite of stitched and taped diapositives I found at the flea market. \nShot with Cannon A1.
