    "description": "This plate questions and reflects the process of the global production of blue and white porcelain through the use of Artificial Intelligence. Throughout history, the visual appearance of blue and white porcelain have variated in style, pattern and material through oversea trading. The way that foreign workshops produced these ceramic works often skipped an understanding of the cultural motifs present on the plates and vases, but instead rushed to a result. This process could be comparable to how AI operates, generating outputs without fully understanding the meanings of the inputs.",
