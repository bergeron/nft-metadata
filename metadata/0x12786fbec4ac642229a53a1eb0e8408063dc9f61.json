    "description": "Author: Natia Bunturi  The light is a solo dance project choreographed and danced by the same dancer.  The project is precious, as it used a historical musical piece in it, Ishkhneli Sisterâ€™s 1949 song, remastered into the new musical form, that way trying to rewrite the history of it. Bringing a new life to a piece and adding a dance form to it, making it a visual dream of a dancer and a choreographer.   The project shows well how to appreciate art creations of the past and carefully use them for modern ideas, keeping the very important and the mainc them of it, and adding a contemporary approach to make it even more complex in a way. The project proves, that it is possible to rework the past into the future while learning the best from it.",
