    "description": "This is an outtake from my Life In Less America (LILA) collection. I don't want to go into details of what happened, but the bear went wild and an ambulance had to be called. \n\nLife In Less America is a post-photography tribute series to Roope Rainisto's iconic Life in West America collection. In producing the work, I imagined myself on a gonzo roadtrip through the American West in 1968, capturing off-kilter moments from my surreal adventures.\n\nLILA is my genesis NFT collection. I intend to continue on my journey as a post-photography documentarian, creating bodies of work that bring viewers along with me on imaginary travels through space and time.",
