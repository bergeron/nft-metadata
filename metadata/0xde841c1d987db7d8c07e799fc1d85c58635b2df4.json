    "description": "\nThis painting is about the hardship of living alone. Like I have been living alone since 6 years, and I have faced so many problems but there is no one who supports me and tells me that everything will be fine. And no one is here to celebrate my achievement whatever I have achieved. So look In the middle figure you can feel that the person is trying to share something but no one wants to listen , because everyone is going through their own problems. So in this case you just need your family. But they are not here with me. And the lines in the background I use it to show the ups and downs. And you can see there is no facial features. I don't paint human features like eyes nose lips etc. because I believe it could be happen with anyone. Because without facial features you can't describe who is the actual person , so in this case everybody can relate to it and connect to it.\n\nNOTE:-\n\nIf anyone going to buy this NFT they will get the original physical canvas painting at their doorstep.",
