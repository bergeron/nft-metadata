    "name": "The Colorful Queen",
    "description": "The Colorful Queen was created by 9 years old cubism/abstract artist Jacob M. It is a 1/1 creation from his imagination. Jacob is known by using many colors and textures in his art. He uses different mediums for his creations. The Colorful Queen shows how we can all show our different colors in our daily lives. Sometimes we get mad, happy, nervous, anxious, excited, but at the end we can all be kings and queens of our own world.",
