    "description": "\"El camino será duro\nno podrás ver nada\nllevaremos la cara tapada.\"\n\n\nFirst collection in collaboration with Najwa Nimri & N4rf.\n\nCapsules of a broken future, with no place to go,\nthe screen is not an encryptable shelter.\n\nIn these four pieces modeled by N4rf, Najwa wanders through scenes of a portable and dystopian micro-landscape — dystopian, because the render dismantles the classic coordinates of visual representation and because the NFT is a new stage of reflection in the computer maelstrom . In her verses Najwa does not give in to the hope of the linear, she persists as a digital Venus resigned not to emerge from cybernetic flows. \n\nT_T\n\nnft.themovement.land\nthemovement.land",
