    "description": "„It was a bright cold day in april, and the clocks were striking thirteen“  This is how the novel „1984“ by George Orwell begins…\n\nThe story of a totalitarian state, control, propaganda, deception, surveillance and crime has become a reality. 1984 is now! The governments lie. The media spread fake news.  Who controls and who are the controlled?  What is real? What is a lie? Doublethink is everywhere. Don't trust the system. Don't believe blindly. Open your eyes and your mind.\n\n",
