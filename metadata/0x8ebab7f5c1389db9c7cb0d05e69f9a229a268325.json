    "description": "The Sendrock Glyph was created in 2012 after a series of mass meditations revealed the structure of this living mandala. Encoded with layers of geometric and archetypal significance, the precise yet abstract form of this image imprints into the mind of the holder allowing for deep connection to the braided energies of the wisdom traditions from and beyond this world. The myriad effects of the Sendrock Glyph became known as the Scion of Life Initiation, an ever unfolding and empowered calling to serve life and walk along ouá¹› highest destiny path.\n-\nThe \"Sendrock Glyph : Origin\" was the original version of the Sendrock Glyph in terms of color combination and utilization. This combination was chosen to induce a sense of calm stillness amidst the intensity of connection that occurs when the central point is held in focus.",
