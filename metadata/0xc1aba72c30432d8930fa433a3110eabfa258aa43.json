    "description": "This fantastic black matter was born in galaxies \nNGC 1569 is a dwarf irregular galaxy in Camelopardalis.  \nNGC 1569 is smaller than the Small Magellanic Cloud, \nbut brighter than the latter or the Large Magellanic \nCloud.  \nNASA's Hubble Space Telescope has imaged one of the most \nactive galaxies in our local neighborhood. NGC 1569, \nsparkles with the light from millions of newly formed \nyoung stars. At the nucleus of the starburst galaxy is \na grouping of three giant star clusters, each containing \nmore than a million stars. The clusters reside in a \nlarge, central cavity. The gas in the cavity has been \nblown out by the multitude of massive, young stars that \nalready exploded as supernovae. NGC 1569 is located 11 \nmillion light-years from Earth in the constellation \nCamelopardalis.",
