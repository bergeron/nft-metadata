    "description": "This is a collection of polaroids that i took during 3/9-3/27 on my travels to LA and SXSW/Mutual Love Fest in Austin, TX. Going forward, this 1147 collection are instant captures of my life as a transgender human and creative being; in the purest, rawest form possible.\n\nThis also starts the vision for my visual art career as I am primarily a music artist. I have always adored analog technology and film photography as a hobby so this is a very transformative moment for me.\nThe people featured in these photos are my friends shawn, bruno, alex, anuva, klara, and mars in their natural elements. I appreciate them for being such inspirations in my life.\n\nshot on Color 600 film. developed in my pocket. scanned from my iphone '23.",
