    "description": "Every street and every person in Istanbul has a different story. I set out at 6 am to both tour and take pictures. I had to travel by ferry to go to the place I had determined. An elderly woman looking out the window while traveling by ferry. She was evident from her tiredness and sadness. I tried to reflect this feeling in my photo.\n\n*At what point did I lose real life?  On which street and in what season?  From here, everything seems so transparent and easy to understand... However, the smell of the sea behind the window reminded me that my eyes were blind... Like all people...\n\nArtist: Furkan Dere\nCamera: Canon 5D Mark III \nYear: 2017\nLocation: Istanbul/Turkey\nEdition: 1/1\nSize: 4500x3000 / 300 DPi\n",
