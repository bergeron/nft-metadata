    "description": "The series of 1/1 art pieces made by Alexey Tsurkanov. \n\nRAITON IKUZO! \n\nThe scholar of the Raiton style martial art. \nRaiton was born in Japan  in a very rich family. His father was one of the governors working in the Emperors castle, his mother was a kabuki actress. \nRaitons childhood was very harsh, because of his pale skin and white hair, many rich kids rejected him. He was very often beaten up so his parents decided to keep him at home. Another reason for this were Raitons eyes.. Raitons eyes were very sensitive to light so sensitive that he couldn't look straight during the sunny days. Sometimes he had to spent his whole day with closed eyes..   \nOne day Raiton decided to go for a walk despite his parents telling him to stay at home. As expected he got in the fight with kids again but that time was different, just when Raiton was going to get punched he opened his eyes and he saw the lines , very bright shiny lines were connected to the hitter's fists. He could predict the punch.",
