    "description": "In essence, we can't observe space just as physical form. Space is not ‘just the space’ we live in, created from matter and substance, light and shadow and its harmony. Space, above all, gives life. Space is a being with multiple dimensions. Living in spaces, we become them. Through the deconstruction of space and digital collage, I achieved desired artistic expression of metaphysical space that permeates loneliness, melancholy, uncertainty and transience. I build my spaces by collaging fragments of my paintings and photographs. In several spaces I place figures from famous works of art and place them in a new contemporary context. These are “Gleaners” by J.F. Millet and “Stone Breakers” by G. Courbet.",
