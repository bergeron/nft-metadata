    "description": "The smoky haze of recent chaos has settled within the Rocky peaks. Fires have been blazing across Western Canada for months. A pandemic has restricted movement and wonder for over a year. Yet here, in this moment, as the distant splash of canoe paddles quietly echoes across the glistening water, everything is perfect. Blissful and bright.\n\nSoundtrack: \"Simplicity is Bliss\" by Rufus du Sol\n\nArtist: Alex Mackenzie\nLocation: Banff National Park, AB, Canada",
