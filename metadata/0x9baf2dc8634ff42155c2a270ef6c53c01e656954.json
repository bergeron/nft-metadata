    "description": "Location: Orchidaceae is part of the Eastern Outlands of the Innerphase of Gön. \nKnown for: pure energy bloom gardens and forests known for enhancing creativity & wisdom. An Eastern border to the Outerphase, it has a history of being highly volatile due to energy raiders and denizens from the Outerphase. The main group of this region are the Koasians, who act as harvesters, gardeners, and guardians of the land and the energy blooms. These blooms are highly valued by the Ästrals, especially the High Ästrals. Due to this and it's location to the Outerphase, the Koasians are one of the few tribes of the Innerphase with a direct link to call upon the Ästrals for help whenever needed.\n\n\nCard #1 of the Universe of Gön\n\nDigital manipulation of the painting \"the Garden of Redolence\" by Ästral Monk. 🙏🌌📿\n",
