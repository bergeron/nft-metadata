    "description": "The main character is named \"HANA-NO-OMOTO-HIME\".\nShe  is pregnant with a child by a man who visits her every night.\nHowever, the identity of the man is unknown.\nOne day, She sewed a ball of thread onto the man's collar with a needle. \n\nThe next morning, she followed the unraveled thread and found a large cave.\nShe calls out to the cave, and the owner of the cave comes out.\nBut it was not the man, but a giant serpent. The serpent had a needle stuck in its throat.\n\nThis is one of the intermarriage tales in Japan.\n\nHow did the princess feel when she saw the man's true identity?\nJoy or sorrow? Fear or anger?\nI was strongly inspired by the sentimentalism and the romanticism of their mutual connection.\nI created the image I drew in my mind in 3DCG.\n\n4093 x 2894 PNG",
