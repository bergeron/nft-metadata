    "description": "The Emotions collection is issued by Corite and is digital merch for US artist Emery Kelly. Emery refers to his music as Some Of My Emotions. These NFT glasses are interpretations of different emotions using the model created by Ph.D Robert Plutchik which organizes emotions in positive and negative and by different levels of intensity. Emotions can even blend together like colours, creating new emotions. \n \n2,000 NFTs have been been generated randomly with different rarity levels. They include a chance to unlock Fan Power tokens on the Corite platform, which in turn will be used to reward users over time. And yes, weâ€™ve added some hidden goodies too. \n \nFor more details and to see if there are unique unlockable extra features for this NFT, go to https://corite.com/emotions/ \n \nTo learn more about the Corite CO project go to https://corite.org and join our socials https://t.me/corite/",
