    "description": "\"While I was at Yas Shopping Mall in Abu Dhabi. I spotted the fine reflection of the ornate glass ceiling on the floor giving it a lovely pattern. I figured it would be nice to have a subject in this composition, so I waited until the couple had passed. It turned to be an amazing combination (Shadows, silhouette and the floor).
