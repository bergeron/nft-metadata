    "description": "Wandering in the dark, terrified and alone, yet something about this place feels familiar, almost as if I had been here many times before. The further I walk, more my body feels, as though darkness has consumed everything & is trying to swallow me.\n\nMy steps get slower, my legs feel heavier, quickly it begins to feel that I am standing still even though I'm moving. My heart heavy, my chest tightens, anxiety sets in & my breathing deepens at pace. I know this feeling, I know this place.\n\nIn the dark, desperate to find my way out, I come to a stop, my legs can take me no further. I can't even feel them anymore, the darkness feels thicker than before.\n\nMy skin turns cold, like stone, darkness consumes me, my final thought - freedom from the dark.\nIn that moment pink light bursts from my body illuminating everything, reflecting from what appears to be my crystal coated skin.\n\nMy mind is my weapon, I am the creator of this world, not its victim, I am infinite energy, I am transcendent. \n",
