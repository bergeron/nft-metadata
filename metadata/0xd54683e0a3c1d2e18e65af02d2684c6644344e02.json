    "description": "Our vulnerable human condition is so fragmented and ridden with anxiety that often we need to reform and return to our center with energetic and purified balance. I create contemplative pieces using the matrix of the human body as a brush. I call them “Body Mandalas.”\n  I turn the dance of light and body movements into archetypal geometries with a mystical sense of oneness.\n\n Resolution: 3,333 x 3,333 px (.MP4)  \n\nYogi artist: Eri\n\nPhotography work & original music by Federico Bianchi",
