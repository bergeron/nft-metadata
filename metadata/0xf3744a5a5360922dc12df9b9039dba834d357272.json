    "description": "It's understandable that you may want to bury your past, especially if it's filled with painful or difficult memories. However, it's important to keep in mind that burying your past doesn't necessarily mean that it goes away or that it won't affect you in some way.  It's important to work through the emotions and experiences that may be associated with your past, in order to find closure and healing. This may involve seeking the help of a therapist or counselor, journaling, or talking to a trusted friend or family member.  Remember that everyone has a past, and it's okay to acknowledge and confront it. It's often through facing our past that we are able to grow and move forward in a positive direction.\n\nCreator\nAdamukarima ",
