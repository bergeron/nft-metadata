    "name": "White Sands After the Storm",
    "description": "During a recent visit to White Sands National Park in New Mexico, an enormous sandstorm blew through the park for most of a day, erasing all footprints and signs of human use. The next morning was an early-rising photographer's paradise of unspoiled, perfect sand dunes and lovely lines. This particular scene caught my eye as the tough foliage of one of the plants living in the dunes cast an architectural shadow over the knife-edge line of the dune. White Sands is an amazing, ephemeral landscape because nothing is the same from day to day, and the dunes move up to 30 feet per year.",
