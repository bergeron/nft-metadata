    "description": "From Phase I of “The Call” project.\n\nThis photographic project is a fiction about Stephen Hawking’s theory on parallel worlds, in which I search for their marks. A visual story inspired by his researches.\n\nStarting from empty scenes, I install my camera as a witness, then use physical lights, torches, flashes, combined to a long exposure process to paint and trace luminous portals (all the lights are real and created in the shots). During these experiences, I bring those portals to life, suddenly appearing, through a practice at the intersection of staging and pure reality, like crossing points to these parallel universes.\n\n_ Edition 1 of 1",
