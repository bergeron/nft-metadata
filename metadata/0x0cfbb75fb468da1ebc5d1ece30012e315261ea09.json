    "description": "This picture was shot in a subway tunnel during a rain storm in the city of Shanghai. The red lightsaber is a reference to the Knights of Ren in Star Wars, who also wielded the Sith saber. \nWe planned to go to this specific tunnel for a long time, but little did we know that there was going to be a typhoon hitting Shanghai. Instead of cancelling this \"mission\", we still went to the location despite the awful weather condition. After climbing over fences and avoiding guards who were patrolling the area, we successfully arrived to this destination. Even though it was challenging to get this photo, the story is what makes the photo unique and special.\nThe reflection of the light on the ground, and the mysteriousness of the surroundings makes it almost feel like a battle scene from Star wars.
