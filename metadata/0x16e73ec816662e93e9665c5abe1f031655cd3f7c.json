    "description": "It is a small miracle that a saguaro survives its first year of life but once it takes root, it becomes one of the most resilient life forms to grace the earth. It will survive over a century of harsh desert conditions growing stronger each year. Just as amazing, however, is the monument that each saguaro leaves after its death. A towering display of strength and beauty.\n\nStill Standing is a single, long exposure photograph edited in Adobe Lightroom.",
