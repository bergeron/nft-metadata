    "description": "Glory Road...\nTrack 17 \nSomething New\n\nJanuary 2022, i ended a 2 & 1/2 year relationship with a woman i adore and love.\n\nJanuary 2022, i also came up with the idea to make a playlist album. \n\nThe idea was to create a playlist album consisting of singles that are released bi-weekly, with music videos, over the course of one full year. Then, at the end of the year period consolidate them in one place for fans to enjoy. I named the project GLORY ROAD. \n\n\"Glory Road\" meant the road i needed to take to get towards artistic freedom. On this road i would have to complete 24 singles, shoot and perform in 24 music videos, consistently promote these bi-weekly releases all over the internet, and let my fans in on a side of me i have yet to share. To me, It's the road to becoming the ultimate artist. It's artist development. I learn more and more about who i am as an artist daily. I have to show up every single day, no matter what. This process is the dream.\n\nIn February 2022, i signed a 3-chapter 24 song \"Glory Road\" deal with Guin Records giving me the ability to execute the playlist album. In March we dropped the first song but by September 2022 we decided to discontinue our partnership for the final chapter.\n\nSomething New is the 2nd song from Chapter 03 of the playlist album Glory Road. I am happy to share with Web3 first. \n\nAn ode to my 2 1/2 year relationship. \n\n",
