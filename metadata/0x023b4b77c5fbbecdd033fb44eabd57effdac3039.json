    "description": "this is me, exploring, experimenting, venturing into (what is for me) uncharted territory. this is me just having fun, e9Art at play …\n\ni don’t pretend to understand anything about AI art generators, i openly admit that i’m ignorant as all hell. so these first few are examples of me uploading some of my digital paintings into ArtBreeder, turning a few dials, twerking a few sliders, making a shit-ton of aesthetic decisions, mysteriously and magically (i.e. confusedly and irritatedly) waving my hands around in the air, downloading the result, adding a few more touches and …\n\nso i don’t know what-the-fuck i’m doing, it’s never stopped me before. all i know for certain is it’s a blast and I’m having the time of my life doing it.\n\nas usual, this is me, just doin’ my own damn (#NFT) thing !\n\ndigital 1/1 artwork by #e9Art … 2500x2500 …\n\n(PS these were fun and all, but the really fucking amazing stuff happens when I discover VQgan … coming up next)",
