    "description": "Glitch With A Pearl Earring\nAnalog glitch art, 2023.\n\n\"Classical Redux\" is a collection of artworks created by Polygon1993 that pushes the boundaries of traditional art by melding iconic paintings from legendary artists like Van Gogh, Magritte, De Vinci, Bacon and more with the captivating aesthetic of analog circuit-bent gear and CRT TVs. This unique fusion of glitch art and classical masterpieces challenges our perception of time-honored works, inviting viewers to explore the interplay between technology, art, and the essence of human expression.\nThe primary objective of \"Classical Redux\" is to reimagine and reinterpret famous paintings through the lens of glitch art and analog circuit-bending techniques. By introducing visual distortions, glitches, and interferences into the original compositions, the project seeks to provoke thought, encourage dialogue, and engage viewers in an immersive experience that blurs the boundaries between traditional and contemporary art forms.\n",
