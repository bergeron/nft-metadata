A necessary action for me and my family's survival, yet a practice that leaves me feeling shallow and parasitic - particularly when done during a project's early stages; the time when support of the project beyond financial returns is critical.\n\nWhile PFP flipping is a natural outcome for this space when PFPs can appreciate in value drastically, I feel that it distorts, perverts, and reduces the artists messages, skill, and dreams in a way that saddens me. For projects led by artists with goals, vision, and heart - it can be a death sentence. To purely pursue profit is understandable, and something my current situation necessitates, it is still unfortunate how the art, technical achievements, and community can be completely forgone in favor of a purely profit-driven mindset.\n\nDo not consider this collection a criticism of the practice, or of those who (alongside me) flip PFP projects for profit; more-so, consider it a public admission of my decisions and how I feel I am personally distorting art in those moments.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nI am a \nP F P A R A S I T E",
