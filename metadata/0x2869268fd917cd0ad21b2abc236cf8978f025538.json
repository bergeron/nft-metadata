    "description": "Once upon a time, Los Angeles was an amazing place and the town I called home. I went there to work in the movies and TV, and I got my wish. I spent 14 years working with incredibly talented writers, directors, actors and studio executives.\n\nThe world just seemed wide open to me and it was so intoxicating, I never wanted it to end. But over time, it did end. Now the city I loved and where I felt most at home is different. And it breaks my heart.\n\nI hope it can find its way again in the years to come. \n\nMixed media pop art digital painting created from 7 separate drawings, paintings, photos and gradients layered onto one high-resolution digital canvas. This is a painting that attempts to marry conflict and competition, filtered to find the harmony and hope I want the final piece to convey.\n\nThis painting is created in 8K resolution and is suitable for large-scale printing on art paper, if desired.",
