    "description": "Growing up in Stamford is like growing up anywhere else. Its the place that made me.\n\tFor those of you who dont know i go by Daniel Ken! im an artist/producer/engineer. \nI grew up in a small community called Springdale in Stamford, CT. \n\tFrom being a train away from New york you learn a few things, like Facts is Facts.\ni guess thats where the inspiration came for my new song Facts Ft. Kevin George (Prod . by Levy Beats)\nSee me and KG been linked up since day 1. Thats Bro for Life. Thats fam & thats a Fact. Being true and being true to the people you love\nthats what im about. This song is just that feeling ya know and im glad to be able to share it with all of you.\n\tI do this to show people you arent alone, that no matter what happened when you where younger, or \nno matter what people may think of you, just stay true to yourself and never give up...
