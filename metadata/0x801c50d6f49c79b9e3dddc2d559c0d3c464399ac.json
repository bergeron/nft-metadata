    "description": "1 of 12  Self-Portrait Series. \n\nThis series represents my artistic Web3 journey throughout 2022.  Each self-portrait reflects my drive to create work that has a positive impact on society. \n\nJanuary's portrait juxtaposes a stationery sculpture with the sounds of a moving Chicago freight train. I like playing with contrast 3D objects in a 2D space. The shapes, although simple, are the building blocks to design.\n",
