    "description": "2+2 = 10 \nYou make up lies, change whole narratives - just so your feelings are the ones that are correct. Your pride won't let you, you you you. \nMucho homage to the tymes you were real for 1 second. \nIt's not that hard to humble yourself. But you love the speed of lies, where it can get you. It's so rushing and adrenaline like that you may be on many places at once and feel like people just nod at you :) :/ wake up",
