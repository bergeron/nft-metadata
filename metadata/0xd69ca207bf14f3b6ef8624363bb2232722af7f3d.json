    "description": "The world as we perceive it in the 21st century, supposedly in Marshall McLuhan’s concept of the global village, in the age of unlimited communication and technology, is being watched full of irony in a strange backlash. While technology and the internet usage are prevalent throughout the world and while some societies live in a world that is prestigious and where human rights are not considered as an issue anymore; at the other end of the world, barbarism, gender inequalities and human rights violations are still on the agenda. And on the other hand, life, travels, new discoveries, experiences, social welfare, self-actualization, standard of living, happiness, excitement, adrenaline, possibility to explore other countries and cultures, or living on another planet in outer space such as Mars.\n\nIllustration & Animation: H.
