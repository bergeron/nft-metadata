    "description": "One of the things I love about painting is the space and atmosphere. That's why I admire painters like romanticism masters and look at them as role models. In all these years that I have been painting, I have wanted to combine space and atmosphere with suspension and create a unique and attractive scenes. To achieve these characteristics,  now I am working on a small set that is done faster with oil paint on canvas or cardboard and is somewhat close to the features I like. ",
