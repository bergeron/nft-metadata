    "description": "Once there was a mythical being known as the Color Serpent, a creature of pure color and magic. It lived in a world beyond our own, where the landscape was constantly shifting and evolving. The Color Serpent would slither through the rainbow-hued terrain, leaving a trail of shimmering scales in its wake. As it moved, it would absorb the hues of its surroundings, taking on new shades and patterns.\n\ndimensions 2880px x 3680px",
