    "description": "The purpose of this collection is to depict the inner thoughts centered on women and the behaviors imposed on them. A combination of the elements of nature with the element of femininity.\n\nClay and woman are both elements of reproduction. Clay gives life and produces  \nAnd the woman gives soul and feeling.  \nTragedy happens when people's souls and feelings are buried under mud.\n\nThroughout history, women have lived under the pressure of imposed thoughts. Thoughts that have torn apart their existence. Today is the time to sew up the wounds to gain women's freedom and life.\n\nSo today, I am re-stitching the parts of my body that were torn by your hand and looking to the future with hope.  \n",
