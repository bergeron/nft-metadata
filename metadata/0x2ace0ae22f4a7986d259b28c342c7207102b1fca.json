    "description": "Nebula is the Goddess of the dead souls and fertility among the natives living at the mouth of the Tantakun River. Burning the dead, relatives ask that with their ashes and smoke the souls will ascends for that Nebula breathes it into herself. Aborigines believe that the souls absorbed by Goddess are sure to return to the family after a generation. If the birth was interrupted, it was believed that Nebula could not be born, and a curse was put on the family, which would entail inevitable death. As a rule, elders who lived out their days without children were sent to the river and drowned so that the curse would not spread to other families.\n\nOwner will recieve an original artwork and music\n2234*1500\n30FPS",
