    "description": "the way I feel about this piece of artwork is so deep, as if it hits my soul. “I feel like it captures the inner beauty of black girls” said my friend Noelle and I completely agree. black woman are often judged so harshly by our outer appearance from everyone, even ourselves. we need to spend more of that time noticing the beauty within ourselves because that is what makes us blossoms.
