    "description": "Once, she was just a simple blue blobby slime, content to slide and ooze her way through the dark caverns she had always called home. But, as she grew and evolved, a new desire stirred and coalesced within her: the desire to be human girl. She heard tantalizing tales of their world above — of the beauty of the sun and the softness of grass beneath their feet. Each day, she yearned more to experience it all.\n \nBut, to become human, she knew she must first acquire the necessary… parts. So she began to use her cuteness and charm to coax unsuspecting travelers into her caverns, where she could harvest the parts she needed. Her collection grew: a human heart here, a pair of leg bones there.\n \nStill, she was not yet complete. So she waits patiently, continuing to add to her collection, determined that one day, she will have everything she needs to ascend.",
