    "description": "I wrote this song for my girlfriend back when she wasnt too sure if she wanted to be mine. Its funny because the reason she wasnt sold was because she thought I wasnt ready for it. \n \n\nThis song was just a reminder, letting her know how devoted I actually am and how ready I actually was.\n\nThis one is for all of you who have been supporting me so far... it means the world!",
