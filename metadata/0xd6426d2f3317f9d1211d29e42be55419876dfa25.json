    "description": "\"Look Fast\" is the intro track to my latest EP \"Always Less\", released Oct. 7 via Friends of Friends. \n\nThe EP represents my getting back into the swing of things amidst a creative identity crisis. Throughout the entire process, I was fighting the impulses that had been cultivated over the last few years which pulled me away from music. \n\n\"Look Fast\" is exciting to me because I found a way to develop the sound I've established while keeping it cohesive with my other music.
