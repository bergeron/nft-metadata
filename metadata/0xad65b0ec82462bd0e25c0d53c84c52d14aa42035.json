    "description": "One of the earliest attempts to impart some form of order on the universe around us were the constellations. Those representations are probably the first maps that the humans developed, a way used to track the time and also the space. About tangerines and avocados is a photographic series that draws a constellation using the domestic sphere as space; a visualization of the tension that exists between a mixed nationality couple with colonial background. A map that allows various interpretations but at the same time helps giving a sense of orientation in this universe influenced by the barriers of different nature -physical, institutional, political, emotional, cultural and social- to which they have to face. A transformation of the domestic space into a nation, a scenario that reveals the emotional dimension of the constant need to demonstrate the veracity of their love.\n\n",
