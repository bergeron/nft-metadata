    "name": "The Horn of a Taurus Woman",
    "description": "You hear that sound? You hear it in your heart?\n\nIt’s not something to hear with your years, but to feel physically somewhere in your chest. That call at the subtle level… not noisy but warm, soft and persistent like a tender song.\n\nIt’s a horn of a Taurus woman, a caring and protective song, a call of the Earth as a Mother of everything itself.\n\nI know that you hear it sometimes even if you don’t really understand what it is and why you feel it.\n\nNo matter where you are, no matter if you remember me or not, the sound of this Horn - the song of my heart will be always reaching you and gently protecting you from all kinds of evil around.\nMy Horn always calls for you.",
