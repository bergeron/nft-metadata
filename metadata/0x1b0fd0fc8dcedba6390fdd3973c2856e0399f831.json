    "description": "NULLKAMOTO is an homage to both Matt Kane's NOTKAMOTO and the original Rare Pepe NAKAMOTO cards. The piece at once connects and reinterprets the two by boiling down the images to bitmaps, extracting the most bare bone elements, the pixels, of image-processing and graphical techniques.\n\nA custom tool was developed to resample and transform the images into a format native to digital visual representation: ASCII art; here, specifically in the \"Block\" or \"High ASCII\" style, using only 6 unique types of characters: \"█ ▓ ▒ ░ | .\" As opposed to utilizing colors and patterns like Matt did, I have instead reduced the image to the reinterpretation of brightness value and emphasized the blending between past and present cards.\n\n[High-Res Animation (.mp4)](https://arweave.net/lwOBVcSz8jVBz_vqvdVnkKGiBT2w15vhWJMasXXN2eg)  \n[High-Res GIF](https://arweave.net/6zY3jIcOGy9bFmIXnUen9VFbCWB_GjVQ8LFOipFdyHc)  \n[Low-Res GIF (<15 mb)](https://arweave.net/oLA4xI2IkWussdjoo7BVrgSQOiChWkhebLkFqpESf5Y)",
