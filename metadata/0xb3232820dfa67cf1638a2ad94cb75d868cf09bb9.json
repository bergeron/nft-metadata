I walked away with 30 staples in my head and a new outlook on life. This is where my art journey began, where I realized I had a light and a story to share with the world. I was reborn, from the ashes of the Phoenix.\n\nMuch like this experience this place has been reborn from the ashes of the Phoenix, being minted once before and burned. It is time to come alive once again. It is time to tell the story that will be told for generations. It is time to let it all go. It is time.\n\nNeeko",
