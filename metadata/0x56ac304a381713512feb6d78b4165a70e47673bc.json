    "description": "300 years after the worldwide apocalypse of the Gaudern virus. On the planet, many cities have gone under water, and the rest are captured by constant storms and poisonous fog. People in small groups survive in specially equipped bunkers underground, and occasionally, when the rains disperse the fog, they get out to the surface to get the remaining supplies.",
