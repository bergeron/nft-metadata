    "description": "The start of a very long and bone-chilling evening. \nAs dusk settles you know itâ€™s going to be a great night for shooting the night sky, your tools ready, a clear sky, some really interesting things were about to happen in the atmosphere on this night.\n\nI shot the village at blue hour after the sun had set, as a panorama, then as it got darker I imaged the Milky Way rising using an equatorial tracking mount, I was delighted to see streaks of red on the back of the camera, streaks of atmospheric airglow!\n\nThe winner of this auction can claim an epic quality ready to hang HD print, 24 inches on the long edge.\n\nAbout me:\nI'm Paul Wilson, an Astrophotographer from New Zealand. Self-taught and constantly pushing the limitless creative potential of photography, always in search of the next shot. I'm happy to have made so many friends through photography, won awards, and worked with amazing companies.",
