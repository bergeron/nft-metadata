How slight,  \nhow hollow their bodies when I lift them\n\nfrom the shade of the porch, where  \nlike sleight of hand she's pulled them\n\nfrom the morning: blue, brown. A cardinal,  \nonce. A goldfinch. Once, a huddled puff\n\nof feathers still breathing, that I cupped  \nin my hands and carried out to the wild edge\n\nof the yard where the forest waits, unsure  \nwhat else I could do. I still wonder about it,\n\nthat a life should weigh so little. There are so  \nmany ways of being alive. And I'm ashamed\n\nto say the bright ones make me sadder,  \nwhen it happens, when I find them left out back\n\nlike the trinkets my son once dropped anywhere  \njust to keep them near. Their bodies all feathers\n\nand light, until they aren'tâ€”vessels  \nfor the suspension of disbelief, like ladies\n\nsawn apart or levitated in a magic show,  \ntheir audience caught in the longing\n\nto know the illusion, to know  \na secret that forgives itself for being kept.",
