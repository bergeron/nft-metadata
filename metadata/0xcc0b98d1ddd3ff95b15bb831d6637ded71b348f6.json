    "description": "Life in the city is complicated by chaos. Structures loom and cast deep shadows, advertisements scream for attention and the noise of constant motion is omnipresent. Glass offers me a refuge from the nonstop noise and I have learned to find balance in the reflected pandemonium. \nWithin these images are the past and the future locked into the present. \n\nSingle shot that resembles a montage, taken in Warsaw. \n\nTitle: Montage\nEdition: 1/1\nCollection: City - Fascinating Disarray\nArtist: ERIK WITSOE\nDimensions: 4586 x 3057\nLocation: Warsaw, Poland\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
