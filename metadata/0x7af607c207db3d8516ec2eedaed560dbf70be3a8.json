    "description": "Let me take you back...\n\nWhen I was just a youngin', we had a bookshelf in the family lounge.\n\nOn the bookshelf, was a full set of Collier's Encyclopedias, some dictionaries, and an assortment of novels. The books were mostly well-read, but all were kept in a relatively pristine condition.\n\nSurely some of my father's most prized possessions... were his books.\n\nEach day at school, I would learn how to SPELL a new word. Later that day, I would attempt to impress my father by SPELLING the said word. After hearing me SPELL IT OUT, he would usually ask, \"And what does it mean?\"\n\nTo which I might reply, \"I don't know, what DOES it mean?\"\n\nHis response to this type of lazy tactic never wavered... it would always be... \"Well, if you want to know what it means, you'd better look it up for yourself, in the dictionary\" - with a knowing look - and an expectation that I would look it up and return back to him for confirmation.\n\nFast forward 20 years, and the internet has brought about a whole new type of library. My love for words has never been stronger, I'm doing my own research, and I'm being SPELL-CHECKED by a community of loving, hip-hopping, frogs.\n\nI'm thankful for my father - for the philosophical attitude he instilled in me, and my siblings. This philosophical attitude continues to serve me well today, as I navigate through new languages, new words, new worlds, and new people, on a daily basis.\n\nA library is a place where intelligence comes together, in the form of freely available information, in order to create a communal resource that enables all who dare venture into it, to grow.\n\n\n'The Library' is a reflection of my etymological journey into the arts.\n\n\nPictured: https://www.newportbeachlibrary.org/\n\n\nTL;DR - DYOR, nobody else can do it for you.\n\n\nC (See) Lawrie",
