    "description": "Inspired by the song \"Baraye\" meaning \"for/because of\", written by Shervin Hajipour (in Farsi) which has become the anthem of Iran's 2022 revolution. \nAfter the death of Mahsa Amini and the start of the protests, an Internet meme was spread through social media by which (through phrases starting with the word \"for\") Iranians explained their personal reasons for protesting and wishing for regime change in Iran.\n\n\"for dancing in the street  \nfor the fear of kissing  \nfor your sister, my sister, and ours  \nfor the changing of rotten minds and rotten powers  \nfor all the shame of being poor  \nfor all the yearning for something more  \nfor all the kids searching for their dreams  \nfor the lose-lose economy  \nfor all the poisoned air that we have to breathe  \nfor Valiasr Avenue's dying trees  \nfor all the Pirouz that may go extinct  \nfor all the dogs outlawed out in the streets  \nfor all the tears we cry and the endless grief  \nfor all the images that we can't unsee  \nfor a smile, for a smiling face  \nfor all the students, for a future that we can't replace  \nfor all the forced ideas of paradise  \nfor all the great ideas that will never rise  \nfor all the children that won't be saved  \nfor all the \"for all the's\" that won't be said  \nfor all the endless empty promises  \nfor all the falling of cheap houses  \nfor the feeling of a peaceful life  \nfor the Sun after a long dark night  \nfor all the pills we take cause we just can't sleep  \nfor man, country, rebuilding  \nfor all the girls that wish they could be man  \nfor Woman, Life, Freedom\"",
