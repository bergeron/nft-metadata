    "description": "Kotahi, meaning one, alone... this wave alone, sits shining in the low lying sun, the headland lies in shadow in the background. The patterns I chose in this piece are flowing like the sea and include the mighty hammerhead shark, whales teeth and scales, encompassing the tenacity, strength and journey of this wave, and the tenacity, strength and journey of the owner. \n\nI thank you for taking the time to look at my first piece into my world as I journey to my roots through a lens and a pen. \n\nNgƒÅ mihi nui. Thank you. ",
