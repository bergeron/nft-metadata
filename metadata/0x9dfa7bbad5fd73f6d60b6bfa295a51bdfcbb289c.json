    "description": "On the morning of May 19th, 2022 near Northwood, Iowa, a severe warned thunderstorm approached. As it developed, a vivid blue hue eminated from the developing base underneath a whales-mouth-like cloud deck. Once this rising air condensed into this dark contrasty base, the leading edge under the thunderstorm began to create waves ahead of this blue hue. Were told in science that air behaves like water, and before me I beheld an atmospheric wave. Turblent and full of color, just like real waves.",
