    "description": "My Struggle combines handmade digital works of two individual portraits of a married couple, and then reconstructs it into a singular image by an algorithm.\n\nIn doing so, it forms a digital (literal) union between the couple and is a response to traditional wedding photographs.Â \n\nThe work is an exploration in the notions of beauty and questions the symbolic functions of wedding photographs.\n\n'Light' is one of three works in this collection.",
