    "name": "Shannon, Crystal Palace Park",
    "description": "I met Shannon while she was hanging out with a group of friends in Crystal Palace Park one day. I was drawn to her pink hair and laid back demeanour. \n\nDuring the third lockdown, starved of social interaction and photography work, I began taking my camera with me on walks and started capturing portraits of people I met in Crystal Palace Park, South London.  \n\nWith my trusty 35mm ﬁlm camera in hand, I’d walk around the park taking joy in watching people learning how to skate, walking their dogs and spending time with friends. I reminisced on visiting the dinosaurs as a little girl, and discovered parts of the park I never knew existed. \n\nAt times during lockdown, it was difficult to remember that the ﬂat I lived in was not the whole world. Coming to the park showed me that there was an entire universe out there, and that I was not alone. Talking to people while I photographed them reminded me of the most simple pleasure: human connection. ",
