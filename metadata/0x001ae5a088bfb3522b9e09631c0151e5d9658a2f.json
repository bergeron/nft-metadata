    "description": "This portrait is a one of a kind unique work by Apes4Good: conceived and developed to transparently give 100% of sales to charity, and dedicated to 15 inspirations in the NFT and blockchain community. Paris Hilton is an icon: a podcast host, DJ, TV star, artist, activist, philanthropist - the list goes on. Her entry into the world of crypto and NFTs opened the doors for many women to feel welcome as creators with their own voices in the space. She has been a champion of art on the blockchain, known for her Munchkin NFT and the feminine and ethereal collection created with Blake Kathryn; her collections are a breath of (pink, softly sweet) fresh air. Known for supporting charities through the sale of her work, we celebrate and appreciate Paris Hilton with our portrait inspired by her signature style and art. Apes4Good is not affiliated with any other person, company or project, we just love and are inspired by the creativity + joy all of the apes have brought to the world. Spread positivity, love + giving back!",
