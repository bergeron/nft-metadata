    "description": "Eli Schenkel scores the winning touch in the round of 64 at the 2019 Budapest World Championships to qualify for his first Olympics. The Canadian Olympic federation later printed this photo out and hung it on the wall of their national training center without my involvement or consent. In the past, I have worked for Nike and Red Bull as a photographer for fencing. Now I work for the community.\n\nThis is the first photograph I am minting as an NFT.  Artist proof holders will get full access to the ecosystem, including five 1/1s from the 2022 World Fencing Championships. The genesis collection will follow the artist's proofs.",
