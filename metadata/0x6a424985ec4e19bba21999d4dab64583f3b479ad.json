    "description": "In March 2022 we had the pleasure of revisiting the Lofoten Islands. On this particular day I've attempted to take a drone shot of the town of Henningsv√¶r knowing that some rainy clouds are already rolling in over the fjord. While the drone did get quite wet, it also managed to capture this incredible rainbow right above the buildings. Quite the moment!\n\n[Simon Migaj studio](https://simonmigaj.com)",
