    "description": "The very first completed digital artwork, created in 2004 by Mayo and minted as the artist's first NFT. \n\nAll original photos in the artwork were taken by a 3.0 megapixel digital camera, this was considered a fairly good resolution at the time. The artwork follows a late 90's, early 2000's photo collage style, incorporating typography.\n\nThe artwork was created on February 28, 2004 in Photoshop, exactly 18 years before it was minted as an NFT.",
