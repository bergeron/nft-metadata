Does the water in springs taste good?\nIs anyone waiting for us in the cold?\n\nAre there elements still wearing muzzles?\nAnd Dzhankoy does not know the sea.\nDoes the same hand pour the abomination\nat the table on your demand?\n\nI would like to go there by train.\nYou and I, and the off-season’s here.\nSo that the beach is cold and mere.\nSo that the sea’s there only for you and me.\n",
