    "description": "DGENMON Evolution is a collection of 8787 Strong Fire, Water, Ice, Electricity & Grass Dgen Monsters. During the long fight against the bears, Dgenmon had to make a tactical retreat to different parts of the world. While doing so, they discovered some interesting Earth elements. Fire. Water. Electricity. Grass. Ice. Out of curiosity, they consumed these elements and to their surprise, each of them began evolving into a new form. They felt stronger and suddenly new powers that they never had before began to emerge.",
