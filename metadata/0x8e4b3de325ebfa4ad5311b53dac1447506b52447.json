    "description": "growing up in the woods, I spent many an hour alone with the trees. watching the branches sway in the wind, fascinated by the changing patterns of light in the negative space between the trees and the sky. worlds within worlds within worlds exit in the forest, and this has always been an influence for me that has only gotten stronger as I aged and moved to the city.\n\nThis artwork - a digital painting - is a reflection of my early childhood experience as well as an exploration of the interplay between positive and negative space and of 2D and 3D design.  \n\nThis work was initially started in 2011, and then left unfinished for 11 years, finished in 2022.",
