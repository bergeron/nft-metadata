    "description": "Shamyreen Towlagh is Manx Gaelic for ‘Manifold’.\n\nThe mind is a labyrinthine realm. It is it’s own unending space-time, folded in upon itself; and folded inward again and again. \n\nWe wander its living surfaces. We explore our deepest selves. What will we find here? What secrets? What power?\n\nArtist: Matt Brown",
