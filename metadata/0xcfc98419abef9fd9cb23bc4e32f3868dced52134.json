    "description": "The \"observer\" is inside each person. This is the part of consciousness that always observes what is happening, that is present and witnesses everything that happens to the \"participant\". Through the prism of his perception - a mirror - the \"observer\" looks at what is happening and deciphers the moments of his being as a series of thoughts and emotions that he has created himself. And at the same time, the \"observer\" is in an infinite fractal structure filled with life itself in its various manifestations: infinity sees the \"observer\" and observes him. \nBut the \"observer's\" gaze is simultaneously directed inward and outward. It is a single eye that creates reality as it is, a consciousness that creates the universe through the experience of itself, looking through every particle of space.\nThis picture is a metaphor that describes the incredible fabric of space, inseparable and connected together.",
