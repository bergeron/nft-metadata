    "description": "According to the WHO restricting access to abortions doesn't reduce the number of abortions. \n\nHowever, it affects whether they are safe and dignified. The proportion of unsafe abortions are significantly higher in countries with restrictive laws than in countries with less restrictive laws.\n\nData from the CDC Abortion Surveillance dataset suggests that while overall number of **reported** abortions decreased from 2010-2019, those seeking abortions out of state increased.\n\nThese trends are likely to increase should abortion access decrease, leading to undue burden for people seeking the procedure.\n\nThis piece was inspired by several things:\n1) Barbara Krugar's iconic poster which was created in response to anti-abortion laws that were undermining Roe v. Wade for a pro-choice march in 1989 &\n2) ode to birth control packaging design\n\nProceeds to PPFA\nResearch & references can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-zvSGiS-BAgA5oidlXB0hxYo5NvVcqWtPpnouEchK1o/edit?usp=sharing)",
