    "description": "I created this piece as a pastiche to many of the high-value, super simple artworks popular on NFT platforms. A rebellion against fine art and hard work maybe!! \n\nIt's a purposely inaccurate portrayal of the human body. In essence, a gross misjudgment of form.  \"What are you talking about Steve\" I've heard many times, \"It's just a chicken with a mohawk\"\n\n‘FVCK Censorship’ is a new memes collection, taking a light hearted view of censorship among nude artists on social media platforms. The update to this piece, covering the subject's modesty, illustrates the absurd corporate thinking over implied nudity. #freethenipple",
