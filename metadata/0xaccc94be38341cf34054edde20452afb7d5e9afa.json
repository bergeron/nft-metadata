    "description": "Similar to 'Inner Child', 'Unwritten Scripts' is a curated generative art project taking inspiration from traditional art tools such as crayons and ink-pens. The artwork is presented on either a canvas of square grids or horizontal lines; reminiscent of old school exercise books. \n\nConcept: In front of you are scrolls once used to preserve history. They contained tales and images of a land and people unknown. To preserve these secrets, they have encrypted themselves over time, only to be understood by the bearer of the artwork.\n\nMade with p5js. 2022",
