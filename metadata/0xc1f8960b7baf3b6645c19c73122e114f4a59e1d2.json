    "description": "THE IMAGE \n\n \"Complex\" by Downs & Towns - Houston Vandergriff \n\nThis series will contain everything I, as a man, know and understand about women. It can be a guide, if you will, to women. \n\nSo far, it contains just one image.\n\nFocused, distracted, beautiful, distorted, staring into your soul, yet looking elsewhere. This is a single image shot; only edited to black & white. No composites or Photoshop. \n\nThe one thing I have learned from having two sisters is that women are complex. Go figure.\n\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHER \n\nAdvocate. Artist. Traveler. Dreamer. \n\nHouston Vandergriff is a globe-trotting travel photographer based in Knoxville, Tennessee.
