    "description": "In life we face many challenges. We have to make decisions which are often made under pressure from the outside world. \nRight now i'm exactly at this point where i have to make decisions which will impact my every day life. Coming along with those paths we choose we should never forget to listen to ourselfs - free from the outside pressure. \nBut sometimes we don't even know who we are, what we want, what we expect of life.\n\nWe have to find ourselfs.\n\n\n",
