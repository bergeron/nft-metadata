    "description": "1000px 1000px\nNovember 2021 / Santurce, Puerto Rico\nNatural citrine, one of the most sought after crystals, carries the power to tap into abundance,\ncreativity, and joy. It's sunny yellow color brings confidence to whoever keeps it close and it\nmoves your Solar Plexus... the energy point within you that can bring forth to life anything you\ndesire.\nHow? Crystals are formed of atoms and minerals arranged in a perfect symmetric lattice which\ngives each one of them a specific power and allows them to influence the energy of whoever\nhas them close.\nMy hope with this collection is that it lights up the dreams you have forgotten and that it's energy\ninfluences your space, both physical and mental, just like a traditional crystal would.\nSo stare at it, meditate with it, charge it, program it... you'll be surprised at what your intention\ncan do. Allow it to bring abundance and joy into your life. After all, everything, including the\nMetaverse is made of pure energy.\nWhy not harness it in your favor? Dare to elevate your vibration and shift your life.\n*Citrino is part of a 22 piece collection of powerful crystal NFTs that will be released in January\n2022.",
