    "description": "Artist: Jonas Hornehoj\n4996 x 6245\n\nThe karst limestone formations of ‘Palawan’, truly are another magnitude. To the point, in fact, where it was the beauty of the landscapes there that pushed me over the edge in first setting out to work on my art full time. The leap of faith started with a one way ticket to Palawan, the Philippines.\n\nOctober 2017 marked the first time visiting the Philippines. Since then I have returned on 6 separate occasions, to explore some of the more than 7500 islands in the archipelago. However I often found myself feeling a need to return to certain areas.\n\nPalawan was the first place where I dedicated countless hours to improving my abilities as an aerial photographer. Despite my love for experiencing new places, there is an equal part of me that loves to return to a destination with scenes that make me feel inspired, to challenge myself in capturing them with a higher level of artistic intellect, aiming to utilize all natural surroundings in my images.",
