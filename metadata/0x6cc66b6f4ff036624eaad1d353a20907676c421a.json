    "description": "\"Speaking My Truth\"  is an unapologetic poetic visual by Aya, Sakinah Abdullah, and Sharon Messina. They collaborated to create a visual representation inspired by Ayaâ€™s raw poem about coming out of the closet. She wrote the poem the day she came out to her family and her social media community. The poem felt liberating like a fresh breath of air. It was incredibly satisfying to see the process of bringing this poem to life in a visual form. Sakinah captured the moment with gentle stills shot on a Sony Alpha A6000 while Sharon design the typography with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.\n\nCopyright 2019. All rights reserved.",
