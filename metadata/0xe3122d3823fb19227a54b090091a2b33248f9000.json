    "description": "An albino shapeshifter!\nHe's a devine spirit with both human and animal forms. The crown prince of an ancient dynasty which is long gone. He has memorised most of the ancient poems that no one can find in any records anymore. One should be so lucky to accidently find him in the deep of the forest. People consider him more of a myth than a real historical figure. In folk tales he's called Heavenly Bird.",
