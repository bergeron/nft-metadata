    "description": "It was the peak of Oregon Summer and I was finishing up a 9-month road trip of North America in my van. My van had zero luxuries, no fridge, a/c, or area I could work from. My sheets hadn’t been washed in months and I felt like I had a 2-inch vanlife crust all over me. \n\nThat day I was getting back to emails and pitching clients to fund my next trip. It was extremely hot and I was covered in gritty sweat. I felt disgusting. I figured there was no better reason to close the laptop than a sunset shoot at Cannon Beach. \n\nThe moment I picked up my camera and stepped onto the sand, my focus switched from everyday worries to watching the waves roll in; I reset. That anxiety switch was flicked off. I walked up the beach studying the wave patterns and trying to find leading lines to Haystack Rock. I’d fired over 300 frames before this one lined up. By that stage the sun shining through the haze created some spectacular light. I still remember the stoke.\n",
