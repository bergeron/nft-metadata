    "description": "There are **wisdom** and steadfastness in azure eyes. \nShe conquered passions, **tamed** them \nand breathed new life into her lands.  \nWorthy of the savior's mission. \nFor she left the darkness \nand loved the **light**. \n \nNothing is accidental. \nHow this image turned out... I bought new fabrics for my workshop, and when I combined read and sky blue together, I saw the image of a dark-haired girl with blue eyes. \nA model named Olga was found for my idea. The details of the image were picked up during the shooting. So, there was a hoop on his head, as something close to the sacred. \nWhen I saw the final result, for some reason I recall Olga the Grand Duchess of Kiev. Who went through a dark path of cruel revenge for her beloved Igor, and then, decided to convert to Christianity as the **first** of the rulers of Kievan Rus. Now i saw that she was often depicted in a combination of red and blue colors. \nAn interesting coincidence. But **maybe** it's not accidental?..\n\nMarch 22, 2020",
