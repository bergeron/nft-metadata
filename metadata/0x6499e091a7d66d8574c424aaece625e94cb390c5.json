    "description": "A morning hike to reach a beautiful lake in the middle of the Dolomiti, the lake Sorapis.\nIt was still dark when I put my backpack on and started walking, only looking at the path and what the light on my lamp could show.\nAfter two hours I reached this spot, the sun was rising, a bit of fog was covering the valley, the lake was not too far, but thought to stop here for a moment, by myself, to admire the beauty of a new day.\nWe all need a somewhere place where to feel in peace with ourselves and everything.\n\n[1/1 original: 6675 × 4455 - Nikon D800 - 56mm - f11 - 1/100sec]\n\nLICENSE\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
