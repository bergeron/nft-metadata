    "name": "White Wind Kopher Bow",
    "description": "The Kophera tree is only found from Gaelin's Pass up to the Howling Moors. It is used to make the most coveted bows in all The Upper Land. The strength and bend of kopher wood allows for an accuracy at distance which cannot be matched by any other material. The Riders of the White Coast also known as The Ivory Riders of the North or simply the White Riders created this version of the kopher bow upon the founding of Marimor. Purely aesthetic, these enchanting bows are meant to encompass the allure of Marimor and the White Coast. The bow was given the name “white wind” during the attempted raid of Marimor in 1999 FA, just years after its founding, when the men of Braelin lay siege. Under the cover of night, the Riders of the White Coast, only 500 strong, flanked the nearly 10,000 men laying waste to their advances. The men who escaped with their lives said, “it was as though a white wind howled over us.",
