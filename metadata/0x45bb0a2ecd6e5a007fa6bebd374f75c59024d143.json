    "description": "Corners of a Sphere is an artistic proposal that relates two worlds, \"the sphere\" (VR painting) which I call the body, and â€œthe corners\" (physical painting) which I call the mind.  \n\nThe body or sphere is the beginning of everything, it is a round painting possible in virtual reality, it is a body born from the order of pictorial formats that results in a painting without a beginning or an end. This spherical body represents the analogy of the multiple sensory variables that are part of a single element, like that exercise of meditation, where all the parts are one.\n\nOn the other hand we have the \"corners\" that represent the mind. \n\nThe mind is the ability to select, to focus, to frame; it decides which is the beginning and end in relationship to the body. The corners or the mind are the extraction of 9 parts of the body with a preference to the aesthetics of an order. 9 physical paintings that were selected among the corners of a sphere. The body and the mind; the digital and the physical, in a dialogue to reflect on the expanded possibilities of painting.",
