    "description": "Inspiration:\nI'm a kid born in the 90s and grew up between the 90s and 2000s. So I have mixed feelings about both eras. I like many things in my childhood. I put them to this piece. The cassette was still popular. My grandma listened to the radio every night. The TV was old, and the show didn't available after 10pm (I think). Reading a book was my favorite activity since we had no technology like today.\n\nHowever, I love fantasy, so I imagined that everyone would have a group of little ghosts nearby, always be friends with everyone.\n\nStory:\nIn a cozy little room, a girl was enjoying her favorite book, and a dog was sitting nearby. The wind from the window brought the smell of earthy and natural grass into the room. A favorite song from the cassette player was playing. The little ghosts danced to the rhythm of the song. These happy moments were captured as animated work. I'm pleasured you saw it and hope you can feel your special moment.",
