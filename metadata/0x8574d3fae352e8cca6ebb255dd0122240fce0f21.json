How do I look? What is it that you see in me? \n\nAm I painting on the wall encompassing all that it means to be alive? Am I just a memory of colors put to paper? This is all we really will ever be in the physical right? When our time has come, what will be left, just thoughts, art made from your memories and wisdom, digital trails of your adventures, or will you be a ghost? \n\nAm I already dead, walking the plains, leading my tribe through the good and evil of this world? Or is this me trying to figure out what path to take with my demon and angel by my side following in silence, living in harmony between each other, accepting that they must both exist in order to be real? \n\nRegardless of what you think, none of this matters. What matters is what you did with this precious time that you have here and if you were truly happy or not. Life can be simple or be a drama. What do you choose? For you are a God. You have the power. You are the universe and the universe is you. So give all that you understand to be back to where you came from and you will find your truth and love. \n\n- Kyle Walling \n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/451dbb6d-a799-4b06-a2bd-0369a6e7bddc",
