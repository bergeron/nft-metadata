    "description": "Atelier Foils\nW/ Kelebekler\n\n# 1 / 7\n\nCuriosity is ignited as young artists (aged 4-6) encounter abstract artworks presented solely for their expansive surfaces and as available canvases.\n\nIn this collaborative research workshop, the young artists embark on a journey of artistic exploration. They set out to test how different types of paint and tools interact with this newly introduced surface. The creative process quickly evolves as the previous artwork's negative space starts to shrink.\n\nFor these young researchers, it is their first time painting on a surface larger than themselves. With each stroke, these young artists enthusiastically embrace the opportunity to leave their mark.\n\n*KELEBEKLER:\nADA FADİME KOÇ\nALİ TUNA AKKAN\nARAS GENÇ\nBULUT ÜNVERDİ\nCAN DEMİRCAN\nÇINAR ATA TÜRKMEN\nMETE ALP HAZIR\nSHAM  KALA\nEMİR KURT\n\n*ALSO FEATURING:\nNAZAN SERMA\nSALEHA REHMAN\nKÜBRA MURTÇU\nBEULA MOYO\nCANSEL GENÇOĞLU\nNORMA JEAN LEBOHANG\nG.
