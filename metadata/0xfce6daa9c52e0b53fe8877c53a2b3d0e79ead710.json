    "description": "Hurmetci Grassland, located in Kayseri province of Turkey, is home to hundreds of horses. The horses that were previously used by the villagers in the fields and in various farming jobs were not needed anymore because of the development of technology and so they were left in the Hurmetci Grassland. Later, these horses increased in number and their number reached hundreds, so they were adopted by the animal lover villager cowboy called Ali Dayi and these horses were able to survive by being fed by him in this plain which is always under the snow during the winter months. In the grassland that dries up in the summer, when all the horses run at once, magnificent views emerge with the dust cloud formed at sunset.\n\nAli Dayi, The Black Rider, is running his herd of horses to the pasture area with green grass at sunset in Hurmetci ,Turkey.\n\nArtist: Meriç Aktar\nCamera: Nikon D750\nDimensions: 6000 ×4000 - 18 MB\nResolution: 300 dpi ,24 mpx\nLocation: Kayseri, Turkey\nDate: 08/08/2022\nEdition: 1/1\n",
