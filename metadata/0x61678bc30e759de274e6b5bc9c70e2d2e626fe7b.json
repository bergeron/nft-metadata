By fusing the artificial (neon dust, black light) and natural elements (earth, flora) these mutations which I call KALEIDESCAPES emerge. \n\nThis artwork is named after one of many different translations of ‘Mother Earth.\n\nOriginal music composed for {{TRIP}} artworks by Nick Abnett. Nick was the bassist in British electronic bands; Sabres of Paradise, The Aloof and Death in Vegas to name a few. \n",
