    "description": "You about to click on a link?\n\nFor some crazy too-good-to-be-true free mint you saw on a Twitter account you didn't know was hacked? Or because you missed out on Bored Apes? Or on Cryptopunks?  \nOr whatever the latest thing is?\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nOr maybe someone's up in your DMs telling you they're gonna give you some Bitcoin?\n\nThey're not.\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nOr maybe human nature is kicking in and you're feelin' all hot and bothered? You wanna get your rocks off - from that supposedly hot thing tempting you in your DMs?\n\nStop.\n\nAnd Remember...\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nThis is your money.  \nYour bank. Your treasury.  \nYour Vault. To All your Art. \nYour Whole Collection.  \nYour Self-Sovereignty.  \nWhat you've worked hard for.\n\nAnd there are unsavory types out there that want to take it ALL from you.  \nA LOT of them.  \nAnd they are relentless.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nNO, IT'S NOT.\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nSlow down.  \nTake a breath.  \nIt's gonna be alright.\n\nBe mindful before you click on a link.\n\nOr better yet...\n\nJust\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nInspired by the people coming together to help CryptoNovo when his wallet got hacked - no one is above it. It can happen to any of us.  \nYou can lose everything.\n\nSo, please...\n\nDON'T CLICK ANY MOTHERFUCKING LINKS.\n\nProduced by jonsey.  \nMixed and Mastered by Che Brooks.  \nWritten, Performed, Engineered and Arranged by Guido Corleone.  \nVisual Art Created by Guido Corleone.",
