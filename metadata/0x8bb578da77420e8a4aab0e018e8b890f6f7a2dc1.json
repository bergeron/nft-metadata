    "description": "The noise of the urban environment, the noise from people, news bulletins, social networks, other people's opinions... Noise surrounds us wherever we go. How charged is he with negative emotions? Of course, the real problem is not the sound itself, but the reactions of our body and brain to sound, but sometimes it becomes so much that it becomes difficult to control it. \n\nBut what if this noise is already in your head, within the limits of your thoughts and non-periodic sounds, and the frequency that surrounds you every day, even when it seems to you that everything is calm around you?\n\nI Just want to quiet the noiseâ€¦\n\nSound: mr.pepper",
