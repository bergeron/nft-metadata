    "description": "I can think of nothing more serene than floating through the clouds towards a breath taking sunrise. As an early riser, sometimes I'm able to get out early and get lucky. This was absolutely one of those times. Although the sites of SFO are stunning, sometimes all you need is an immaculate sky to tell a story. It was ugly and overcast just before this shot but as luck would have it, the sky opened and lit up perfectly. One of my all-time favorite sunrises I've shot.",
