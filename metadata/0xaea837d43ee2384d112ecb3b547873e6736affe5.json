    "description": "When KHD decided to celebrate National Poetry Month by posting a poem every day on Twitter, she never imagined the micro-memoir that would grow from the lines. Her first collectible chapbook of poems takes us to Central Park, bursting with cherry blossoms; to an NFT NYC party where the poet eats cake off an artist’s face; to shadows surrounding the monuments in Washington, D.C.; and even into the bedroom. \n\nLargely composed in free verse, poetic forms spring up like wildflowers throughout the pages, including: haiku, cheritas, American sonnets, and the variation that KHD is perhaps most known for, sonnet minus ones. With a window seat on airplanes and a tumble on a train, with loss and with love, it turns out that a month of daily poems can water many dreams.\n\nTo read this book and access related features, visit https://alexandrialabs.xyz and connect your wallet.",
