    "description": "While on a solo hike into a spot to glass for wildlife I was startled by a deer bounding towards me. It got about 20m in front of me before it noticed me and bounded off into the forest to my left. Behind it was this beautiful black wolf in pursuit. \n\nOnce it saw me it immediately turned and started off in the other direction. I had my camera shouldered while walking and was able to get it ready while closing in on the spot I last saw the wolf. I noticed is in this clearing still trying to put distance between us (wolves are persecuted in British Columbia and a fearful of humans). I let out a sharp whistle and it stopped and looked, just briefly. I let off a burst of shots while crouched with my camera in hand. \n\nThis was one of the images from that burst. In 90 seconds it was over. I was emotionally shook and trembling by what had just happened. \n\nThis was the first encounter I have had with a wolf since the mid 90's and I am so grateful to have a chance to see this beautiful animal in the wild.",
