    "description": "\"Breathless loneliness\" is one of the works in \"The Suffocated People\" collection, available on Exchange.Art. These works were born out of the need to deal with anxiety and depression, and to talk about them through art. Depression and anxiety are silent illnesses, present in all fields of work.  \n\"Breathless Solitude\" shows how we suffocate alone, even when we are in a group. Art brings us a vision we don't have. That is the intention of this work. We can look differently, welcome and support. \nSo I want to share it with you, invite you to know and discuss about it. \n\n\"Breathless loneliness\" was created with mixed techniques: photography, collage, drawing and digital painting.  \n3000x3000px  \nDesigned between dec 22 and jan 23 by Moisés Pereira.",
