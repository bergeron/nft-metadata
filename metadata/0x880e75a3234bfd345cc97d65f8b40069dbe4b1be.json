    "description": "UFO in your yard.\nThe unique jewellery surprise eggs created in 1885-1917 by Peter Carl Faberge’s manufacture are the inspiration and the starting point of the collection. The egg as a symbol of a new life, the Faberge egg as a symbol of opulence.\nThe purpose of the creation of the “Faberge Life” collection is to convey the value of life, the extraordinary opulence of every single day and every single second.  It depends just on us how to live our lives and what meaning every day has for us. \n10% of the sales will be donated to Podari.Life charity foundation's projects, which helps children suffering from the oncological and hematological deseases.\n*Full description of the story told in every art work of the “Faberge Life” collection can be unlocked and become available just to this digital art object’s owner.",
