    "description": "acrylic medium on canvas. \n\nfeelings of loneliness, sadness, and not being able to speak up. seeing all those around, outcasting thoughts that are the truth. truth that trees are green, trees are nature, trees are suppose to grow..that the imperfections are what make us perfect. \nwhy is being true not the norm? \ni would rather be alone than to be a pink tree.
