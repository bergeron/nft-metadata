    "description": "There once was a bunny who dreamed big. He was gonna work really hard and become the best NFT trader of all-time. If degens could do it, this would be no problem at all. Unfortunately, like most big dreams, he went from working Wall Street to working fuzzy bunny ballz on the street. He did all his own research, made all the right moves, but was undercut by some other btch-ass bunny who was paper handing everything. Even through all the times he won, he could always count on 'stable coins' taking a dump on all the fun. So of course, he did what any respectable bunny would do: He said \"Fck'it, I'm gonna snort and smoke anything that moves.\"",
