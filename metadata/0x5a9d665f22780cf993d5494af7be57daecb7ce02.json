    "description": "3-tiered Kohaku.\nThe head is yellowish, but the thickness of the skin is attractive. The most attractive feature is the size of her head and her almost elongated body shape. She has a good height and a straight, well-styled body. Expectations are high for her future growth. She also has a very high potential for large size. The covering rings stand out beautifully. If the skin is thick, the covering scales will stand up. Beni is a glossy red mixed with pink and red. As it grows, it tends to become a dark red Koi. Shiroji has not yet been removed, but as it grows, Shiroji will be finished beautifully.",
