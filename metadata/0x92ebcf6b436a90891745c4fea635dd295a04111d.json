    "description": "As I scroll through my feed, I see\nThe works of artists, both bold and meek\nEach piece a masterpiece, unique and rare\nYet often, the artist is nowhere to be found, I swear\n\nTheir work speaks volumes, but they stay hidden\nBehind their screens, they remain unbidden\nAfraid, perhaps, to step into the limelight\nTo let their art shine, and take flight\n\nBut oh, if only they knew\nThe beauty and power they imbue\nTheir art with, if only they'd show\nTheir faces, their souls, let their true selves glow\n\nFor when we see the artist behind the art\nIt adds depth and meaning, a special part\nOf the creation we've come to admire\nTheir vulnerability, their passion, their fire\n\nSo to all you artists out there, young and old\nDon't be afraid to let your story be told\nTo show the world the person behind the brush\nAnd in doing so, make your art that much more lush.",
