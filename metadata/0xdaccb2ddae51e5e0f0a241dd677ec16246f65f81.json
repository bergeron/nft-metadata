    "name": "IN MEMORIAM MY MEMORY",
    "description": "Regret always comes late, deceived by the uncertain world. The choices that have been chosen become meaningless and abandon the opportunity to conquer time, Salvador Dali's \"The Persistence of Memory\" able to explain my feeling. My mind drifted to the past, when my brother met the woman he thought would be the one. He has sacrificed a lot to convince our parents that she is the one he has been waiting for all this time. My father couldn't believe it because we didn't know where he met that woman before. He was forced to betray our father's trust. His struggles ends with a feeling of revenge, wounds and abyss in his heart. I just want to scream to my ears, reminiscing the past, “stop him, don't let him do that”\n\nArtwork Size: \n3072x3072px\n\nArtwork Format:\nH264 (.MP4)",
