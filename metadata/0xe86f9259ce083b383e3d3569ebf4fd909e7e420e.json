    "description": "This painting was the very first channeled artwork I consciously created, and also my first NFT. As someone who lived in religion my whole upbringing, devotion has always been a way of life. I painted this painting to sponsor myself on my mission’s trip to India in December 2019, right before Covid hit. Throughout my spiritual expansion, my Love for Jesus has only increased. I deeply value the healthy Divine masculines in my life…my brothers, my fathers, my lovers, my friends. And I deeply honor my family and lineage for raising me in the Love of Christ. Physical painting dimensions: 30\" x 48\"",
