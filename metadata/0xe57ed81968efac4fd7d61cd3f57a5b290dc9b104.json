    "description": "One slip. Two fall. \n\nKing. Lioness. \nI collapse at the call.\n\nHe taught me to climb, she taught me to roar.  \nThrough darkness and light, we learned how to soar.  \nWe carved our own paths, opposed limitation,  \nGrew rich in adventure and honoured vibration. \n\nOn this mountain ridge, I pause. \nRewind.  \nLook back, to witness moon and earth align.  \nAs astrocytes glimmer like stars of the mind,  \nAn electricity, \nA presence, \nLights up my spine. \n\nAhhh, there you are. Of course, I was wrong.  \nAs waves are to water, souls eternal, live on.  \nIn Himalayan winds, within every crux,  \nForever connected in infinite flux.\n\nSolace. \nIâ€™ve found you.\n\nArtist: Alex Mackenzie  ",
