    "description": "PS: The Collector gets the physical piece in addition to the NFT.\n\nAbout the piece\nThe only thing that came to my mind while painting;\n“I realized I’ve been fighting all my life, I want to bloom.”\n\n“To the ones that feel inadequate, \nwe are all set to bloom at different seasons in different conditions… point is, we bloom.”\n\nThis is a piece on believing. When nothing makes sense, when you’ve put out so much of yourself but nothing seems to make sense. \nA rebirth is near. \nI recently had an epiphany through a conversation on “becoming” with a dear friend.  She explained how she no longer feels threatened by her peers success because she realized we all have different blooming seasons.\nUngratefulness robs us of our chances to live and be free. \nHere’s to focusing on you while holding on to faith.\n\nClick my Instagram to read up on my process.",
