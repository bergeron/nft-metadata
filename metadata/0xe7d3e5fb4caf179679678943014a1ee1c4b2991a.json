Using the Kinnara : Desi La track \"No Fear,\" Rimbawan has created stark, monumental graphics that are a statement of his usual amazing style. \n\n\"I imagined the giant artifact is a tribute to be sacrificed to a nearby star that some machine civilization pray to\" - Rimbawan Gerilya.\n\nThe CHROMATIC LACK OF GRAVITY NFT COLLAB PROJECT is a starting point for artists I greatly admire to interpret my music.
