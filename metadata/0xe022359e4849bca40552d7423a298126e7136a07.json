    "description": "New York Order attempts to present an alternate view of New York City. One that has been brought to order, disrupting the chaos and enabling people to understand the city more clearly. It will be formed from an ongoing exploration of all five boroughs. Like much of my work, this project comes from my desire to uncover a cities unique narrative hidden amongst its ordinary and ambiguous fragments. To accomplish this, I examine repetitive formal characteristics such as colors, patterns, textures and materials. By methodically composing these elements, an abstracted viewpoint is developed that offers a closer reading of a cities visual grammar, history and culture embedded within the street.\n\nThis image was taken on Grand St in Williamsburg. I spotted the two types of brick and how their edge was able to come into contact with the grey wall. This is the kind of mixture of materials I yearn to document.\n",
