    "description": "My photography of the land is a way for me to observe and capture both external and internal experiences. This specific series has been directly inspired by attempts to understand my lifelong and ongoing experience with major depression. These trips into the wilderness have always been an attempt to escape, rather than confront the mental illness that has shaped so much of my life and practice as an artist. It's a confusing disease that changes shape constantly, revealing itself only in silhouette and remaining just outside of comprehension. I'm haunted by it but also incredibly curious about the mechanism and function behind it. I want to observe it, but my light never seems bright enough. \n\n*\"The resulting images are hallucinatory in their intensity, evoking a fever dream or a psychedelic trip.\"*\n\n*[WIRED Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/hallucinatory-landscape-photographs/) – September 2019*\n\n**DARK_001**",
