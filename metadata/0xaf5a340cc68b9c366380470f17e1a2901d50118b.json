    "description": "Rings of Sherbert, ROS, is an interstellar traveler powered by rainbows, harnessing the energy of raspberries, limes, oranges and hundreds of other fruits that have yet to be named.  ROS launches its interstellar rainbow creating a wormhole that is the brightest of pastel colors and appears to the eye as a rich, creamy, radiant texture, a sight to behold. It travels almost effortlessly through galaxies while shining as a perfect halo scoop emerging at temperatures approaching -118 degrees F, nearly as cold as any temperature recorded on earth.",
