    "description": "It is my great pleasure to welcome Pell to Sound.xyz with our drop of u know what i mean. \n\nthe first demo of this song was recorded way back in 2016. Pell and I met for the first time that year and in between my touring with Marian Hill we would cook up in LA and leave each session with 2, 3 new songs.\n\nI have such fond memories of us pacing around the studio together, listening to Pell freestyle effortlessly and yelling out \"thats the hook!\" We found a magical chemistry back then that I think you can still feel in the music.\n\nThis is the first of two songs from back then that we are finally bringing to the light of day. We got together to put the finishing touches on them a few months ago in NYC, and as we laughed together in my studio it was like no time had passed at all.\n\nThis is a fun one. Enjoy responsibly.",
