    "description": "“Fundamental space explorations of naked singularity” is a set of questions that a person asks in the moments of searching for himself and his personality in the universe. \nThe man is unique, there is no same ones. At the scale of the universe, we are alone and trying to find ourselves anywhere and at any cost, often being aliens on our own planet.\nThrough analogy with cosmic motives and fake documentation, we show what is happening beyond the event horizon in which each of us is located.",
