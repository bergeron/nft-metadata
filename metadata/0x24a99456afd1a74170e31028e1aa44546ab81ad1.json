    "description": "A constellation is a group of stars gathered together forming patterns and shapes that illuminate in their celestial splendour against the wondrous canopy of our midnight skies. For me, this piece represents something beyond here, like a gateway between worlds. There is a feeling of power, beauty and wonder when gazing upon the night sky.\n\nOriginal piece is an acrylic painted canvas with intricate hand-drawn mandala designs and coated with e-poxy resin. 20x16\"",
