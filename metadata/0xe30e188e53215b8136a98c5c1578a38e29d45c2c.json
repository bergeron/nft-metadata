    "description": "\"The fragrance of a dead Rose\" is a story derived and inspired by the words of Emily Dickinson. Her story and words around death comforted me to look around and get inspired to define a path where energy is passed to an immortal realm. \n\nThis is also my genesis edition work on my smart contract. I hope this piece gives you meaning and defines a conversation we ignore at times. Remember this is not just a beautiful frame but a meaning that can be defined by many as you collect. \n\nMuch love,  \nFawkes",
