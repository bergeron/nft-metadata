    "name": "The Legend Of Kappiri",
    "description": "ജീവൻ പകർന്നുനൽകി ദൈവം മനുഷ്യനെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചപ്പോൾ, ജീവൻ എടുത്തുകൊണ്ട്  മനുഷ്യൻ ഒരു ദൈവത്തെ സൃഷ്ടിച്ചു, കാപ്പിരിമുത്തപ്പൻ\" Once upon a time, Cochin, a quaint port city in Kerala, was a Portuguese colony ruled by ruthless traders who pillaged and plundered everything they could set their eyes on. Driven by the greed for power, they enslaved Africans ('Kappiri'' in Malayalam) and brought them on ships like cattle - tormented and silenced. A few years later, the Dutch arrived, and a bloody war ensued. The Portuguese were forced to leave in haste. Unable to carry all the wealth that they amassed, they decided to bury their treasures in secret locations, along with their slaves. They chained the kappiris in wall niches and plastered them in  - alive - after making them promise that they'll safeguard the treasures until the rightful heirs arrive. Across time, the locals began worshipping these niches as they believed that the slaves morphed into Godly, guardian spirits or 'Kappiri Muthappans'. ",
