    "description": "This powerful artwork was created by putting together the photos of successful, brave, and inspiring Iranian women in honor of International Women's Day.\nIranian women have shown their courage and resilience to the world through their participation in the \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement, fighting for their rights and demanding change.\nBy featuring the photos of these strong women in this artwork, I hope to amplify Iranian women's voices and share their message with a wider audience.\nTheir determination and unwavering spirit serve as an inspiration to all women, encouraging them to continue fighting for what they believe in.\nThe original single image was created by myself to capture the 8th of March and then enhanced using AI technology.",
