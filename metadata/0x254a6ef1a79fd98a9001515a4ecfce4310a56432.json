    "description": "We often don't know what's possible until we're inspired to ask the right questions. Sometimes these possibilities are under our very nose, but in this case, it was above our very heads. This view was the result of rooftopping a friend's apartment building just outside of Denver. A quick question asked during a last-minute attempt to catch sunset led to eye-opening possibilities. We made our way to the roof and while some doors were locked, we found one that was propped open and it felt like it was meant to be. Although this building wasn't the tallest in the area, it provided for an amazing view. We were able to experience the sun's rays hitting the Denver skyline on one side and the sun setting behind a Colorado mountain range on the other. It was better than anything either of us could have imagined and a scene neither of us would have been able to experience if we hadn't asked, \"What if?\"",
