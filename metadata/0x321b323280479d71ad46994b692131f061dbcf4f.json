    "name": "Tale of Greed - Deforestation",
    "description": "Hark! The capitalist man, with axe in hand,\nDoth seeketh profit from the fertile land.\nHe chops the trees without a thought or care,\nFor in pursuit of gain, he is ensnared.\n\nYet in his greed, he fails to see the cost,\nThe consequences of his actions lost,\nFor with each tree he does so cruelly fell,\nHe doth metaphorically cut his leg as well.\n\nThe forests once did bloom, so lush and grand,\nBut now they wither, barren, dry, and bland,\nA sacrifice to money's endless supply,\nAnd in the end, the man will learn to cry.\n\nFor in his quest for wealth and fame,\nHe brought about destruction and shame,\nOh, how the heart aches to see,\nThe loss of nature's true beauty.\n\nBut alas, the man's eyes are blind,\nTo the destruction he leaves behind,\nFor profits and wealth he will always seek,\nEven as he cuts down his own feet.",
