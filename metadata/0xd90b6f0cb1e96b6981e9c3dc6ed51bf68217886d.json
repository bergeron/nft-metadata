    "description": "This painting demonstrates a paradox between “to be or not to be”.\nOne part of this woman has the desire to exist as she is looking toward the light. Although she is urged not to see or not to say anything but she still tends to see the beauty of life and hopes to express her emotions. The other part the dark side of her back has no desire to exist and is gradually disappearing. Yes she is tired of fighting, So what matters to her is ”TO BE OR NOT TO BE”. \nI’ve shown her paradox by the contrast of lightness and darkness as well.",
