    "description": "This 3d animation with sound describes unsociable people fears that calling every time. \n\nI saw this animated picture in my mind and sometimes I felt same issues . That's why I decided to make this with the help of Blender soft. Also added some annoying calling sounds to give the right atmosphere for the animation.\n\nFree your fears through the arts, free your thoughts through the creation\n\n1500x1800\n.mp4",
