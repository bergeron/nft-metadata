    "description": "I've always heard people telling me, \"you're different, youâ€™re weird.\" I was alienated and couldn't share what I liked with others and never felt like I was on the same page with the rest of the world. I have felt this way since childhood. But now I want to showcase who I am through my work, and share my lifelong passions in visual art and music with people who appreciate who I am. Music has provided the most inspiration and solace in my life. I want to collaborate with musicians and showcase my graphic designs alongside songs from dope artists. Purchasing my NFT will give me the opportunity to continue working on my craft, improving the quality of album art and music videos, and everything I create will be worth your time and investment in my dreams.",
