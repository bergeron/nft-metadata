    "description": "WE ARE BOOK PEOPLE. In the early days of Tally Labs/Jenkins the Valet, the team spent months reaching out to authors and literary agents in hopes of landing an author to pen Jenkins' debut novel. Some rejections let us down easy, others were pretty rude! This email serves as a reminder of how far we've come, how far we'll continue to go, and the importance of disruption. Together with our community AND the wider NFT space, we're changing what it means to be a book person.",
