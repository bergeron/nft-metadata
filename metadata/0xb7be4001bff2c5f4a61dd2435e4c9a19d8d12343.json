Can be merged with the RTFKT Space Pod by owning both and accessing oncyber.io.\n\nAs part of the clone Exodus from planet 42 Draconis b, the Loot Pod is being transported within the LootPod Cruiser ship for the journey ahead. The LootPod Cruiser shipâ€™s hibernation chamber and gen8 pilot AI makes it perfect for long-distance missions. A LootPod Cruiser ship can cruise in style with a SpacePod A-Class ship docked to its side.\n\nDigital Collectible terms and conditions apply, see https://rtfkt.com/legal-2D\n\nWhile now in flight aboard the LootPod Cruiser ship, the immersive interior Loot Pod experience continues on with OnCyber, (https://oncyber.io) enabling Loot Pod 3D customization and exploration, alone or with friends.",
