    "description": "Candidate has a message for you: «The META world has already come, and in this world everyone can be themselves, everyone can gain their freedom.  In the society of the future, no one will follow you and tell you what to do.  If you want that future to become your real present, choose that freedom now.  Choose a Candidate!»\n\nMeaning of the series: We live in a time when standards cover everything, but these standards turn out to be double very often, depending on the goal of the one who promotes them. How often we hear one thing but see something completely different in practice!\n",
