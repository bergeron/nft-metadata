    "description": "From the most successful installation of 'The Colour of Code' collection, we bring you the collectors' edition Geode. Bearing multiple shades of blue and gold, this Geode is an airdrop to all holders of pieces from 'TCOC', 'Inner Child', 'Jazz in the Rain' and 'Unwritten Scripts' collections as a token (pun intended) of appreciation for the belief and support that they have shown in multiple ways to the creators and the projects. We hope you value this royal and heartfelt gift; from us to you. \n\nGenerative Art made entirely with p5js. Brought to life by Kamau Kamau and Ian Wright",
