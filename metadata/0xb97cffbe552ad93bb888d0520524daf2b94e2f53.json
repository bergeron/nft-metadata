    "description": "Starting with a special piece in to the collection.\n\nThis is a shot of the \"Geisler Group\" a iconic mountain range in South Tyrol and all over the Dolomites. \nIn 2009 declared as Unesco World Heritage.\n\n------\nA small personal Story to the shot.\n\nThis shot was taken by me on a two day photography work shop in the mountains.\nAfter the whole day of shooting all of us got tired so we were heading back to our shelter for the days.\nThe Sun was setting and on the walk i had a strange urge, as something isn't quite right.\nI was already falling behind to the rest of the group but i stopped, looked around in the landscape and saw this majestic scenery. \nI ran as fast back to those cabins as i could because i know, such scenerys move quick and don't stay the same for to long.\n\nSo i made this shot and enjoyed the view while all the oders just passed by and didn't even see it because they were to deep in theyr conversations.\n\nSigned Print available for shipping WW\n42 cm x 60 cm\n16,54 x 23,39 inch\n",
