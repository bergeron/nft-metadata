    "description": "Zodiac creates good and bad prejudice within people. It is because we are the people who rely on the belief that our personality and future since we were brought into this world are judged based upon it, and we believe everything it said as if they’d truly happen. On behalf of the truth, everything has been set by the Almighty, and you only do a job on what perspective you’d like to live in your life.",
