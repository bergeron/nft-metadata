    "description": "Stark radiance and the natural manipulation of man. \nTangled labors of organic sensitivities. \nAwareness.\nEnergetic leaks and the captured embodiment of shadows.  \nA celebrated marriage of flow & restraint. \n\n\nThis is a the piece created in order to speak the inspirations of the natural art of Andy Goldsworthy. With great respect and admiration; Guy found a moment to share through the lens of emotional absorption and spectral reflection. \nA cerebral glimpse into the sight of this viewer.\n\nHard lines and blurred contrasts - like images burnt into forgotten sight. Dancing movements and cold stillness - each part representing the whole experience of witnessing Andy's masterful connection to the earthen orchestra of landscape.     ",
