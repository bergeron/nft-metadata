This is my reading of legendary art in the modern world. \nArt has no expiration date; it is always current, modern, and timeless. The world changes daily and we change along with it, but in spite of that, art stays with us invariably. \nArtists used to look for pigment for their paints, but now they look for new marketplaces to place their NFTs. And this in no way negates the creative part of the process. \nWe cannot eradicate the love of beauty.\n\n6000*9000 pixels, 500 dpi",
