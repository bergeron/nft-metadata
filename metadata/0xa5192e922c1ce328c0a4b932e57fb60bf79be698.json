    "description": "This image is from the Bolivian Salt Sea\nThe Northern Alps in Japan is a famous region that has the most snowfall in the world. In the country of Bolivia, there is a region that turns into an amazing phenomenon on certain days of the year. The salt lake of Bolivia is where the boundary between the sky and the earth disappears and an incredible view is formed. This vast area turns into the world's largest natural mirror with a little rain. I took this photo just before sunset. Thank you so much for checking out my photos.\nI would be delighted if you would add my mountain photo to your wonderful collection.",
