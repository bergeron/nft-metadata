    "description": " The thing that had been watching people was watching me at that moment. Looking back, through the act of shooting I got many comforts, overcoming the feeling of being alone. Our language was based on the dichotomy such as life and death, holiness and secularity, private possession and communal sharing, truth and false, continuity and severance, phenomenon and essence, old and new, past and present and so on.  But in reality there is no point of distinction between the such things, and when I capture the images with my camera, I realized that there could be a passage in the picture when I overcome the distinction. \n\n  The intention behind my ‘Passage’ is to find the space or objet and represent it and show that it serves as a ‘passage’ connecting one dimension to another, because I think the space or objet is a sort of doors, or a passage. The passage is an exit and, at the same time, an entrance, and it is inside or outside of an objet at the same time. ",
