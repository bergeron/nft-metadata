    "description": "If you were 18 years old living in mid-eighties New York & if u were in my skin, u were a club kid when clubs were kings of New York & u were in The Fun House this 1 night & u were w/ your bud Adolfo sweat-dancing each w/ a gal from Ozone Park who addressed u both as \"youz guys\" each time they talk to you and one slipped a cigarette to you that tasted funny-sweet and half an hour later the gals were gone and u both were standing with your backs against a wall because one of u had said there was this hole going down to some center of the earth right at your feet. And we spend that day with backs on the carpet at my place staring at the ceiling and somewhere in the afternoon Adolfo said in a heavy Colombian accent, “Youz Guyz, that was Angel’s dust.” \n\nThe dude in this photograph reminded me of myself back then because there are stairs in front of him which my camera did not register. And now he will live forever here in this Ether. More @ www.ma9.co, under FINE ART / LABYRINTHS / LEAP.",
