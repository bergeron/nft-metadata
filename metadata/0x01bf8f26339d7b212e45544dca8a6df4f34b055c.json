    "description": "Sometimes bad things happen. We are so sad and disappointed… we go to depression and it seems the darkness never ends… but we have cute cozy corner with amazing and warm memories deep inside us even in the most dark times. There is something from the past or maybe what you like.\nWe should remember about these cute things. They are inside us. They will help us to save our brain and soul. These things will help us to stand when bad things happen…\n\nTechnique: Procreate\nSize: 6000x6000, 600dpi\nRGB",
