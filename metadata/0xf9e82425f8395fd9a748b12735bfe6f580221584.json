    "description": "I made this image of horses in the rural countryside near Tel Aviv. I was told these blindfolds are called fly masks and used to protect their eyes from the flies that swarmed around nearby chicken coops. \n\nThe LOMO camera company sent me a prototype of the LOMO LC-Wide to test on a visit to Israel, before the camera became commercially available. This is one of the resulting photographs that were used to promote the LOMO LCWide's release.\n",
