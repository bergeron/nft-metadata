    "description": "These two small stone structures erected at the top of the mountain become our guardian lions, as their shape from a distance would be confused with that of a human silhouette. This resourceful trick was one of the many things I learned while managing a small mine in the desert of Ica, Peru.\n\nMy photograph is part of a pictorial ledger done in collaboration with fellow Peruvian poet & illustrator Daniel Magui√±a, who I commissioned to illustrate in-and-around my photographs.\n\nMy idea behind this \"archive\" was to offer a rare artistic window into the often-unknown life of Peruvian miners, which is filled with so much mystery, superstition, silence, and unspoken hardship.\n",
