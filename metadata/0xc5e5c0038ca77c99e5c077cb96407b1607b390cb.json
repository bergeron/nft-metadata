    "description": "I had the privilege to visit Alaska for the first time in 2015. Since then I fell in love with its unique natural environment: Alaska became a lifetime project. Every year I try to spend time in the wilderness seeking an intimate way to portray its beauty. This picture represents one of the most intense moments I could remember during my life. It was September 2015, when after two weeks of waiting, I was lucky enough to experience an amazing mix of extraordinary elements, which I will never forget: the impressive display of the autumn colors at their top and the first snow of the season",
