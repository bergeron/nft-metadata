    "description": "Welcome to my “Comic Book Japan” series!\nI feel it’s only appropriate to begin the series with my photo of one of the most iconic Mount Fuji street scenes.  \nWith a nod to Andy Warhol, I’ve taken certain creative liberties to portray Fuji in a variety of uniquely dynamic styles. \nUsing wild color schemes straight from the pages of my old comic books, Mount Fuji is transported into a radical world of colorful fantasy.",
