    "description": "A retired old man who is narcissistic. \nHe thought that everyone in the world would be afraid of him. \n\nBut in reality, no one feared him at all. \nEspecially if talking about his past and heroic deeds, then everyone would pity him. \nBecause he clearly had a mental illness since childhood. because he is addicted to nonsense history\n\nToday was his birthday and the hospital held a celebration. \nBut it wasn't a celebration for this man. \nBut it's a celebration for a world that's counting backwards. waiting for the day to get better",
