    "description": "‘Glass on water’ is inspired by organic lifeforms, mostly by sea/ocean-forms, plants, flowers and corals, by searching for new forms and compositions of multiple glass blown sculptures into colorful imaginary art installations on water. Inspired by everything created by the brilliant Dale Chihuly glass art studio. Working on this series brings me to the state of peaceful contemplation of beautiful, large-scale, natural, colorful glass blown forms being reflected on water. Created with text-to-image synthesis and overpainting by Yura Miron in 2022.  ",
