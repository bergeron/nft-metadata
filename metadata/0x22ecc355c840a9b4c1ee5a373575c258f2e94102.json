    "description": "22° Above Downtown is a photo overlooking Downtown Little Rock District. Taken in cold weather at high elevations. I originally re-located to Little Rock Arkansas to provide a life for my daughter who was born blind so she can attend a great school for blind children. Im now on a mission to share how beautiful the state of Arkansas is through my street photography collection Arkansas to the World.",
