    "description": "Like many apprentices, Zachary Laine found his artistic voice through hard labor. His father, a contractor and artist himself, was an assistant of Keith Haring’s and was never afraid to get his hands dirty. Laine’s “Signature Series” is an exploration of New York City graffiti in its rawest form, a gritty affair that mixes concrete, white-washed walls, and the red ink of passion, blood, or “wrong answers.” In his case, breaking all the rules paid off, and we are proud to have Zachary Laine’s debut NFT as part of the OrangeHare collection.",
