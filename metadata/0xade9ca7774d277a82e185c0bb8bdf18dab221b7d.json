    "description": "This work is entirely composed of photographs taken with a smartphone (Google Pixel series). Today, photography has become a symbolic expression used by everyone as much as text. The smartphone is a tool that will continue to evolve in the future. In other words, the theme of the \"Pixel\" collection is \"text written by photography.\n\nThe work entitled \"Torus\" is an experiment in visual interpretation of the blockchain. I am thinking about chains of value and meaning, about exchangeable asymmetries.",
