    "description": "ECDYSIS is the process of shedding the old skin, the biological molting of an outer layer or covering and the formation of its replacement.\n\nWhen ETH (Ecdysis Triggering Hormone) is released, it acts as a command chemical to trigger a behavior sequence critical for shedding of the exocuticle. Ecdysis is the moment when this process is complete, and the old cuticle starts to come off. The new cuticle is initially very soft but hardens in a few hours.\n\nThis artwork is inspired by this process that exists in nature itself. Emphasizing our endless renewal cycles that happen in personal time periods and our steps around these which lead to growth in different aspects of our lives and experiences.\n\nMay this new chapter bring you a chance to shed your old skin that has fulfilled its time and let yourself be covered with miracles of new beginnings and transformations. Happy New Year!",
