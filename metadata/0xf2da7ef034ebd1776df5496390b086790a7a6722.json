    "description": "'Vision Spell - Qreclaim'  is a hyper connected spiralling groupingm portraying the direct gazes of Athenian Queer youth in revolt. Captured in the final throws of a two night marathon dance party known infamously for its decadence - as if it were an ancient Dionisian ritual stepped forward in time - from a similar Athenian location, millenia past. \n\nPhotographed, faxed and zerox collaged into a large scale choreographed, frenetic, time travelling, spiral, the 'Vision Spell - Qreclaim' offers the viewer a transfixing window in to an intoxicating dance vortex, one Greek night in November 2021.",
