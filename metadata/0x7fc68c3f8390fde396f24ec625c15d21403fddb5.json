    "description": "Hang is drawn to amorphous compositions: incense smoke rising from religious shrines; cloud formations by her island’s dynamic weather, or spider webs, encountered on trails. Strand Series deploys a script, using particle systems. Hang creates layerings of line segments that produce cloud-like variations and a smokey, webby quality. The works’ generative aspect uses algorithms, which randomly choose from variants, within parameters tailored to Hang’s aesthetic choices. Data from tropical storms or humid days create graphic patterns of cloud formations. Time of day is depicted by dark, saturated hues or light, transparent ones. Hang’s compositions are iterative; she discovers what the work will be by tweaking layers, color variants, blend modes, and origin points, towards surprising textures, saturation, opacities, hue combinations, line sets. Aesthetic delight comes from a composite of chance, iteration, and self-guided discovery.",
