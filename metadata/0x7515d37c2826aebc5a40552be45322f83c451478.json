    "description": "Rain is good. If it's raining, it means the sun will be up soon. Fear is wonderful because it makes us feel and think. Sadness is normal, it helps us to be more sensitive and experienced. A Cat is also good, he can be a great friend or just a pleasant conversationalist. The magic potion is cool, it gives you the ability to become omnipotent. Think about what you love and do it. Do not be afraid if something goes wrong, the main thing is sincerity. And if you also cook a dish that everyone loves, then it will be just wonderful. tRoSiP! ©️ 2023 the Art of Alexander Tsyganov",
