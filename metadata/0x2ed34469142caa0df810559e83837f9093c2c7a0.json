    "description": "The train for Koria\n\nThe Korian are a proud and fierce people. They stand tall on their webbed feet, their bulging muscles rippling beneath their green and brown skin. Each warrior wears a helmet adorned with the horns of a bull, and they carry massive axes and shields into battle.\n\nBut the Korian are more than just skilled warriors. They were also clever and resourceful, using their knowledge of the land and sea to thrive in their harsh environment. They build sturdy longboats to navigate the rough waters and construct longhouses to shelter their families.\n\nDespite their rough exterior, the Frog Vikings are a community-oriented people. They valued loyalty and honor above all else, and they always stand together in times of hardship. They believed in the power of tradition and passed their customs and stories down from generation to generation.\n\nThe Korian are a unique and formidable tribe, feared and respected by all who encountered them.",
