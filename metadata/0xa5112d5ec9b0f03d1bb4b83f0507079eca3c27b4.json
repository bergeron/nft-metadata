    "name": "Fishing Net Repairing",
    "description": "Vietnam has always been a country I planned to see one day. When I decided to go to Vietnam in July 2016, I went to a fishing net repairing shop. In the shop, there was more than 10 women employed and they were all working on repairing the fishing nets. It was a sight that was so exciting to see. The colours of the fishing nets and the view that it created was stunning.\n In this area of Vietnam, fishing is the main source of income. Therefore, fishermen of Vietnam go fishing every morning in the early lights. But after every fishing trip, fishing nets get ripped off and they need to be repaired.\n Women in traditional work clothes and straw hat are the ones in responsible of repairing the fishing nets. They use needle and thread to do so. Nets can reach to the length of 50 meters and filling the ruptures can take hours of work. Nonetheless, Women of Vietnam are still joyful and happy as they are in every field of life. I hope to be there again.\nImage Size: 5364x3576, 300 DPI, 23.7 MB",
