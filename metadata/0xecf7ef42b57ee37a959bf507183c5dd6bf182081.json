    "description": "Tune In was painted in 2019 with acrylics on a 24\"x24\" wood panel. \"Tune In #0 - Original\" NFT was given to the original buyer of the painting. 20 limited edition physical prints were released of this work, and purchasers of the prints received the corresponding numbered NFT for free. It cannot be guaranteed that NFTs and physicals will be sold together after initial sale. You will have to contact the current owner with inquiries.\n\nTune In depicts a woman gazing confidently with the Ethereum logo painted on her face. She is a citizen of the metaverse and represents the readiness of our ecosystem to go forth and build the future. The metaverse being multifaceted, the piece shows multiple NFT projects in the background. This piece acts as a timestamp for the NFT ecosystem in early 2019 as we see some of the most popular projects of that period: CryptoPunks, Cryptovoxels, CryptoKitties, Chain Breakers, Autoglyphs, Neon District, Plasma Bears, and Decentraland. \n\nHave you tuned in?",
