    "description": "üåü All collectors who share their 2023 New Year's Resolution in a comment are eligible for an airdrop from my Sound collection üåü\n\nLots of things changed for me in 2022.\n\nI moved to Brooklyn, switched careers, ended a long-term relationship, quit weed, traveled everywhere from Paris to Bogot√°, moved OUT of Brooklyn, released my debut single and genesis music NFTs...you get the point.\n\nIn the midst of all of this I have attempted to become more discerning in my day to day life. Every day brings new decisions. How will I show up for myself? Which relationships will I prioritize? Which habits will I direct my time and energy to?\n\nNOT4ME was my first attempt to answer these questions as I began to face my vices, cut my losses and chart a course for healing. I am grateful for the chance to share this stripped down version of NOT4ME for the first time here on Sound, and I hope you enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•\n\nWritten & performed by AL3C\nMixed by Mixed Emotions Music",
