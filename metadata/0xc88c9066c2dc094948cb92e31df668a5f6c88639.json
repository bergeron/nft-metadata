    "description": "Suppose you are an advanced apparatus. To understand your world, you constantly project yourself out onto the world, and others impose meanings on you in the process; introjection. You, for example, have learned to see interior spaces like your kitchen, your bedroom, and maybe even the bathroom, as feminine spaces. Suppose a different apparatus, say, a projector, disrupts this cliché; then you’ll have to reconsider others concepts, thoughts, understandings. So, we know that the projector can manipulate, or it can even tease... The projector uploads a new symbolism to the old milieu. And the whole thing is like a certain linguistic disorder maybe an aphasia, capable of causing change to the virginity of the space.",
