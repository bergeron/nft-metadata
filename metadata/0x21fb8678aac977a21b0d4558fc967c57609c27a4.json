    "description": "Dance PM is part of the collection \"Sleep Dreams\", an extension of real pieces in the metaverse, with no physical limits, no boundaries.\n\nSelf Reflection, an armchair made in real life got its own dancing version in the metaverse. \n\nEach sheet soars above the water, ballet-like, infinitely disassembling and reassembling. Simple and pure. The immobile object thus becomes a source of perpetual motion, and a dialogue is forged between the reflections of water, metal and lights.\n\nThe first person (and only) to buy this NFT will have the physical version of Self Reflection, engraved with the ETH address, delivered to their door.\n\nFind out more about Self Reflection on www.waiting-for-ideas.com",
