    "description": "A R O U N D  M I D N I G H T\nI spent several weeks in Greenland, sailing on a boat around Disko Bay during the summer solstice.\nDuring this period, the sun never sets. He is mocking us. Certainly, the star descends slightly towards the horizon in the evening, but does not set: it rises slowly in the sky after midnight becoming a second day without night. It is called the \"Midnight sun\".\n\nAll photos of my serie were taken around midnight, between 9 pm and 4 am. Each photo is named with its time. Then, the night becomes a new field of exploration...\n \n\nHi-res JPG\n6000x4000px",
