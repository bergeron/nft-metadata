    "description": "Conserve NFTs focus on establishing a regenerative, inclusive, and interconnected economy that recognizes local cultures as the founding pillars of a thriving society. Sarapiqui collection from Costa Rica (ZIP code 41003) is the first NFT project of CONSERVE. The art that's contained in each NFT is captured by the Costa Rican audiovisual studio, WIMBLU. They dedicate their work to the creation of stories that reconnect ecology and culture in order to restore our sense of connection and belonging to the planet. We are proud to have WIMBLU on board, showing the essence of the very humid, tropical primary forest Conserve is protecting in Sarapiqui, Costa Rica.",
