    "description": "Years living as a hermit, speaking to only to himself and the natural world around him, has left our Halfling a bit mad. If you cross his path, you'll find he's chatty and generous. However, according to chatter among the local fauna, he can turn dark, moody, and possessive if he thinks you covet and of his home-made figurines. Tread carefully!",
