    "description": "The Notorious - 2Pac cassette under shrink wrap. \nTwo legends of hip-hop on the same album. A collaboration dreamed by many that will only exist visually. \n\nFollowing my successful photography series of rare and legendary albums on tape, I wanted to create a collection of cassettes that gathered iconic artists. The hypothetical collaborations unfortunately never happened, however each piece invites the viewer to personally explore how name association informs their own interpretations and projections of what the music could have been.\n\nThe shrink wrap connotes the rarity and collectability of the object itself while reflecting on the preciousness of such collaborations.",
