    "description": "I created this mixedmedia artwork on paper with acrylics, oil, inks and collage in the beginning of 2021. It has a size of 27x37cm and currently lives an analog life in Vienna, Austria. \n\nFrom December 2021 to January 2022 the artwork was chosen to digitally travel into a Virtual Reality Exhibition curated by Sergio Gomez. He wrote in the exhibition blurb: \"The exhibition explores our perception of size and scale when viewing a work of art by manipulating the environment in which it is presented for viewing. **Does our appreciation and understanding of a work of art change based on how big or small we perceive it to be?**\"\n\nIn April, 2022, this artwork travelled web3 and I minted it as an NFT. I wonder now: \"**Does our appreciation and understanding of a work of art change based on where and in which format it exists?**\"\n\nKindly send me a DM if you are the first owner of the NFT. I will gladly send the analog original artwork to you free of charge. \n\n\n",
