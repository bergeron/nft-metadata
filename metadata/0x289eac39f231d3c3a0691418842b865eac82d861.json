The vibe was absolutely incredible - folks were happy to be back celebrating their love of all things geeky. There is no place on the planet like a large-scale comic con and I have only missed 1 year since 2013. Often times NYCC was my main time to shoot during the year and I definitely learned a lot about photography shooting in this chaotic environment - probably why I fell in love with street photography as I would gravitate towards candid moments.\n\nI hope you enjoy this shot of one of the best cosplays I encountered at the event, mashups are always incredible and I caught this Pirate Joker in some incredible light.",
