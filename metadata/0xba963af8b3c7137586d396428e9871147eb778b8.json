    "description": "unique AI portrait Art series by Lars Nagler\n3500 x 3500 pixel jpeg\n\n-\nthis series is a reflection from the book \"Never Let Me Go\" by K. Ishiguro\n\nin simple terms, it is about clones that exist only to donate vital organs to the original later. \nwe see clones without an identity of their own, trapped in time partitions whose duration they do not know and which do not allow them any enjoyment of life. \n\nthey are \"on hold\" - for someone else.",
