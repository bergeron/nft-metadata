    "name": "VIDEO : Resurrection of the human potential",
    "description": "As nature and humanity we long for something different now. We know that it is possible to create a more diverse and decentralized society.\nIt is time for the resurrection and further development of human capacities. \nWe will integrate technology, new democratic management and natural abundance and freedom. This is a natural law best known and described By Charles Darwin in 1853 : ‘Tree of life’, Goethe and many others before and afterwards. I personally love the ’Fantastic Fungi’ film as an illustration for all of this. My previous projects about space and time bubbles, the impossibility to love and black holes of ignorance challenged reality and imagination. Nature has and will continue to be my inspiration.\nThis natural web of live (6) is also visible in most of the plants, the crown of a tree and the antlers of the deer.\n\nI believe as an artist that when every human would develop into its full potential, we could create a more sustainable world.\nSo let us all become artists now !",
