    "description": "  \n Persephone\n\nHe saw her and marveled:\n\"I have never had anyone like her before.\"\n\nCora, Proserpina, Persephone: different hypostases of the beautiful goddess of spring, whose beauty conquered the God of the realm of the dead himself.\nShe combined the innocence of a child with burning passion. A subtle storm gleamed in her virginal gaze. A perfect mystery. The perfect woman.\n\nThe beloved daughter of Zeus and Demeter, whom her parents shielded from the outside world, but could not keep out \nOur lives are a perpetual search for and acceptance of ourselves. We are changing, and it is important to open ourselves to change, to find Proserpine in ourselves, to be Cora first, in order to become Persephone later.\n\n1/1 NFT\nOil on canvas in mixed media\n\n8000 x 10000 \n\n\n ",
