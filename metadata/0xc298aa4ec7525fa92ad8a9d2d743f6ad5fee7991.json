    "description": "I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of death and like many, I was terrified of it. The great unknown lies ahead for all of us. It doesn’t care who you are or how much money you have - it’s the great equaliser for both kings and peasants. In the end we will all be the same; a fading memory slowly drifting towards oblivion. This might sound strange but as I got older I found comfort in knowing that I’m insignificant in the grand scheme of things. We truly don’t know what happens to us in the end.\n\nThe present is all that matters.\n\n“He who would teach men to die would teach them to live.” - Michel de Montaigne\n\nMark Constantine Inducil is known for creating deeply personal, vivid and colourful pieces of art inspired by real-life experiences, philosophy, psychology and past traumas. This piece signifies his first minted monochromatic artwork.\n\n(Created in Cinema 4D, Octane and After Effects)",
