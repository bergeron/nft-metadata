    "description": "BE LIKE BRANDO:\nThis collection of images is my love letter to my mother and Marlon Brando. My mom, my rock, my foundation; unwavering and steadfast. She epitomizes the character in these images, an empowered yet empathetic, loving woman, beautiful and vulnerable. A woman who embodies the spirit, confidence, gait of Brando.\n\nThese film images were shot on the historic corner of Hollywood & Highland. A magical place my heart will always hold space for. As an immigrant 9 year-old, I learned English by watching the films of Brando, James Dean, John Wayne and Marilynn Monroe. I imagined them all living in a mansion on Hollywood & Highland. A place I would visit one day and was certain to see Brando standing there, smoking his cigarette. Of course that is not the case, but that image has lived in my mind since that 9 year-old conjured it up, and now it will live forever in the metaverse. Full circle.\n\nThe name of the collection came from the simple direction I gave Alex; Be Like Brando\n",
