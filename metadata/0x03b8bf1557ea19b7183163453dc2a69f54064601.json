    "description": "In 2012 I made a life-sized Mirror Wolf sculpture as the title-piece for my solo show WOLF in London.\n\n10 years on and I am still fascinated by the relationship humans share with wolves and as they are being reintroduced into the wild, our perception is expanding.\n\nWhen wolves return to a region, they alter the behaviour of their prey, which impacts surrounding plants and animals, changing the natural landscape itself and balancing the natural forces that shape this world. Once again, we are reminded that everything is connected.\n\n+++\n\nThe first collector will receive a physical mini mirror wolf sculpture. Dimensions 61 x 29 x 22cm.\n\n1280 x 1280 mp4 video\n\nSoundscape designed by John Hassell \n",
