    "description": "This image was taken in New England National Park in New South Wales, Australia. The viewing deck overlooking this valley was located just a couple minutes away from my tent. Getting up, around 4:30am just to see this, was more than worth it!\n\nCloud Inversion happens when cold air is 'trapped' below warm air which holds mist and fog closer than usual to the ground. If you are lucky enough to be standing on a hill when it happens you can be treated to incredible vistas of a sea of cloud, with island-like mountain tops rising out of the mist. \n \nArtist: Mike Furkalowski",
