    "description": "Hot pink trees lined the street. Their tiny flowers, like small trumpets, shimmered in the wind. He stopped and stared, taking it all in. It seemed more fantastical than real, like a land from the pages of a Dr. Seuss book sprung to life. But it was real, it was there in front of him. So, he gave in and kicked up the fluorescent-colored petals, reveling in their novelty. But as he frolicked down the street, he was so consumed by the neon color that he didn’t stop to question what might be lurking in the house with its curtains drawn on such a perfect day.\n\nBehind the Green Door is a photo from Chase Baxter’s series, Spring Porn. The collection captures florals in an effort to explore the feeling of pleasure, as well as some of the often-accompanying emotions such as joy, euphoria, nostalgia, and even sometimes shame.\n\nTaken on 120mm film.  \n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA. 2021. \n",
