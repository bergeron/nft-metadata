    "description": "The Pill 2 - 2017\n\n\"Grant Riven Yun - Early Works\" is a series of compositions created at the very beginning of Yun's digital art career (2016-2017). Each piece was created on Microsoft PowerPoint using 1 layer by taking the shapes tool to manipulate shapes to create silhouettes of objects. Without the options and capabilities of a dedicated digital illustrating tool, Yun's style was shaped by necessity and limitations of the software he used. His style today incorporates much of the same techniques used in this series.",
