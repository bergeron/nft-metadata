I am everything convenient for me to be.  \nThere's fluidity in my strength. Because there is more to power than bruteness.\n\nI am in a war of your making, but I will take your pieces off my board.  \nYou have no rights here. I have evolved beyond your definitions. You have no say here.\n\nMy love is valid. My person is good. My life is right.  \nThere is no shame here. Not anymore.\n\n6000 x 6000px",
