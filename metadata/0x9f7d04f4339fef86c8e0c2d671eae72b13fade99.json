    "description": "Emily Lazar is a multi-disciplinary artist fronting the rock/metal transmedia project, September Mourning, who made history as the first female metal/ hard rock musician to mint and sell an NFT. She has over 750 collectors over various platforms and  she has spoken about her accomplishments in NFTs at Harvard, NFT.NYC and ETH Denver. \n\nSeptember Mourning is a transmedia project based on a comic book series she wrote and published through Image/Top Cow Comics with her business partner Marc Silvestri (Batman/Witchblade/Darkness). September Mourning is the title character. As a human reaper hybrid, she  gives expired souls a second chance at life in another body. In doing so, she messes with  the plans of the antagonist, Fate, who is trying to rid  earth of all the good souls and leave the bad so the world will self-destruct and It can start anew. An epic war between the living and the dead ensues. Emily plays the title character on stage.\n\nEmily designed the world she and her band (Rich Juzwick, Kyle Mayer and Aaron Hoover) bring to life on stage, including costumes, choreography, sets, etc. The band has toured with & opened festivals for Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Mudvayne and others across Europe and the United States.\n\n\"Dirty\" is an in your face, heavy hitting, percussive, driven, epic, hard rock/ metal track that speaks to anyone who has ever felt f*cked over by someone else. The track has a push and pull in the music, lyrics and vocals that follow the pulse of the marching drums in the choruses. \nAs pertaining to the graphic novel, this song exemplifies the feelings September has towards Fate during the plot twist of the very last book.",
