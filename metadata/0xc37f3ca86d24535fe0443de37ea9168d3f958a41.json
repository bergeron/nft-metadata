    "description": "\nBottlemen and friends are a combination of nature and humans and objects. It's nothing, but it can be anything. They comfort us with two feelings of joy and sadness. Circles that go round and round are something that can be flowers or balloons. All of this may look different depending on the viewer's feelings.",
