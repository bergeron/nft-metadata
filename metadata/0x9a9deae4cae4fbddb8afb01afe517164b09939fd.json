    "description": "-Nothing There to See-\n\nDo not venture off the path\nThe well intended plea\nFalse opinions back to back\nThere's nothing there to see\n\nDo you feel it? That draw within you that beckons a certain path? Your vision may not be seen by others but it is yours to craft and bring forth.\n\n1/1 digital piece that is the result of years of devotion making physical floral with personally restored Victorian Era tools that were long cast aside by society. This floral has been paired with AI reinterpretation. \n\nA true collaboration of passion, antiquity and the modern advances in art.\n\n",
