    "description": "Philippe Halsman (1906-1979) was interested in psychological portraiture, and 101 of his photos appeared on the cover of LIFE Magazine, but he also had a wild creative streak that he explored over 37 years with his friend Salvador Dali, which resulted in iconic portraits of the artist, as well as images which have transcended the world of photography and become recognized world wide. This Dali file from the Halsman Archive contains 4x5 contact prints and negatives from a 1954 sitting for the book _Dali's Mustache_ -a photographic interview, where Halsman asked a question on one page, and Dali answered it on the next page in the photograph. The first question of the book is \"May I ask you a few questions?\", and the following page shows this portrait of Dali, with the text \"Yes, but don't try to uncover my secret.\" This photograph of Dali has perhaps become one of the most iconic portraits of the artist, seen around the world in exhibits, books, street art, and derivative work. In the archive we refer to it as \"Page 11\", because that is the page it appears on in _Dali's Mustache_. Philippe Halsman's work is represented in countless museums and private collections around the world.  ",
