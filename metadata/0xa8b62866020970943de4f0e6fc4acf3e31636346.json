    "description": "Are you ready to unleash the devilish charm of the cutest cats around? Introducing GatoDiablo, a collection of feline mischief created by the talented team at Toonverse Studios and the creative mind of the artist Keith 'GIP' Miller. These cats may look innocent at first glance, but don't be fooled! Each GatoDiablo contains a unique devilish twist that only the lucky owners will discover. This collection is based on the original Toonverse DevilCatz design and was created at the request of the community. Special deals were given to DevilCatz holders and stakers, while a public mint was also available.",
