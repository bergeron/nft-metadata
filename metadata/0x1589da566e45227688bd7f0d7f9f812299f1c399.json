    "description": "e9Art - welcome to wonderland\n\n\ni believe in the power of imagination. i believe in fairy tales and happily-ever-afters.\n\nand most importantly of all, i believe in impossible things.\n\nthis hasn’t always been the case. to quote Lewis Carroll: “When I used to read fairy tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!” \n\nyes, it’s true. i’ve swallowed the red pill. \n\ni’ve fallen through the rabbit hole and landed in wonderland … and it doesn’t stop there. \n\nthe adventure has only just begun …\n\ndigital art by e9Art using disco diffusion and photoshop, May 2022\n",
