    "description": "No preview monitor to guide me, just the knowledge of how this film would react to the first light on the fence and Marram grasses. As the light broke behind me and the warm light started to bathe the scene before me I was in shoot mode. I live for mornings like these. \nI metered for the light, checked focus and continued shooting. \nOne of those mornings where I knew something special would happen.\nBantham, Devon. UK.",
