How sometimes things happen so naturally, yet so perfectly and sublimely?\n\nThis is one of those moments which I got to gracefully experience through my camera’s viewfinder while snapping this amazing pair of giraffes.\n\nFrom the lovely patterns, the elegant details and texture, the fur and the rare presence of these beautiful, tall creatures, you can’t help but gaze in awe.",
