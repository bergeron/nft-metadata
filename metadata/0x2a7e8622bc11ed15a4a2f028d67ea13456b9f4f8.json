    "description": "This family of pumas resides on the vast steppes of Patagonia, near the edge of Torres Del Paine. The family consists of a mother named Petaca (center), her son Paine (right), and her daughter Amarga (left). The two cubs have reached an age where it is time for them to leave their home. This may have been one of the last occasions when the three of them were together.\n\nI had encountered Amarga alone the day before. Her mother had left her two days prior, expecting her to fend for herself. Amarga, however, was not prepared and appeared quite distraught. She had remained in the same spot where her mother left her, continuously calling out for her return. On this particular day, though, she had been reunited with her family. They sat together on a hilltop, observing the guanaco in the valleys surrounding them, searching for an opportunity to hunt.\n\nThis photograph, titled 'Familia-Familiar,' captures a the relaxed nature of this family after they accepted my presence. I spent the next hour working around them, capturing their individual behaviors and relationships. ",
