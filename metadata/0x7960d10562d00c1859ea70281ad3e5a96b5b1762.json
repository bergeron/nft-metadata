    "name": "Emptiness",
    "description": "The juxtaposition of emptiness is a concept I’d never explored until I found myself alone on a beach, thousands of miles away from everyone I cared about. An empty coastline with no one around as far as the eye can see. On the outside, it looks enticing, beautiful, pristine even. There’s an overwhelming distraction of beauty that, for a split second, makes you forget about everything else. On the inside, it’s a void that feels as though it can never be filled. But one thing is for sure, the emptiness is temporary, as with everything in life. Time is the only constant.",
