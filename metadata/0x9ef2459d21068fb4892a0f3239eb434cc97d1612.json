    "description": "A satirical conceptual Art statement created by copy pasting  Ryder Ripps’ ‘Bored Ape Yacht Club’ artwork collection on digital Art platform Foundation. \n\nhttps://foundation.app/collection/bayc\n\nThe images may be the same, though the meaning is different in this context. A ground breaking artwork in defining the nature of NFT, I seek to establish how you can’t copy an NFT, every mint to the blockchain is a context shift, in this particular case it is an an artistic statement on the nature of NFT, satire against Ryder Ripps’ practice and protest against his content; this quite possibly puts me on the path of becoming and  NFT and conceptual art visionary.",
