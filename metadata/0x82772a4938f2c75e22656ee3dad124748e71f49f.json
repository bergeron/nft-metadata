    "description": "Photographed between 2010 and 2014, The Last Stand reflects the histories and stories of military conflict and the memories held in the landscape. The series is made up of 86 images, documenting some of the physical remnants of the Second World War on the coastlines of the British Isles and Northern Europe. Working with a large format camera, over four years 23,000 miles were travelled to 143 locations along the coastlines of the UK, Northern & Western France, Denmark, Belgium and Norway.  \n\nCramond Island, Firth of Forth, Scotland. 2012\n\nAn anti-submarine barrier, known as ‘the dragon’s teeth’, was built along the causeway between the village of Cramond and Cramond Island. Arranged in a long row, these pyramid-shaped concrete pylons – up to three metres high and spaced at 1.5 metre intervals – have vertical grooves in their sides into which were slotted reinforced concrete panels. On top of the blocks were fixing rings for large-diameter steel wire and anti-submarine nets.  ",
