    "description": "Portraits, which began as a record of existence, a boast of visuals, and a symbol of power, have long been considered to be good if they are realistically drawn and vividly drawn.\n\nOn the other hand, the way portraits should be has changed greatly due to the change of the times. Selfies and group photos are taken, but the important face is hidden by processing, and the changed ones are known all over the world through SNS.\n\nThis project aims to express them in a more natural way instead of special techniques such as face eraser stamps. The broken glass of the smartphone and the LCD protective sheet are used to diffuse the light, and the halation hides their faces.\n\nAt first glance, this photo does not seem to function as a portrait, but there may be a desire to act as a different personality and expectations for a new self.\n\nIn addition, by hiding the part that tends to have preconceptions such as facial features and expressions, in a sense, it may lead to proving your true self.",
