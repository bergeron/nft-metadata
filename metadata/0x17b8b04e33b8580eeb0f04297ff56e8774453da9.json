    "description": "Creating my first NFT artwork on foundation.app was a pivotal moment for me. It allowed me to discover the immense potential of NFT technology and new opportunities for creativity and selling works. This experience was both challenging and inspiring as I explored new technologies and ways of creating.\n\nThe artwork represents a new beginning for me as I embark on a journey where NFT technology becomes integral to my creative process. As Jean Racine once said, \"One without music in their soul, who isn't moved by sweet harmonies, is capable of theft, betrayal, and deceit; dark as night, their movements and emotions are all.\" I hope to create works that inspire and touch the souls of others.\n\nCreating my first NFT artwork has been transformative, opening new doors for me. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this new era of art and technology and look forward to sharing my creativity with the world.",
