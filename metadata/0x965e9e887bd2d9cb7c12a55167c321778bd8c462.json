    "description": "Based on the oil painting \"Rocket Pop\". \"Remastered\" is a collection of digitally manifested works inspired by psychedelic mandalas and purely created from Alex Garant's original painting images. Keeping the spirit of her analog works, these pieces are meant to push the idea of figurative OP art while whimsically reorganizing visual elements.",
