    "description": "Title : Blue Eyes&Cigarette\n\n\nThis work is a projection of me, who was sensitive and tired when there was a depressing event.\n\nSo there is the word 'Blue' in the name and work,\nI tried to express the feeling of wanting to smoke when it was so hard.\nAlso, the character in the work is a character inspired by the painter I love, Vincent Van Gogh,\nThat's why her hair is also red, and if you look closely, she has a perforated tattoo on her ear.\n\nI hope that my work will provide a little comfort to those who are depressed when they are having a hard time.\n\nCreated by Vinxent  30 / 04 / 2022\n\nThe collector will get\n the original PNG file in 1636 * 2334 pixel.\n",
