    "description": "I wanted to shoot the highest Shkhara mountain in Georgia but due to bad weather, I ended up only photographing the Shkhara clouds. Features of the Svaneti region are that it's beautiful facing any direction even without the mountain present. I didn't think much about this photo when I captured it in 2016, and never shared it publically. It took a few years for me to be able to see things in this landscape that make this photograph special in my collection.",
