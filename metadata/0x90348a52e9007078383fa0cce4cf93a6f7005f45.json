Operated by the Roundabout Theatre Company, Studio 54 has 1,006 seats on two levels.\n\nIf I had a time machine, it would definitely be in my top 10 places to visit.\n\n“The key of the success of Studio 54 is that it's a dictatorship at the door and a democracy on the dance floor.” Andy Warhol\n\nNeural Machine Tribute Collection\n\nBy Hackerman",
