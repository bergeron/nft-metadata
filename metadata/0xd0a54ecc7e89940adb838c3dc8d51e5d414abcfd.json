    "description": "Hide-And-Seek  \n \nChamp de Mars (2018)  \n \nSnowing might be the one weather phenomenon that remains quite the rarity in Paris. So when in actually snows in Paris, the French capital is blanketed in a picturesque white winter wonderland, making its streets and monuments even more magical than usual.  \n \nThis photo belongs to the ‘Four Seasons’ collection, embracing my love affair with the capital city throughout the four seasons of the year. It is one of the four photos that represents the Winter season in Paris, marked by its stark contrasts and dramatic bleakness. \n \nEdition of 10.",
