    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n\nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n“Thinkin Bout U” is our 10th release this year. Made in a hotel room on Maui, specifically to transport you to a boat party immediately upon listening. The best way to rinse this banger is by hopping on the nearest catamaran at sunset and pressing “repeat one,” but if not, we hope we take you there with this track. If you boat-test this song and are unsatisfied with the product, your money back is guaranteed ;)\n\nNext single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.",
