    "description": "Meet “Rayn”. An archer from Fluore city.\n\nShe’s the leader of Marksman clan. She’s quiet and reserved, but once it comes to the things that she believed in, she’s always gonna be the first one to fight.\n\nShe has a twin brother called Qayn. Qayn is now imprisoned for committing a crime in Lumina city. Aside from leading the Marksman clan, she’s constructing a plan to free Qayn out of prison.\n\nShe doesn’t believe in politics or government. She believes that everyone should have the equal freedom and opportunities.\n\n“The government is corrupt. They’re limiting our freedom in the name of “harmony and safety” for their own advantages while we suffer and burn down here!”",
