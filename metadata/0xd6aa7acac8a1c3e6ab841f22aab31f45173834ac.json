    "description": "Timeless yet everchanging, dunes are a fascinating metaphor to me as an artist. As artists, we have timeless energies lying underneath determining our urge to create and shape something meaningful to us. How we express ourselves however, changes with time, is everchanging. It is never compared with a finished piece, but rather a flow state and an eternal process that represents our current visions and emotions. It is a capture of the moment. The current state. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nThis is where I stand now.",
