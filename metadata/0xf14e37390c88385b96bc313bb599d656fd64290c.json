    "name": "A Tuareg Vision of Grace and Intensity",
    "description": "Taken in Mali, January 2009, at the Festival of the Desert in Essakane, 80kms North of Timbuktu.\n\nWondering through the white sand dunes I met this striking Tuareg man, leading his camel towards a dune summit where other members of his tribe congregated. The shimmering metallic 'tagelmust' that clothed him and protected his skin from the blistering heat and abrasive sands appeared the perfect visual foil when set against such piercing eyes.\n\nA high resolution TIF file will be provided to the buyer.\n\n",
