    "description": "When Mauna Loa last erupted it was 39 years ago. This image captures the Ash Plume with steam that was sent 1000ft in the air.  Making this image extremely rare. The magnitude it took for this to happen was very worrying. The area in back of this image is populated.  With thousands breathing hazardous air it was impossible to know what was next. \n\nVolcanic activity was nowhere near done, and the ashes did subside. The vog int the air did not subside, but got worse for neighboring areas. \n\nLegendary Image was taken at dusk upon nightfall. People were speechless to see this giant eruption glowing from miles away. Images taken from space shows how explosive this eruption was and why images will last lifetimes to come. \n\nJMV",
