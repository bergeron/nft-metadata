    "description": "The meander, an ancient ornament possibly inspired by the sinuous shape of river meanders, finds its place in this photograph captured in a remote location at Uvac River in Serbia's national park. Preserving the profound perspective of the valley in a photograph proves exceedingly challenging. Therefore, the artist works with various dynamic elements: light, clouds, the serene water's surface, and the shadows cast by the slopes. Describing the photograph, Roman Bevzenko acknowledges his setback: \"Unfortunately, I missed the ideal lighting conditions when the low sun accentuates the relief of the landscape.\" Frequently, mistakes unveil new avenues for experimentation, and this photo exemplifies that perfectly.\n\n[If you purchase the NFT, kindly fill out this form to provide your information.](https://forms.gle/u3pKPinstj1kHQ4d8) This will help to keep track of generous supporters, ensure proper recognition and send you a certificate of authenticity.
