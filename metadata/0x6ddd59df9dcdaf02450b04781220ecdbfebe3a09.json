    "description": "This is my favorite spot in Grand Teton National Park. Over the years it has gotten a lot more crowded but I still remember the days when I was only one of a couple people there on a fall morning. I thought I might stop going for sunrise as the crowds grew, but realized you cannot just let go of a favorite spot. It lives inside you and you have to return year after year. \n\nI will always shoot from here and spend one morning here on each trip. Every photograph is so different and captures a new piece of the scene that the previous ones didn't. This was definitely one of those shots. Pre-dawn with a stunning blue hour and perfect stillness and reflections that I captured with a long-exposure shot about a half hour before sunrise.",
