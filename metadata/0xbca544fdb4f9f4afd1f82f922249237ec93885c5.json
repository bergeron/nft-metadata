    "description": "This is the third picture of the series SIDEVIEW from Marc Fischer. \n\nIn his SIDEVIEW series, Marc has not simply photographed buildings, but through his own composition of details and perspectives, he has found new ways of looking at the buildings and depicted them in a way that they would not otherwise be seen. The focus is on minimalism, strong shadows and symmetry. ",
