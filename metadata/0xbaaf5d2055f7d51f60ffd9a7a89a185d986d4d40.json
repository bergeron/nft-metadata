The image was processed over a couple of hours to give a look and feel of being sketched by hand (which partially is). Four versions were created with different background colors to match the BMW M Power logo and a GIF was created for viewing pleasure. \n\nA full description of this NFT can be found here: [https://abromphoto.com/nft](https://abromphoto.com/nft)",
