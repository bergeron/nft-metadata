    "description": "A magical fox appeared to me in a dream and asked me to follow her. I did. She showed me a stone with an eye carved on it and pushed me to look inside. I woke up. \n\n'Kitsune' (fox) in the Edo period represents a 'witch animal'; a messenger that possesses paranormal abilities. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is.\n ",
