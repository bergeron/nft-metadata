    "description": "With \"Merge Bubble\", the two soap bubbles that mirror reality but are in a foreign world, photo artist André Wagner has created a looping work that specifically references the historical moment we are currently experiencing.  \nLike the Ethereum merge with the switch Proof of Work to Proof of State, the two bubbles are coming towards each other. What's next?  \nAs version2, the work \"Merge Bubble\" is the logical continuation of the artistic process of André Wagner, who had exhibited the NFT \"Bubble of Reality\" at Photo Basel Fair 2021 and sold it for 0.93 ETH immediately on the first day. A contemporary video work that is able to express the current fusion in an abstract but emotive way and in a unique form.",
