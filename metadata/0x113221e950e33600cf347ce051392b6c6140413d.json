    "description": "\"The Blue Moon: A Melody\"  \n2023  \n1/1\n\n2300 × 4154px at 300dpi.\n\nMy genesis artwork on Ethereum.\n\nA piece inspired by the spiritual meaning behind the latest full moon, unveiled at the \"LOVE IS LOUDER\" exhibition at Ninfa HQ during Pride in Milan.\n\nIt's time to embrace our individuality, eccentricities and imperfections. We should reflect on times in our lives when we have surprised ourselves with our own strength and inner intuition.\n\nWe should feel nourished by our own sense of self, our inner beauty and uniqueness should shine through as we are deserving of love and inner peace.\n\nFrom my galaxy to yours, \n\nLucy",
