    "description": "Water has always played  a very spiritual role in our existence as human beings. The beach has always been a place of solace for me, and anytime I have faced challenges away from my home town, all I longed for was having a moment at the shore of the beach, to let it all out. I created this piece this December as I found myself in a  position of grief and all I longed for was this moment captured in this portrait, standing in front of the beach, wanting to drawn my sorrows, my tears which would just be a very tiny drop of water compared to the vastness standing Infront of me. A reminder that I can always bring my problems to the ocean and they will be swept away. \n\nThis is a self portrait that was taken in assistant with my friend Marcus.  \nAll Collectors will get an extra Airdrop from this series.",
