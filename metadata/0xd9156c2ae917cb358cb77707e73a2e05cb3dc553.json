    "description": "While the \"Woke Pixels\" project embodies an extreme notion of political correctness, it is, at its core, a satirical commentary on society at large. Every element, character, and pixel has been artificially crafted with no association to any real person, product, or organization. It's a humorous mirror held up to our times, not promoting or detracting from any individual or entity, but rather encouraging reflection on the social dynamics of our rapidly evolving, interconnected world.\nNO CARBON WAS HARMED IN THE PROCESS",
