    "description": "When the pandemic started, photography took a turn for me. I couldn't follow through with some plans I had, so I turned to creating art pieces instead.\n\n\"Our passions are the true phoenixes; when the old one is burnt out, a new one rises from its ashes.\"\n- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\n\"Warped Manhattan\" is a piece that is intended to have many different meanings and was inspired by the Golden Spiral, 3D glasses, and the allure of a martini. \n\nPhotographed Sept 9 2020.\n\n",
