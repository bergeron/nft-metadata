    "description": "This is the starting point of the Only Die Once project. \n\nThe goal is to start with 22 of Japan's peaks in 2022. \n\nOn January 10, 2022 I made a solo climb to the summit of Karamatsu-dake in Nagano, Japan. The climb took 5 hours, 43 minutes, and 3 seconds, covering 9.8km and an elevation gain of 1,492m. I reached the 2,696m summit at approximately 12:30pm. The weather was a blustery -10c with wind speeds of 15m/s. It was my second time in crampons.\n\nThe above image was on the descent from the summit, about 30 minutes from the completion of the day. Since I knew I had plenty of time left to take some pictures, I stopped frequently to take some shots. The gentleman pictured near the hut absolutely smoked me on the way down, but I was ok with it. Looking at the scenery, I knew I'd have something great to work with.\n\nFighting to the summit with knee pain was a turning point for me. I knew if I could do this, I can conquer anything in my path. And I fully intend to do just that.",
