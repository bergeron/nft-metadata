    "description": "The Trek series consists of digitally altered photographs taken during my 6-day trek up Mount Kilimanjaro in July, 2011. In an effort to explore my own spirituality, I mirrored and layered these images to suggest divine-like manifestations.\n\nIn a previous life (aka before working in music for UMG), I was a Fine Arts Photographer. Other than the art itself, all images from The Trek will provide utility in the form of in-depth music strategy consultations.\n\nFeel free to ping me on Twitter for more information if needed - https://twitter.com/RaulAGuerrero",
