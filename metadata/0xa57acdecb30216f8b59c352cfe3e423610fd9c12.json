    "description": "This song was formed from the inspiration of Nipsey Hussle. He was one of the most impactful independent hip hop artist in my time. Prior to his death he wanted to create a documentary about Dr. Sebi. During an interview promoting this documentary Nipsey Hussle stated that if he were to die prior to the release or completion of the film that he wanted us to ride for him. Nipsey believing that an untimely death pointed back to the same conspirators behind Dr. Sebi’s death and Left Eye from TLC death, located while she was healing with Dr. Sebi, being one of the same and that it’s time for us to make a stand!",
