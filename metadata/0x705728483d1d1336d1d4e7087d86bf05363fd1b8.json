    "description": "When you play by someone else's rules, it's easy to feel like you're not in control. You can't win by playing by someone else's rules or clearly following the rules of the game. You have to set your own rules, use your wits, and think outside the box. Only then will the game be interesting, unpredictable, and exciting.\n\nDigital Art\n\n3d+2d+OpenAI\n_____________________\n\nAnomalitKate - Ð¡reator of Anomalitism and an alternate version of the future.\n\nThe goal of Anomalitism is to show that individuality, uniqueness, and freedom from all boundaries and stereotypes are the key to creating a better world.\n\nAnomalitism is a universe in which there are a large number of elements, anomalites, at the same time. Each of them is a unique entity. Together they represent a Picture of the World, the space in which all elements exist. Each element exists independently in space, has the ability to communicate and complement other elements.\n\n\n",
