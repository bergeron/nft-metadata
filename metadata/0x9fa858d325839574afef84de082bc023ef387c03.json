    "description": "Creativity once flowed like a river,\nBut now it struggles to deliver.\nFor technology has taken hold,\nAnd left our imaginations cold.\n\nThe screen, a captivating foe,\nHas stunted what we used to know.\nOur thoughts and feelings now suppressed,\nAs our devices keep us obsessed.\n\nWe need to break this digital chain,\nAnd let our minds roam free again.\nFor only then can we reclaim,\nThe creativity that we once proclaimed.\n\nSo put down that phone, switch off that screen,\nAnd let your creative spirit be seen.\nFor in this world, we must strive,\nTo keep imagination alive.",
