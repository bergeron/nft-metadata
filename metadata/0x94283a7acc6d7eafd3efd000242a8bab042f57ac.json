    "description": "1/1 minted by Mad Monk, Akumu, 2022\n\nMad Monk's dark Japanese themed artwork and study of reimagined traditional characters have led to the creation of Akumu in November 2022. Deployed first on Manifold and AI assisted, Akumu (\"Nightmares\") is a collection of demons, deities, monsters, fighters and darker themes. Following initial mints on its own smart contract, Akumu will be minted on other platforms in order to reach you, haunt you and possibly torment you. Beware of your nightmares before they come true.",
