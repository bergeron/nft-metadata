    "description": "**Eclipse Records** is an American record label developing some of the best hard rock & heavy metal artists worldwide. This pre-genesis NFT collection is reserved for members of the Eclipse Records Team. **The 1997 logo** is the first iteration of the Eclipse Records logo. Also known as \"the xi8 logo\", it was designed in 1997 by label president Chris Poland. He superimposed multiple iterations of the letter \"R\" in various rotations, then merged the paths with the letters \"x, \"i\", and the number \"8\".
