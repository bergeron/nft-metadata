    "description": "I saw the beasts that prowl the dunes,  \nThe serpents that coil in the heat,  \nThe lizards that dart through the dust,  \nAnd I was filled with wonder.\n\nI heard of the great sandstorm,  \nThat can bury a man alive,  \nAnd of the wandering oasis,  \nThat is the only refuge from the heat.\n\nFor the first time, I saw life  \nAll around me in the sand;  \nThe scaly, the clawed, the fanged,  \nAll working together to survive.\n\nAnd in that moment, I understood  \nWhy they call it the land of the dead;  \nFor in the desert, life is a battle,  \nAnd only the strong survive.",
