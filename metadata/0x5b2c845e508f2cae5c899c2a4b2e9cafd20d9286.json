    "description": "Goblin habitat of the one unique and brave race. They live on Islands, in forests with high trees, in small houses arcane style.\n\nAll members of the same tribe are covered in moss made of bark to be more camouflaged but they aren't afraid to show themselves when needed. This particular race found it could be more rewarding, in the long run at least, to serve good rather than to serve evil.\n\nDespite their generally poor reputation however, not all goblins are dim-witted or evil. Some goblins have risen to become heroes, gaining enough renown to be accepted into the civilized world.\n\nCreated using AI technology, 3D Software and Photoshop.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
