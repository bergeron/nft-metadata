    "description": "Shikaras of Kashmir is a unique collection of 15 photographs of Shikara boats shot by Saahil Rahman in 2018 - 2021. They are a cultural symbol of Kashmir in India and have been an integral element of the society since pre-independence times. Some are used for fishing, harvesting aquatic vegetation (usually for fodder) and transport while most are used for tourism after being covered with tarpaulins. \n\nHaving a Shikara of Kashmir NFT grants you 100% creative and commercial rights over this work. \n\nLocation: Kashmir, India (2018)\nShot on: Sony A7III ",
