    "description": "The genesis piece is a perfect one meter diameter white sphere, 3d modeled and rendered by the artist. The sphere is intentional, being the only geometric figure with all its points equally distanced from the center. No colors where used either only white and gray. Everyday the genesis piece will be subdued to a variant a.k.a a mutation. \n\nAfter the first mutation there is no human modification towards the art, thus the motto of the project “Everyday less human”.  \n\n The possibilities? Endless.",
