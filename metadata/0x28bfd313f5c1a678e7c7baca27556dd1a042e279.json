The artist Arseneca has created a link between the tangible and intangible world. The NFT contains the geographical coordinates from where the pavement is located to the bottom of the water, and the Unix time of the moment.  \n An emochain is like a vibrating rope between the two worlds. \n The reflection in the NFT reveals the moment when the emochain was created \n\n𝐴𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑎 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ  underground 𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑠𝑡 𝑤ℎ𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑠.
