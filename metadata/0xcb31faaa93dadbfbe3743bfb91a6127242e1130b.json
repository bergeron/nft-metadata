    "description": "Year 2077, a group of people in the world that they call “Metaverse” completely changes the ecosystem. The foundations of this change were laid about 70 years ago and it was now fully bearing its fruit.\n\nCharon became a servant of the \"Metaverse\" group and was paid to bring dead souls through the \"Endless River\". It was impossible for souls that were not buried to cross the swamp of the river. For this reason, an obolos (penny) was placed in the mouths or eyes of the dead.\n\nThe cruel boatman, Charon, expelled the souls who could not pay the price and would never soften. Unburied souls hovered in the air for a hundred years.\n\n“This legendary narrative has been so effective that the Greeks have adopted the custom of putting the dead in the tomb along with the depiction of the cave rituals in the early periods of Christianity. The Greeks have traditionally put 10-15 coins in a bowl called \"gift money\" with the dead.”",
