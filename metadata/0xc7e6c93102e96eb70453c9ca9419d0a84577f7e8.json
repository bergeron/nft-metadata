    "description": "This montage is made of shots taken at Kaytranada's sold out show in Montreal after releasing his acclaimed debut LP 99.9%.   \n\nThis album and the 99.9% tour established Kaytranada in the music industry as a recognized producer and landed him a major record deal with RCA records. \n\nThe 99.9% tour and album made all the more impressive given the diversity of samples, guests and timeless hit tracks like “Glowed Up” and “Got it Good”\n\n(Photography and Design by Sean Vadaru)",
