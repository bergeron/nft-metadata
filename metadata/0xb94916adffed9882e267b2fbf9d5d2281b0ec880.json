    "description": "\"Don't Take Your Love\" was released on May 22, 2020, roughly two months after \"15 days to slow the spread\". It was my last release of 2020 and my final solo/pop track before fully entering the EDM space in 2021. \n\nThe song first came to life while I was messing with a vocal plugin I recently purchased and experimenting with stacking a lot of vocals together to make a choir/gang vocal. The line that started that experiment was, \"No, don't take your love from me.\" \n\nThe lyrics were inspired by a relationship on the verge of collapse, and the feelings of experiencing someone's love slowly fade. It's interesting and kind of poetic, though, that the song lyrics are beautifully and tragically paralleled with the love of the world gradually being replaced by fear. So I'd say \"Don't Take Your Love\" is also a song about the desperate plea to not lose love in the world during one of the most extraordinary times of our lives. \n\n\"Don't Take Your Love\" is one of the few songs in my career that is 100% written, recorded, produced, mixed, and mastered entirely by myself. This style of song is the kind of music I want to return to making in the future. \n\nThis Music NFT release with Sound is a brand new endeavor for me in the Web3 space, so a massive thank you to them for reaching out and another huge thank you to everyone who mints this song. \n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, it really does mean the world to me when anyone finds a connection with something I've created. \n\nMuch Love and God bless, \n\nZack Gray",
