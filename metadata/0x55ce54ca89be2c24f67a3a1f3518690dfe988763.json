    "description": "'After Dark'\n\nA woman reaching for a box, photographed through a fogged up window pane. The colors of her clothes harmonizing with the reflections on the glass. In the back of the room three people in conversation, their forms outlined perfectly by a spotlight on the wall.  \n\nJust a few moments sooner or later and the essence of this scene would have changed. The reflections obstructed, the woman in a different light and the people's silhouettes broken up.\n\nI have chosen this photograph as the first piece in my collection because it so aptly exemplifies the transient nature of beauty shining through the mundanity of everyday life.\n\n5223x2938px, jpeg\n\n[Licensed under NFTuL 1.0](https://nft-license.org/)",
