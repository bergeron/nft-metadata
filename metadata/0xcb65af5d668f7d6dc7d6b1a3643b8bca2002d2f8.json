    "description": "It doesn’t matter for what reason I’ve left home. It doesn’t matter where I’ve come from and where I’m going. What matter is that I’m on a street or another public area .\nStreets are full of mysteries. Full of life, the real life. Sometimes the street is just like a movie. The scene and the light are ready and people are acting their roles. But it’s a movie over which I have no control nor directorial role in and its actors do whatever they want. The only thing needed is to be just a little curious so that I can see interesting moments of this movie and also keep a record of them through my camera. I just have to get close and wait… Wait for a frame of this movie which is unknown to me and I don’t even know the actor. The only thing I do is observe and wait for a frame of this movie when everything falls into sudden arrangement. The scene has already been decorated, the light is on and my unknown actor is in his place. In this moment the only thing I do is taking pictures.\nThese photos",
