    "description": "I'm watching a night sky Fade into darker hues of blue And I can't help but wonder Do you see what I see ? City lights off and on Sidewalks twisting and turning Can you hear busy . cars ? Opening and closing doors ? Take a seat next to me And watch tonight's dreams Fall like shooting stars Into your loving mind Close your eyes if need be I'll hold you tight tonight",
