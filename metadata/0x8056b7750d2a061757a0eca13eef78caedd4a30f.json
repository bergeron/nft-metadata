    "description": "“Minted” is the third music NFT in the hume NFT ecosystem. These 50 limited edition tokens will grant you a spot on the allowlist for the Hume Genesis and are also the third ever music NFT from hume metastar, and the world’s most famous Fluf, angelbaby. This is the first hume music NFT featuring the artist BrandYn and is inspired by the ethos of the Quirkies community. \r\n\r\n In the name of building an open and creative metaverse, angelbaby and the hume collective invited Quirkies from across the metaverse to appear on the cover art. Hume collective members and Quirkies holders joined together to choose which Quirkie would be featured on the cover art with angelbaby. Quirkie #478 was chosen during a token gated hume collective decision. \r\n\r\n  we are hume. we are many. wearehume.com",
