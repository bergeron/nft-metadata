    "name": "Cries Of The Ocean",
    "description": "From above the ocean looks like a beautiful and peaceful place. With the clear blue waters, the excited waves, and alluring life, we don't look beyond the surface. We don't hear the cries and we don't see the discomfort of the marine life. We only see what our eyes want to see.\n\nLook beyond the sparkling water and crashing waves, and what would you see? Everyday, marine life faces threats because of our little bits of plastic.\n\nThis photograph represents the agony of the marine life and how they navigate the ocean despite the heavy plastic debris.",
