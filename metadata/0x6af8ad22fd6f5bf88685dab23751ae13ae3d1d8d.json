    "description": "Elle #1” confronts a graceful and nonchalant hand, perhaps belonging to a model, a hand in representation. Slightly concealed in the image, melted into other graphic material, there is another hand, maybe the hand of the artist, at least that’s what we guess when looking at the xeroxed fingers, which are beautiful and at the same time worn, artists fingers. Creation vs representation. What do you choose?",
