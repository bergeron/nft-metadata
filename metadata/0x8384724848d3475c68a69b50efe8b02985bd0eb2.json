    "description": "It was a usual habit of mine to visit the paddy field before I get the job and shifted from my hometown. There in the middle of the fields are two coconut trees, sitting detached from its surroundings. It was always scary to walk towards that place. What a beauty and mystery it is to see those coconut trees from a long distance. Sitting afar from that place, my mind will began to weave a lot of surreal things.\n      The curled up sleeping Jackals, a creature like rhinoceros beetle  those skin resembles the dried outer shell of coconut with blackest of the black color and a height to touch the sky, the flying away group of cattle egrets above those, a house near the coconut trees bearing signature of the forgone years, from a far I see a girl by the house, wind tenderly caressing her tresses, waiting with her confession of love for meâ€¦\n\nDescription\n\nCreated by Rejin V R\nDigital drawing\n7000 x 4000 pixels\n",
