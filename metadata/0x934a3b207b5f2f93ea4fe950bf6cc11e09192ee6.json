    "description": "This 1/1edition stands alone.\n\nAs lava pours into the ocean, I sat in awe of such elements finally meeting for another epic battle.  \nAs the fight between Pele (Fire Goddess) & Namakaokaha'i (Water Goddess, Pele's sister) began, I had a front row seat. These battles over the ages are what shapes the land and creates the stories that I have found myself chasing all my life.  \nIn this moment I could feel the searing heat on my face and the coolness of the salty steam that covered everything. It was such a dance on my skin and my senses, and I couldn't help but stare into the light, feeling so connected to a land that I have only dreamed about. When I look at the hundreds and even thousands of images I took during this event, this one image of creation truly stands out; and I now understand why the moth is so attracted to the light, and is finally doomed by that glow. Much like most lovers that Pele took, none were lucky enough to escape with their lives.  \nI will forever be a moth!",
