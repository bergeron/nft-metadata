    "description": "Mixed technique using fire on paper print.\n\nPortrait of Mustapha, the man responsible for water distribution in the oasis. January 2021 Tighmert, Morocco.\n\nIn this oasis, water is considered as a precious heritage. Each family has their own share of water that they inherited from their ancestors who at the time had built the irrigation network of the oasis. There are only a few people like Mustapha to master the calendar of water distribution as well as the quota for each of the inhabitants. \nThe repeated droughts that affected the region in recent years have greatly reduced the water table and dried up the oasis, which triggers more fires and undermines this ecosystem that is already vulnerable. In this picture, I physically altered the photograph using fire as a metaphor of this degradation.\n\nEdition: 1/1 \nYear: 2021 \nFormat: JPG, 3500 × 2688 pixels",
