    "name": "The butterfly effect",
    "description": "The butterfly effect or the 'chaos theory' as it is coined as, is the sensitive dependence of initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. It's usually depicted as a catastrophic analogy with the weather systems but what if, philosophically, it was more of a positive cause and effect theory of daily life? Small moments of impact that go a really long way, romanticising the chaos positively.",
