    "description": "Distorted Reality is a collection of images that were shot over a decade of travel in India. These images were destroyed in an unfortunate incident that crashed my hard drive causing the insufferable hurt of losing all my work.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the images were lost and some that were recovered were distorted in a weird but intriguing way. It felt that these images had undergone a cosmic overhaul, reincarnated into a reality that’s neither in the past nor in the present.\n\nThese have since become prized processions and always remained close to my heart. So, here is what I call ‘Rebirth’ reminding us of the distorted reality of the world we live in.",
