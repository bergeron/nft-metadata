    "description": "“Holy Bitcoin!” Is a nod from Romero Britto to all the new digital currencies and their place in pop-culture. Inspired by the nature of Bitcoin and its constant fluctuating value, Romero places the coin in the middle of the art, as if it was about the land after a coin toss, but the wings pick up the wind from under it so it doesn’t reach the surface, symbolizing its constant shift on the market curve. On the music, Paul Blair adds, \"I wanted to make it feel kind of anxious and opulent. The 80s and synthesizers came to mind and the cash machine rolling around and the bitcoin coming in and leaving.\"",
