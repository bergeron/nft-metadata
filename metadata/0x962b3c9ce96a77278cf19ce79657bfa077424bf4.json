I love being there. \n\nThis was the last outing for my acrylic dome port because I fell off a breakwater climbing down into the water and scratched the hell out of it.  Jiorgi had to drive me to a CVS afterwards due to a shocking amount of bleeding I was experiencing from contact with the barnacles on the breakwater during my tumble.\n\nImage details below:\n-Created 07/28/2018 in Miami, FL\n-Shot on Nikon d850 with Nikkor 16-35 inside of a\nNauticam housing with a 180mm acrylic dome port\n-4000px long edge\n\nMore about this collection [Here](https://damonloblephotography.com/they-went-overboard)\n\nMy most up to date images are always on my [Insta](https://instagram.com/damonloble) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/olnikkormat)",
