    "description": "She is paralized, crystallized in that endless second. She was going through her whole life clueless, like driving a car with only a steering wheel, but no brake or reverse gear. No navigation system, no map. Continuously forced to drive through the world in this vehicle, but the world is covered in a blinding fog. She hoped that in some directions the fog will clear, but it never did. It never will. There are distant moons in her eyes, the desire and dread of an action. Anxiety of possibility in existence. Endless variations of her life after the moment of decision. Almost like fractions of it could be already seen in the face. But she hesitate as if her whole life is dependant on this one little decision. And it is. Always has been. On every decision. Every second.\n\nCollage, hand drawing.\nâ€”â€”\nðŸ–¼ 4000x5000\nâ€”â€”\n2 0 2 3",
