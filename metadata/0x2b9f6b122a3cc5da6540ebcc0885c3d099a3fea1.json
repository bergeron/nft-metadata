    "description": "This is the first piece I chose to mint as an NFT. It's all been quite an experiment. I had a wonderful evening shooting with Jess. We created maybe a dozen images together. Some of which may end up here. But this is the first. \nShe is defiant in her gaze, despite the darkness that surrounds her. \nThis plate was shot with a Speed Graphic 4x5 with a 135mm lens. In studio, with 9600 watt seconds of strobe. ",
