    "description": "This is the first image I took with the drone and the one that inspired me to do the 2thirds series, aptly titled Fall. When a photographer holds a camera to his eyes he/she uses the rule of two thirds for composition. Mechanically I used this rule although the camera was 400 feet away up in the air when composing a simple road, a gradient green grass and a fence, road tripping through Oklahoma when driving to visit my daughterâ€™s university.\nAn ordinary everyday sight takes a new dimension through the eyes of a bird.\n\nColcord, Oklahoma | 2017\n2891 x 3857 px",
