    "description": "In this piece titled «EVERYTHING THAT LIVES», I depicted how people are burning down rainforests for land or food. \n\nRainforests are the lungs of our planet. More than 340 million hectares of natural areas are damaged by fire every year, and humans are involved in all of it. \n\nThe train in this NFT is an image of human technology invading the natural ecosystem. It is sad to realize how much beauty we have lost.",
