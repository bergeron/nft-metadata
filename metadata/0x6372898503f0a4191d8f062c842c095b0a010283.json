    "description": "Subject of the artwork Seventy Million is WW2. The war that took place in recent past, created a big breaking point in our world. Starting on September 1, 1939, the war ended on September 2, 1945. In the war, nearly 70 million of people lost their lives. So, who’s the winner of a war that caused millions of people’s death? The losing party is quite obvious. People. The name of the artwork refers to the number of people that passed away. Frame of the artwork is in golden colour and it involves the flags of some of the warring countries. It also has some depictions of war guns and soldiers. When we look inside the shiny golden frame, we can see that there are 35 photos telling the anguish, sorrow, brutality and the devastating face of the war. Each picture has a story. Stories of some of the photos:\n•Alan Turing’s decipher of the code of Enigma, let the war end presumably 2 years earlier and saved the lives of 14 million people.\n•The image occured right after the bombing of Hiroshima.",
