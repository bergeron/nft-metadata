    "description": "Acrylic on Canvas Painting\n160x160cm\n2009 \n6400x6400 px\n\nThe work could echo the environment of absolute rule and subjugation, a trauma experienced by the artist, but the conclusions drawn from this are uncertain. The painting is poised, promising no more than it can deliver and proud of its own sobriety, but otherwise obscure, hinting at interpretation rather than denial of any narrative. Whilst not disavowing doubt, neither does the artist advance clarity or certainty, leaving indeterminacy, ambivalence and obscurity as his defining features: narrative content remains concealed and the work becomes a riddle.\nBut if the work is to endure, it must always provoke fresh attempts to read its narrative, even if that narrative remains unsolvable. As long as it is clear that the work contains meaning, no matter how incomprehensible, it will yield expressive force and continue to stimulate the viewer.",
