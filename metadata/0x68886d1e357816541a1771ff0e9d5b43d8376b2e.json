    "description": "As a kid, I loved watching cartoon series like Sesame Street, Ruggrats, Scooby-Doo, Ed, Ed and Eddie, Samurai Jack, Adventure Time, etc. Things looked simpler back then, when we weren't hunkering down, losing our jobs, or experiencing relationship problems. I've learned that it's a natural inclination to feel nostalgic in times of tragedy and excessive stress, and to rely on those sentiments for comfort, a sense of normalcy, and protection. I find comfort in old cartoons as an adult, it serves as a source of inspiration for my art and anytime I feel stressed or down they give this sense of comfort. I simply sit back and watch old cartoons that I have collected from friends or found online. At this point, I am in a safe space, which aids in my capacity to self-soothe during a stressful situation. As a result, I believe nostalgia acts as an emotional pacifier, assisting us in acclimating to a new reality that is harsh, unpleasant, and painful.",
