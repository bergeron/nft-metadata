    "description": "\"Nomads\" was inspired by the Bedouins, nomadic tribes from Jordan.\n\nThe nomadic Bedouins have roamed Jordan's valleys, mountains, and deserts for centuries.\n\nKnown for their incredible survivalist skills, warm hospitality, and communion with the land.\n\nToday, most Bedouins are no longer fully nomadic and live in houses in towns and villages. \n\nHowever, many maintain a traditional tent so they can still move around with the seasons in search of better grazing for their cattle.",
