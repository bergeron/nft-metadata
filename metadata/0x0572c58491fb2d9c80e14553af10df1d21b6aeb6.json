    "description": "Chicken buses are part of Guatemalan pop/street culture, we use these \"camionetas\" to travel from one place to another. Chicken buses are fun and colorful, they also have their own names, like Primorosa or San Juanera. If you travel in one of these buses, you will be listening to rancheras, reggaeton and 80s music. Each bus has their own style, inside and outside the bus. This photo was taken in 2019, when I was stuck in traffic.",
