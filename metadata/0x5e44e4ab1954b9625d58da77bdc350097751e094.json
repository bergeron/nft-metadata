    "description": "This piece was created for all those who have went through trauma. I was inspired by the stories of women out there who have gone through hell and back and in some cases men as well.  I used pinks for healing, red for love/pain, with this main character digging all the disgust out of their own eye as a form of healing. \n\nThe collage elements are pictures that I have taken in and around manhattan over the years and incorporated into my art style for effect.
