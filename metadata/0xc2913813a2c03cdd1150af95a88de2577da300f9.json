    "description": "Created - 2014 \n\nThis is one of the first digital artworks I created that would fall into the Visionary Art genre.  It was originally purposed to be a book cover for a small run of paperbacks, self-published by a 13 year old youngster.  It has since gone through a number of renditions and refinements and on to become one of my most recognizable works. ",
