    "description": "\"The body was her house and the attic her favorite place. At night you could see the light on and hear her footsteps prowling, wondering about visible reality and its ambiguity\"\n\nThe human mind is the most complex and enigmatic structure known. It contains more neurons than stars in the galaxy. It has the so-called consciousness, inaccessible to animals and unique of the human being; with it, man reflects his environment, the closest social environment, and his own inner world, capable of making everything possible. That open attic of incalculable dimensions.\n\nBright Attic is part of the “Rooms of Mind” series, a collection of self-portraits that explore the intimacy of the mind through some of its processes, such as: thought, memory, reasoning, decision-making, imagination, and perception.\n\nEach character develops within rooms of small dimensions, thus creating a dialogue with ourselves and directing us towards the resolution of a specific problem.\n",
