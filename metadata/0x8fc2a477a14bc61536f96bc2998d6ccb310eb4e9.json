    "description": "The photograph won the first prize in the international photography competition organized by the caving federation in 2021.\n\nThe person seen in the photo is 73 years old, breaking the record for the oldest person to reach this point by descending to the waterfall.\n\nThese waterfalls and travertines are on average 550 meters below the earth's surface, and in order to reach it, it is necessary to proceed on a difficult 3000-meter track starting from the entrance of Safranbolu Bulak cave.  In the cave where the ambient temperature is 15°C, the humidity is around 70%.  The water temperature of the waterfall is 8°.  This cave is accepted as Turkey's 4th longest cave in terms of its length as the last point to be visited.",
