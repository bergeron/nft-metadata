    "description": "1/1 digital art by Yulia Rossan 5000*6000 px 450 DPI\n\nI am opening my new collection, in which I will show you the wonderful world of unspoiled wild Siberian nature, with an animal that embodies the spirit of Siberia, its power, massiveness and tranquility at the same time. This is the brown bear. It is a kind, beautiful and intelligent animal. Its image reflects the strength of the Siberian people and their unwavering spirit. It is not for nothing that the bear is a symbol of masculinity and strength. \n\nThe bear was the guardian of the taiga, a sacred animal that contained\nthe wisdom of the ancestors. To kill it was a great sin, which was necessarily followed by nature's punishment.\n\nBy the way, scientists have proven that the bear in its psychology is the closest to man among wild animals.\n\nI live in a town called Bear River, so I showed it in this work as well.",
