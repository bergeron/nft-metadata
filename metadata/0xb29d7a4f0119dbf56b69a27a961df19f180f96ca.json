    "description": "'Aikebana' is an ongoing project that blends my interest in Ikebana, nature, abstract sculpture, and new technology (Ai). \n\nThrough this project, I intend to uncover novel forms that originate from nature but which have been filtered through our collective memory and finally selected and curated by myself.\n\nI believe by doing so, that I'm able to discover forms that defy categorization and almost have a soul of their own, one that exists somewhere between technology and those who control it."
