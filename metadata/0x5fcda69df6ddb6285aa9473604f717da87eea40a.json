    "description": "The first single off of Hyperpunk // Psychotic is a euphoric and edgy visual that expresses my relationship with nostalgia and the warped perspective it has on my head. A feeling of \"Things use to be so much better\" mixed with frustration for the situation I was in at the time of writing. The video was directed by myself and filmed in Marbella in Spain with my friend Nathan Sheridan and includes extra work from both Tadhg Costelloe and Josh Roxby. This is my genesis music video drop and collecting this piece will give you access to the private hi vis community group as well as access to certain real life events further down the line. The song was produced by Fionn O'Brien and Layen. If you collect on of these editions please also sing up to this link so that I can reach out to you with future utility and experiences related to this drop - https://fanpad.xyz/app/fan-registration?dpk=C3RSndRo9tg%3D",
