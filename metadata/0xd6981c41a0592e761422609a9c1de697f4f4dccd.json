Acrylic paint, pencils, and spraypaint were used to create this.\n\nWhen you look at the details, you'll notice that it's about more than just frustration. It demonstrates the existence of life beyond death; Take the questions that pop up in your head seriously.\n\nIt's YOU.\n\nEveryone has their own set of frustrations, and it is up to us to figure out how to deal with them and learn from them.",
