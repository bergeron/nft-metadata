    "description": "This self-portrait satisfies the need to define and communicate my continuous process of highly conflictual mutation that I cannot clinically escape from. Towards this end, I have sought to discover the nth visual key, a synthesis of an artistic journey that began in a period of forced classical studies during my adolescence, to then blossom into a newly found unconscious passion.\n\nAs a result of an unconscious eternal conflict between artistic and scientific subjects, my acceptance process surged through embedding the main digital production processes available today. I accept and do not repress my spasmodic, irrational need to explore and change at the expense of who I am and what I do in the present. My dissonant perception of myself within this portrait is described by a fixed gaze of awareness and my lateral dissociative nemesis that corrupts ideas and feelings too quickly.\n\n4200x4200 300dpi 4,35Mb\n3D base shape> shading and rendering> AI post-processing> digital ovepaintig",
