    "description": "This is the first track on \"Pandora's Box.\"\n\nIn the traditional version of the myth, Zeus gave Pandora a small box but said she must never open it. As Pandora was created to be curious, she eventually could not resist and opened the box. Out of the box came horrible evils such as sickness, death, poverty and sadness that were inflicted on humans.\n\nIn hindsight, using \"Pandora's Box\" to describe a relationship and the effects of it was overly dramatic, but the analogy still stands (in a mental way).\n\n\"annabelle\" was meant to be soft & made to tug at your heartstrings. Sometimes your mood can be entirely lifted by hearing someone's voice or laughter. Sometimes you find purpose after a series of interactions.",
