    "description": "“Buy into my fear, sell me on yours” is the denting, yet ludic mechanism behind the “ASYLUM” series, which includes the triptych you are viewing right now. It’s a rendition of repeated anxiety transactions – those that stimulate any relationship centered on intimacy, regardless of fortuity or longevity. \nThe erotic undertones of these three works are the result of a spontaneity which I’m hoping you, the viewer, will embrace and appropriate.\n\nFRIGHT ME FEED ME FREE ME  #1 format: 8523 x 3000 px / PNG / 23.0 MB\n\nthe NFT is backed by a COLLECTOR EDITION PRINTS SET, no. #1/10: unframed archival pigment prints on fine art paper at museum standard, 40 x 40cm, signed by the author, available for the buyer if requested. The edition consists in 3 images and is limited to 10 sets worldwide.\n\nmore details: https://alexandru-crisan.com/shop/limited-prints-sets/fright-me-feed-me-free-me/",
