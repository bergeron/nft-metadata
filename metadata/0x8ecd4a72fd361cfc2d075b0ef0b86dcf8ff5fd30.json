    "description": "Now that the darkness has covered the world and humans are making the conditions on the planet more difficult every day, things like wars, bad economic situation, global warming and many other things are ready for Sawulak (that has been sleeping for years) to wake up and take the energy of the good forces that exist in the world from them and expand its territory and plunge the world into pure darkness.  \nHe has now woken up from his cave where he has been sleeping for years because of the evil conditions in the world and he is going to set foot on his path.",
