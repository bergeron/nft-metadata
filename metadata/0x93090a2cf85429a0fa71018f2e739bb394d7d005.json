    "description": "I had a brief exchange with Herbert in April. He’d shared outputs from ‘Farbraster - 1974’ which looked similar to a project I was working on. In the post, a fellow creator A. Penne summarised this coincidence by quoting a part from ‘Century’ by C. Reas, \n\n“what they had done so far, was part and parcel of wonderfully silent conversations they had been engaged in without knowing”\n\nI like this quote but more so because my project was using Perlin noise as a base but Herbet’s project was created at least 6yrs before it was invented. I replied with a statement about the mandelbrot and how everything we know/will know already exists waiting to be discovered. \n\nHerbert’s response to that sits clearly in memory, “...if real random exists in our world! If, of course! I personally strongly believe in it, cannot prove it finally...”\n\nI chose these works as Herbert saw and appreciated them. His curiosity and passion paved the way for so many so it’s a privilege to honor his legacy like so.",
