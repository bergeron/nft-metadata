    "description": "We see the city as Travis sees it. The front windshield is a little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES. The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares. Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular - bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies - they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks and lighted storefronts. Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?\n\nExtract from 'Taxi Driver'\n\nScreenplay By Paul Schrader 1976",
