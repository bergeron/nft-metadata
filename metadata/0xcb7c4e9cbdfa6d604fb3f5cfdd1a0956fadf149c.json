    "description": "We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n\"One Step\" is the 3rd of these 24 singles. This is the most PM song we have. Built around a single vocal loop we wrote and recorded in Florence, this song proudly flies the flag of tech house - a genre that we respect and love. If you close your eyes, we hope you can feel the electricity of a 4am Italian club. Cuz we sure can.\n\nNext single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.",
