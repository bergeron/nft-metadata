    "description": "5000px x 3333px\n\nPhotograph of a balanced chair in a hotel room at the Four Seasons Philadelphia.\n\nAn expensive hotel room is nice. But after spending a lot of time in a lot of nice hotel rooms even that gets boring. Balancing a chair or any other furniture I could lift seemed like the right response.\n\nBorn out of boredom, applying a little punk and making some art, Hotel Room Mods are actual balanced pieces of furniture. There is no glue or photoshop. The items stayed in balance for mere seconds or, in a few cases, until I took them back down. The goal was always to get a photo to document it and sometimes it took multiple nights and multi-hour long sessions to get that photo.\n\nEDITION OF 1\n",
