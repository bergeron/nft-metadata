    "description": "One of my most emblematic images and the one that has taught me the most to become the artist I am today. \n\nBack in 2015 I was just getting started with wildlife photography unaware of the journey it would be and how it would shape every aspect of my life. This photo is what defined deep within myself what I was willing to endure to send out the message of our natural world. \n\nOut in northern Norway I went out to dive with whales. It was mid winter and the periods of light were short and days cold. Once you get in the water, your fingers, face and feet start to burn as the water is extremly cold. In about 2 minutes they go numb. For a whole week I went diving 3 times and saw nothing. Just extreme cold and blue emptiness. On the 4th and last attempt I was gifted with this scene. An orca commanding a symphony of fish trying to flee from her path.\n\nIt was a humbling and inspiring experience. I forgot about the cold and understood what it would take to become who I am today.
