    "description": "\"Cernnunos Sleeps \nThe Old God sleeps  \ndown in the dark, moist,  \nodorous underfoot,  \nWaiting for us  \nTo put down our roots.\"  \nfrom the poem Cernnunos Sleeps  by C. Hue Bumgarner-Kirby\n\n\nThis digital painting depicts Cernunnos appearing from a copse of trees, surrounded by animals and ancient, moss-covered stones carved with spirals. He looks back at you as a part of the scene, his eyes reflecting a green light.\n\nThe snake like forms of green energy emitted from the central stone, are representative of an ancient fertile energy and symbolise his role as a deity of fertility and abundance. The hunting raptor and the toads and mushrooms represent Cernunnos's connection to the underworld and the cycle of life and death.\n\n\nThis piece took 11hrs and 12mins to create and a year to muse on. It  celebrates the mythology and traditions of the ancient Celts.\n\nDigital painting 2048px x 2048pxs",
