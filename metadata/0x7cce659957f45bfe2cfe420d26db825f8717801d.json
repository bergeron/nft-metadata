    "description": "My dreams are sometimes dark, I feel them when I am there. Most of them occur in a place I feel like I should not be, almost like I am being given a tour.\nI set about trying to remember and  re create the dwellers of this world I had seen.\nQuarzon was one such character, crying out to the darkened sky, something growing around it's neck which seemed to agitate him/her...it.\nIn some way recreating these beings both exiles them from my dreams and legitimizes them at the same time. Demon, tortured soul, alien or all of these I couldn't say.\n ",
