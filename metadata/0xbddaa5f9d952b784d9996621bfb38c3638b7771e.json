    "description": "I took this photo on a whim walking past Amsterdam Billiards and Bar on 11th Street and 4th Ave in Manhattan. The character in the photograph looks like an average 'Bill' to me. His worn down work shirt and rolled up sleeves can say a lot about him. If I had to guess, he is probably getting his rounds of pool in after a long day of work at his office job, but we'll never know for sure.\n\n1/1 Ed!t!on by ALLEGEDLY.",
