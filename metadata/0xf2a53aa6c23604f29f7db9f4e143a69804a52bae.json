    "description": "Watercress Wand, extinct. c. 1971\n\nThe Watercress Wand was a rare species of flowering plant in the family Tropaeolaceae, originating in the Andes from Bolivia north to Colombia.\n\nIt's flowering head acted as a \"wand\" to hypnotize predators; first, the spongy head would perspirate an alluring scent, captivating nearby predators. The persperiation would turn to a sticky poisoness substance within seconds, capturing predators that came in direct contact. Finally, the spongy head would envelope it's threat, and consume it, if possible. \n\n--  \n  \nCreated in collaboration with AI\n\n--",
