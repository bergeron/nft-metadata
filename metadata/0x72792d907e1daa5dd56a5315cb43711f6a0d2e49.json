    "description": "Abstractium: Mind is a limited art collection created by Australian artist, Benjamin Dawson. Only 365 pieces in the collection, each to resemble the daily opportunities we get to improve and grow from our failures.\n\nEach piece is a 1/1 and has been individually named by Ben to capture the meaning behind the art. The styles & colours in the collection vary, with the hope you find something that speaks to you.\n\nThis collection was created from expression of the mind and captured in digital art form. Join in on the journey as Benjamin takes you on a abstract adventure.Â ",
