    "description": "The now forgotten City Hall station in Lower Manhattan. Shot October of 2015.\n\nAs of 2022, The New York City transit system is made up of 656 track miles, with 468 stations, all of which started right here in 1904. Doors were forever closed in 1945 where it has sat empty and cold for years. I brought my tripod this time with a shot already in mind. I found a tarp and threw it over me so I would not be seen by the conductor. \n\nLaid down, far south east corner of the station. I adjusted my camera's settings and stuck my tripod out, then waited for a 6 train to make the round-about before heading back uptown.\nIt paid off. \n\nFull brassed chandeliers, Guastavino tiles, skylights above, man, things like this do not exist anymore. It feels like a painting down here. The station rests below City Hall, not a place you want to be caught in. Difficulties with access, but we figured it out. \n\nThis photograph jump started my career. Some people donâ€™t know this place exists, but dang, to me? Home",
