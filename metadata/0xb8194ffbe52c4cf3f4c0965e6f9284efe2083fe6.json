With my first NFT, I want to celebrate my goal in this world by showing the best IMAGs that I've produced in the last years.\nLike a business card or a portfolio, I want to set this moment in the blockchain.\nThis is the starting point of a lot of experimentation about Notch x Foundation.\n\n3840x4320px\n60fps\n.mp4\n\nLorenzo Venturini\n2022",
