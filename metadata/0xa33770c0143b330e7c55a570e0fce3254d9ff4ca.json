    "description": " I’m scared and I can hardly move \nI’m way too frightened \nFear follows us , stalks us and controls us \nIt’s all I think \nA heart pounding exaltation into realms of the unknown \nParalyzing dilemmas of insufferable images portrayed as our own \nStrong but weak \nHappy but sad \nSometimes feeling hopeful \nScared a mad uncertain \nI’m way too frightened \nNot the people but the mind \nNot the answer but the question \nHave you ever watched a deer caught in the headlights look fleeing through his eyes ? \nOr a rabbit when it knows it has been seen ?\nWhen they stop working the instant and hopes to disappear ? \nSuspended from the ability to think \nOverwhelmed and over stressed \nTraumatized and shocked in disbelief \nYou watch their spirits shrivel up and die ? \nAnd all you could think of was \nI’m giving up \nMy voice \nMy story \nMy sorrows and my pains",
