    "description": "Artist - Keri Little  \nLocation - Auckland, New Zealand  \nThese pieces were a collaboration with my 14 year old daughter during lockdown. My daughter is an incredibly creative empath, during lockdown we recognised that we both needed to inject some creativity into each day. She did her face paint, I took the photos and we worked together to add the effects and music to produce these small mindful moments. Our intention is for you as the viewer to maintain focus on the eyes, whilst drawing a breath and balancing yourself with both the sound and movement.  \n\nThe word associated with this moment is ENLIGHTENMENT.",
