    "description": "Paul, a dreamer since his first breath,\nLost in thought, creating worlds with depth.\nBut as he grew, his dreams took flight,\nConsume his mind, day and night.\n\nFriends and family, they all implore,\nFocus on now, not what's in store.\nBut Paul's mind became a tunnel, see,\nNo way out, just creativity.\n\nAt first, he loved the freedom it gave,\nCreating universes with characters brave.\nBut as time went on, he felt trapped in his mind,\nNo escape, his thoughts were unkind.\n\nShe resolved to break free from his mind's hold,\nYet every time he tried, his thoughts took ahold.\nHe grew dejected and felt such dismay,\nHis mind was a prison, he couldn't find his way\n\nA bright idea came to him one day,\nTo use his thoughts and make them sway.\nPaul wrote of characters brave and true,\nSharing his gift with the world anew.\n\nTunnel vision a gift, he realized with glee,\nExploring his creativity, setting it free.\nPaul broke free, and in doing so,\nDiscovered a new world of possibility to grow.",
