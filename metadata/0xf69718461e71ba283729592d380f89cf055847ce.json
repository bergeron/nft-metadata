    "description": "This is an image of our neighbouring galaxy M33 the Triangulum galaxy taken from my backyard using amateur astrophotography equipment. It is a beautiful spiral galaxy and is the furthest object from earth visible to the naked eye from very dark skies. Its elegance is sprinkled with an abundance of large pink Hydrogen nebula. These areas fizz with energy and emit the hot pink colours. Within them the Hydrogen draws together into masses which birth new stars. These stars then form all the heavier elements and the building blocks of life. The large nebula NGC 604 to the bottom left is the largest nebula in our local group of galaxies.\n\nMy Galaxy Szn Collection is an upgradeable deep space astrophotography collection. Objects will be upgraded over the years as new higher resolution equipment is obtained.\n\nA physical fine art print will be made for the first collector should they wish it.\n\nPhotographer: Ronan Hunt  \nFull Resolution: 2455x1523 pix, 1/1 Edition Jpeg  \nImage Credit: Ronan Hunt",
