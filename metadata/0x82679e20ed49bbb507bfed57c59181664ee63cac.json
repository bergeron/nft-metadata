    "description": "Ada is the firstborn which makes her Chanzo’s vessel. Through her, the women of Alta are bestowed their gifts. She is a strong and graceful Opanin (leader) but being Zo’s vessel is harder than it seems. She possesses the gift of intangibility (alter her atoms) and hyper powered senses. With the sudden appearance of an enemy, Ada is forced to make a decision that will change Alta forever.",
