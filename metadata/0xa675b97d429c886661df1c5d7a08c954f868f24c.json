    "description": "\"Regret and anxiety. I never thought that secrets told long ago could be dangerous. So I'd better keep my mouth shut, because now I can hardly trust anyone.\"\n\nThis picture represents my personal experience of regretting what I said. Naivety sometimes makes you trust people without making sure they are trustworthy. \nMy protagonist is strong. She cries inside, but she doesn't show it. Now she knows how to be safe, mistakes she has been taught.\n",
