    "name": "MEDUSA and ATHENA",
    "description": "Medusa was a mortal beauty devoted to the gods, possessed by feminine power. Poseidon rapes her on a marble in the Temple of Athena. Athena could not tolerate such disrespect and turned Medusa into a fearsome creature like her sisters and her beautiful hair into snakes. Anyone who looks into Medusa's eyes turns into stone.\n\n The Medusa story symbolizes a transformation. Throughout our lives, we go through times when we find ourselves frozen, stuck. This can signal us to change our paralyzed psyche. Athena apologizes to Medusa for her own clogged soul.",
