    "description": "It's not often that everything lines up perfectly in nature... But this was one of those rare moments. I was trekking through the towering peaks of the Italian Dolomites during sunrise and I was taken aback when magical light rays began to leak through the mountain layers.\n\nI wasn't able to get a good vantage point from where I was hiking, so I flew my drone straight up above my head. My jaw dropped as layer after layer of serrated peaks revealed themselves to me, glistening as the sun kissed the golden fields that dressed them.\n\nAfter starting my morning surrounded by some of Mother Nature's most beautiful artwork, I hurried back down the mountain and had a hot cup of some of the most delicious espresso I've ever had.\n\nThe mountains of Italy will forever hold a special place in my heart and I can't wait to go back.",
