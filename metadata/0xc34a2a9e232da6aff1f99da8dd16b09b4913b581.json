    "description": "Paula has covid. She has just tested positive and knows that she has to be two weeks without leaving her room. From time to time she does modelling work although her dream is to be a fashion designer. Sick, with no job and no plans in sight, she laid in bed depressed.\n\nSuddenly a bright light came through the window. She watched as the rays illuminated her skin, as if she could grab it between her fingers. She took out her mobile phone to capture the moment, combed her hair with her hand and took a selfie in front of the mirror.\n\nSize: 4677x5846 PX",
