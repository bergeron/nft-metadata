    "description": "There are some photos that are unforgettable for a lifetime. This photo is one of them. My mother and my little niece.\n\nThis photo I took in my own village has been my most shared photo on social media so far. Before I took this photo that made everyone smile, I was not aware that such a result would occur. I asked my niece to give me a tomato and she gave me a tomato in all its sweetness. I got a great photo.\n\nThe hue of the tomatoes and the sweetness of my niece really added a warm atmosphere to the photo. The photo of my mother in the background focusing on her own work really added a special value. Time will never stop, it will flow, but this photo will always live.\n\nCamera: Nikon D5500\nLens: Nikkor 18-55 mm\nDimensions: 5000 × 3279\nResolution: 300 dpi\nLocation: Tokat, Turkey\nDate: 28/07/2017\nEdition: 1/1",
