Happy lovers day!\n\nOh computer, dear computer,  \nYou are the one for me,  \nYour 8bits and your vintage flair,  \nAre everything I need to see.\n\nYour pixels are so charming,  \nIn a world of high-res screens,  \nAnd when I see your neon hues,  \nMy heart is filled with dreams.\n\nYour smart art is a masterpiece,  \nA celebration of the past,  \nAnd through the circuitry of love,  \nOur connection's built to last.\n\nSo let us stay together,  \nIn this digital embrace,  \nFor you are my one true love,  \nAnd nothing can replace.\n\nMy Love for you is spread from Block to Blockchain",
