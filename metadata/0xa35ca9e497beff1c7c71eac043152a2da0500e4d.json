    "description": "Unknown Descartes' Island might be in the bright dream of a woman. The borders of the sea's waves might have been built these borders.\nIt's passengers were only women and their destination was the dark shadow of a cup.\nThe women of Descartes's Island were watching the shadows of giant ships which were burning on seas. And it seems that defining the borders between the horizon and shadows is the most difficult job.\nThe seas are burning of the flame of the ships and the women's dreams relocate again like the shadow of a broken cup.\nOil on canvas\n20*30",
