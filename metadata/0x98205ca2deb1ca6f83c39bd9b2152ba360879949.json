    "description": "A light emitting material is mapped on an array of 360 squares resembling a layered and twisted torus-like shape.\n\nThe array spins around it's tilted vertical axis while the pattern of the material follows a 360 degrees eccentric rotation movement within each square, thus creating the illusion of perpetual motion.\n\nThe piece is made by combining 360 individually rendered frames into a 12 second looping animation.\n\n1200x1200 MP4 File",
