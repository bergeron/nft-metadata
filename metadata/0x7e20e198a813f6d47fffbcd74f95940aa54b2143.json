    "description": "Kashmir is a digital collage art piece that take a journey through a surreal landscape. The title refers to the idea of revisiting our travels after a long, seemingly never-ending drive through the waste lands of life. It is about the road journey itself rather than a specific geographical location.\n\nThe artwork features a blend of real-life images, and digital elements that come together to create a dreamlike scene.\nKashmir is a celebration of the journey itself, rather than the destination. It encourages us to embrace the ups and downs of life's travels, and to appreciate the beauty and wonder that can be found along the way.\n\nDigital Collage\n4000px x 3000px\n2023",
