    "description": "This “Menina” is a digital piece homaging the famous Spanish painter Velazquez. It depicts Infanta Margarita, the main character of the famed painting “Las Meninas” —reimagined from a modern perspective with a gestual, visually-striking style. Done with flowing half-abstract half-figurative brushstrokes, the master-lines of the central figure are extracted and juxtaposed against a textured, grainy background, done 100% digitally. The result conveys an image that is both atemporal and iconic, merging the symbolism and transcendency of history with the strength and passion of raw contemporaneity.",
