Each token represents our commitment to providing continuous utility and innovation for our community. From the get-go, every WHIM Alpha token grants priority access to the first generation of canvas pre-orders; in the future, what we can promise you is that there is much more to come and that WHIM is committed to providing continuous value for the whole community. \n\n P.S. In order to unlock the full underlying art experience for this NFT, youâ€™ll need to find WHIM in the wild and show it on your canvas. It appears differently in the physical world than it does on your favorite marketplace. \n\n Additional Content: \n\n [Shop on a WHIM](https://onawhim.com)",
