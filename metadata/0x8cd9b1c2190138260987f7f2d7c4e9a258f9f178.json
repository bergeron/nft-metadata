    "description": "When I first began using VR and exploring virtual environments about eight years ago, we didn't have the opportunities available to easily build our own worlds to explore. Now with the dawn of platforms like Spatial, AltSpace, Decentraland, Sandbox etc... people are able to build things on their own. This led me to start creating these plasticine-style rainbows for people to use in their virtual environments and they've been brightening up spaces ever since!",
