    "description": "Garrick is my childhood nickname, my alter ego, which I have carried through my life. Garrick has always had trouble socializing and finding his place in society. He's looking for himself and helping me find myself in this world.  \nGarri—Åk doesn't have a single identity and he doesn't belong only to me. A child's alter ego lives in all of us and it is very important to give it freedom. Because when it gets freedom, we too become free, and personal freedom is the search for ourselves.",
