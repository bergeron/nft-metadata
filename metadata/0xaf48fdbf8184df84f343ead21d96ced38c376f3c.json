    "description": "I captured this photograph on 35mm film in the Mt Baker wilderness of Washington state. My favorite thing about autumn in the alpine is the fleeting nature of everything. The way steam fills the air in the morning as the sun burns the frost from the night before, and the way this makes colors less vibrant with each passing day. The way air smells as berries and foliage fall from their branches and begin to decompose, providing minerals and nutrients to the soil which will become new life next spring. The knowing, as I walk around surrounded by beauty and rich color, that very soon everything I see will be buried under a sea of snow and ice. Everything about autumn reminds me to enjoy the present, and capturing the beauty in those moments helps preserve them forever. ",
