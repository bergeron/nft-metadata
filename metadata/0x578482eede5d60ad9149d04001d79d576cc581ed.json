    "description": "Pushing the bounds of where the physical meets the digital, Miami graffiti artist Jona Cerwinske drops his first-ever fully hybrid collection in the Streets of Soho during NFT.NYC 2022. As the featured performance at One of None’s Hybrid Gallery, Jona creates a custom 8x8 foot wall while being streamed inside the Gallery in real-time.
