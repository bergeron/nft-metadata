    "description": "This piece along with \"Octovision\" were very out of the normal for me. It was a step in a brand new direction that I was not at all familiar with. At the time I had people ask me what the piece meant, and to this day I'm still not sure. I do know that I tapped into something while creating it though. \n\nThis original piece is 7.5\" x 6\" and is redeemable only by the collector of the NFT. Please reach out via twitter to discuss further details after the purchase has been fulfilled. ",
