    "description": "This photo series was photographed using a special technique called Light Painting. This involves a long exposure with a moving light source that is used to paint the different parts of the subject with light. These individual shots are then later composited using post-processing software to come up with the final image.\n\nMy YouTube channel shows the evolution of these photographs.",
