    "description": "Dear ser or fren\n\nI just wanted to say THANK YOU to yall for being with me on this weird journey for these two weird years. I am humbled and honored to have so many online strangers to throw money at me to own my art. This is amazing and crazy!\n\nI know this year hit hard many of you. I appreciate those of you who kickstarted my cryptoart career during the bull run. I appreciate those of you who kept on collecting during the bear.\n\nExpect more art from me, both on Ethereum and Tezos. Even on bitcoin/XCP! Maybe something before the end of the year. \n\nI believe the next year will be no worse than 2022. Actually, I believe it will be much better. For 2023 I wish you less wars and viruses but more pixels, big and smol.\n\nMerry Xmas, Yole, Winter Solstice, whatever you celebrate. And a happy New Year!\n\nSincerely yours,  \nBadFoxLab\n\nP.S. I finally figured out how to let ALL of you know I moved from this address to the new one in the beginning of this year (duh). Some of you already know that, but not everyone is on twitter so here I am spamming your wallet. This letter is minted from the OG wallet. I still hold the keys for it, but since I donâ€™t have the seed phrase to import to Trezor/Ledger I decided it would be safer to use new wallet. For the provenance!\n\n-----BEGIN ETHEREUM SIGNED MESSAGE-----  \nThis token is minted with 0xb26F7C17aD8fA03Dbe3f60E464b3E1dfE0D96D91 a.k.a. badfoxlabarchives.eth and signed with 0xDa07Cbe67aCA847143e56294f4148fdB75550c64 a.k.a. badfoxlab.eth  \n-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----  \n0xDa07Cbe67aCA847143e56294f4148fdB75550c64  \n2f78ec3e01226d535369c0154ea138b6d088cb72a62ff122a59b3fe51c243c81153326705b74069a5fde4d48e6670122a0f0ff6059e55408223944eb206d928a1b  \n-----END ETHEREUM SIGNED MESSAGE-----",
