    "name": "King of the Castles",
    "description": "If you want to explore Scotland's history, look no further than the mighty castle. Kilchurn, a 15th century ruin on the banks of Loch Awe, is my personal favourite. On a fortuitous visit, the wind was still and the vibrant colours were on full display. I felt this image highlighted the beauty of the castle, but also the history of what might have happened on these shores and within these walls. If only we could know.\n\n15% of the proceeds will be donated to Historic Environment, the leading public body who investigate and promote Scotlandâ€™s ancient sites, including Kilchurn Castle.
