    "description": "RAWCONTENT_00 is the first piece of Mauri de Haro’s genesis collection. \nThe collection explores audiovisual content’s transition from the posed, performative, “fake” nature of social media, to a movement of casual, authentic, and raw creators. Tiktok has paved the way for content to be raw, fast, homemade and experimental. It is redefining the way we communicate and present our digital selves, but most importantly it is pushing out the toxic perfectionism of the millennial instagram era, making way for a digital age of raw content.\n\nDimensions: 1920x1920px\nFormat: .mov\n\nCreated January 2022\n",
