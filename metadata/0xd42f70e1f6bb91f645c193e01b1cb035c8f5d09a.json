    "name": "Circe and Her Lions",
    "description": "Circe is an enchantress and a minor goddess in Greek mythology. She is either a daughter of the god Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse or the goddess Hecate and AeÃ«tes. Circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs. Through the use of these and a magic wand or staff, she would transform her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals.\nThis is my interpretation of the goddess with her beloved lions. \n",
