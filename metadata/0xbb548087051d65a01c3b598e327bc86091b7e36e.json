    "description": "This photo was taken the first time I camped at Mount Rainier. It will always hold a special place in my heart and is why I chose it for my Genesis piece.  \n\nThe transformative experience of seeing the mountain at such a vantage point was indescribable. It felt like immeasurable warmth and safety, even at 6,000 ft (1828m) of elevation. This quickly became one of the first photographs I was truly proud of capturing.\n\nThe alpine meadows, lush mossy forest, incredible fauna and fungi are a magical wonder that simply transform the soul. \n\nThis mountain truly changed my life.",
