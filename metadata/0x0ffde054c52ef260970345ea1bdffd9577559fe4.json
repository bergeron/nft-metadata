    "description": "ollollo is an environmental PFP project to respond to climate change and is a collection of 9,999 unique NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. 12 animals are angry. The reason is that climate change has made it difficult to live on Earth. So the angry animals boarded the ollollo.\n\nOwning an ollollo means joining the Speak Up campaign to save the earth. Ollollo original holders will have the right to combine with other PFPs.\n\nFor more information, please visit the official ollollo website (www.ollollo.io).",
