    "description": "The sounds of the city can also be likened to a living organism, pulsing with energy and life. The hum of the engines is the heartbeat, the screech of brakes the breath, and the honking of horns the voice of the city, all working together in a frenzied dance. It's a sound that embodies the hustle and bustle of urban life, a reminder that the city never sleeps, but is always alive with activity.\n\n\n-By minting this photograph, you are getting the opportunity to enter the raffle.  \n-50 minted Space Rider giveaway  \n-100 minted 0.3 eth giveaway\n\nThank you for supporting my photography and good luck.",
