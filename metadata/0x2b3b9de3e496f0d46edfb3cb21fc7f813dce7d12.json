    "description": "      I wrote and produced this song during an existential crisis (it has lasted 24 years and counting. Damn you Kafka for enlightening me). I wanted to articulate the feeling of not giving a shit about anything, or anyone. It's the second before the last song on my album that I have been releasing on Sound. This song felt so honest when I wrote it, that I almost didn't release it. But that wouldn't have been very \"nothing matters, I'm having an existential crisis\" of me. It's my favorite song to sing live. I hope when you listen to it, it feels like I'm telling you secrets. \n\nThe drums in the song are actually just me tapping on my desk (aside from the kick). Obviously I spruced them up and OTT'd them to hell. \n\nFor the record, I love second dates. \n\n\n\n\n",
