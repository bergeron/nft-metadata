    "description": "When darkness took over the sky\nand the battle was over\nWhen silence pierced the land\nWhen the snow fell in sorrow\nWhen there were no more tears\nno more screams,\nno more laments,\nand no more blood to be spilled\n\nThen She will emerged from the ground,\nher hair would absorb all the blood\nand her crimson threads would seize all the souls without mercy\nFor She was the Red Grim\nAnd She was as colossal as the Titans themselves\nAnd She felt nothing as she sang the lullaby of the Deaths.\n\npencil on paper, edited in Photoshop",
