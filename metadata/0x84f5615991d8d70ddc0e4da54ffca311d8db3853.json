    "description": "I think as artists we are much better manifestors than we like to admit. Often times we will subconsciously seek out situations that are detrimental to us, just so we can feel. Even when others mishandle us, we actively welcome it, almost to invite a catalyst for the transformation we so desperately seek.\n\nWriting this song taught me what I was capable of and what happens when I let life happen to me vs when I become an active participant in my own story.  \n\nI'm grateful to share this with a mended heart and renewed purpose. \n\nI'm using a song that represents a dark period in my life to bring light to a fellow artist who is routinely a light in my life. 15% of the sale will go to Miles Ryan Harris to help with ongoing legal fees as he navigates being the best father he can be to his two boys.\n\nThank you for listening to HurtMe. I hope it serves to heal you as much as it has healed me, or maybe it's no that deep and you just think it sounds pretty idk lol\n\nProduced by B.Sharpe& Myself\nWritten by Myself and Lauren Marie\nCover Art Photography Rashaad Piggot edits by Isadore Noir w/ consult from Splash Gordon\nManagement: AugusBanned",
