    "description": "This was an incredible storm to witness. For years now, I have been trying to capture lighting strikes over the city. Storms have either fizzled out as they reached the city, rains have been too heavy to shoot in, or work has kept me from trying. Factors finally lined up for me, and I raced out with my gf to shoot. Wow what an evening it turned into. The images used for this composite were all shot on my Leica Q, fully manual (focus, shutter press, etc). This is a combination of 2 images: the double bolts over the pedestrian bridge, and the last image we took, the bolts on the right, before running for cover. Shot on a wide angle lens, you can see and even feel how close that far right bolt got to us! Such an awesome experience and to be able to share it with her, and now with you, makes it all worth it.",
