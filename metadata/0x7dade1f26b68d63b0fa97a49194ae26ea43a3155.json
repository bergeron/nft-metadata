    "description": "I am Habibullah Ehsani, a B.S holder in architecture. I'm from the Emirates . I started my artistic pursuits in 2011. Initially, I got engaged in the woodwork area, but having felt that I did not have the chance or possibility to create an artwork to gain some mental satisfaction, I decided to turn to making sculptures using mud and framing in the following years. After two years, I started to work on wire staples, developing an interest in crafting wire sculptures and statues eventually.\n\nThe materials used in my works include various staple wires such as copper wire, brass, steel, bronze, phosphorus, silver and gold.\n\nTo build a substructure for the wired sculptures, natural materials such as different types of rocks like travertine, marble, granite, and all kinds of wood like poplar, oak and-walnut are used.\n\nAfter the artwork , I started taking pictures of the works to turn it into a photo and give it to the NFT so that others will take the pleasure of creating them.",
