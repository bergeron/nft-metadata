    "description": "This holiday season, CAA honors caregivers with a donation in your name to #FirstRespondersFirst and CARE, organizations that provide support to those who help others in need. We partnered with three incredible NFT artists to shine a light on the caregivers and the frontline heroes in all our lives with unique and collectible works of art.\n \nNyla Hayes is a 13-year-old creator of the NFT collection, “Long Neckie Ladies.” The multi-million-dollar collection features diverse women with elongated necks inspired by her favorite dinosaur, the Brontosaurus. She was named the first-ever Artist-in-Residence by TIMEPieces, a web3 community initiated by TIME.",
