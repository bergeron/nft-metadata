    "description": "I have spent a decade registering queer folk and artists in their often life-taking quests for overcoming objectification and struggle and becoming the subjects of their empowered selves.\n\nMade in February 2023, Portrait of Absence is an autobiographical piece, the first of a series of 3 self-portraits that mark the launch of the Portraits Collection by Hugo Faz, meant to harbor photographic statements that give the faces — or bodies — of queer creators yet another medium to tell their stories. And through these statements, make sure they stay alive.\n\n5400 x 3600 jpeg.\n\nSigned archival quality print to be shipped to collector at cost upon request.",
