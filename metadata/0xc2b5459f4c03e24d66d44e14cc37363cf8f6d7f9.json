    "description": "When we study history, we get very sad and wonder what caused a war to start and kill so many innocent people?Perhaps the answer to this question lies with the leaders who caused these wars, such as: Saddam, Hitler, Putin, ....During the war, famine, disease, depression destroy that country, but there is another very important issue;  rape of innocent girls! Girls who were broken for the crime of being girls and their broken pieces will never be put back again. But I want to tell you Ukrainian girls that the whole world hears your voice and we know how strong you are. I wish peace and tranquility to all the people of the world.",
