When humans leave the planet these are the plants that will thrive in our wake, nourished by our bodies. \n\nThis is the moment, the epiphany. It isn’t too late to learn. \n\n---\n\nThis is the genesis piece on my Leopardslunch 2.0 contract, \nmy most detailed piece to date, and a true piece of me. \n\n6000 x 6000 px JPEG",
