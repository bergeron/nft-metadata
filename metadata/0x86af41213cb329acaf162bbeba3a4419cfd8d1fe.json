    "description": "It's always cold in this city  \nbut now is a really cold winter  \nWe welcome the New Year with fake happy faces,  \ncelebrating it close to paper fireplaces \n\nWe imitate joy, follow the marketing plan,  \nbuy gifts and decorate our place.  \nBut deep inside it is hard to be fun  \nbecause of the lack of embrace\n\nWe play a part in this celebration  \nbut in fact, it is empty to us.  \nWe're so tired of all bad sensations  \nBut in the paper fireplaces, there isn't the gas\n\nBut we stay hiding our pain  \nand continue to play our part.  \nEvery year we play that game  \nWelcome the New Year, let's start!",
