    "description": "My work is inspired by nature, the female face and fundamentally by spring, the season that creates life. \n\nThe flower I have chosen for this Lilith is lavender, a flower with relaxing properties. \n\nThis Lilith is hand sculpting from white clay, bisque fired and dipped inside in a clear glaze solution then fired a second time.\n\nPhysical ceramic art for the first buyer.\n\nEach Lilith is a unique piece, and due to the completely handmade nature of the craft can have slight imperfections; although, this adds to the character and life of the piece.\n\nWith Love:\n\n☼ 𝙴𝚍é𝚗 𝚍𝚎 𝙻𝚒𝚕𝚒𝚝𝚑 ╽𝚁𝚊𝚚𝚞𝚎𝚕 ☾\n\n\n",
