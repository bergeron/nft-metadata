    "name": "COMMUNITY BUILDING - 3D Polaroid",
    "description": "Community building has been an eye-opening art form. It is gritty, humbling work. It takes time and intention. There’s something special about being able to organize and motivate folks around you. \n\nI see a lot of myself reflected in this young person. Each part of their outfit is an indicator of the path ahead. \n\nThe empty red bucket - a symbol of Faith - knowing you won’t have to carry it forever. But also knowing that it is a necessary tool for gathering resources for the community you’re working to uplift. \nThe shoes stepping out of the frame - symbolizing how one must step outside of the box in order to move forward toward change.\nThe gold circle framed glasses - for a clear vision of your growing dream. \n\nArtist: Raven50mm\n\nMedium: Digital Photography\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nCopyright: ©Raven Trammell.
