    "description": "_\"O Lord, grant health in my child's body, health in his hearing, health in his sight. There is none worthy of being worshipped except You.\"_\n\n> Dear Child,  \n> No matter how tough do you think I am,  \n> It is merely what I sought to be,  \n> For I will protect you with all my might,  \n> Even if my life is the price,  \n> I'd cut my chest open if it saves you baby.\n\nMay this sickness grow you stronger,  \nMay this hard time reminds me to love you better,  \nForgive me for sometimes being childish,  \nWhat could be deemed unfit of a good Father. **\n\nThis piece drawn along with prayers for my child's speedy recovery from the recent outbreak.  \nWhile I broke into tears looking at him lay weak on the bed, he said to me.\n\n**\"Be happy Daddy, or I'll be sad too\"**, and broke into tears.\n\n_I'm sorry love.  \nI'll be tougher next time.  \nI love you,  \nIn every  prayers I beseech you get well soon._\n\nYxji",
