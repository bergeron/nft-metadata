    "name": "Water lily confetti",
    "description": "Instead of receiving a bunch of flowers I love to go to the places where those flowers grow and where they will stay after I go. Among my favourite types are Water lilies. They are actually the only reason I love to do kayaking. \nTheir long stems with the gentle crown of petals on the top, these big leaves that sometimes could cover entire surface of the water around you... What a beautiful structure you flow through ..very very slowly.. to do not hurt any blossoming soul. It slows you down as physically as mentally. And finally frozen for a moment, you can take a glance at every nuance of this amazing carpet.\n\nThis nft based on an oilpainting I made in 2021. \nThe size of canvas was 120x160cm.\n\nNFT: 5551x7483px",
