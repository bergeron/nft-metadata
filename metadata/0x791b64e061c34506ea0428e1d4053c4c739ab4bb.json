    "description": "LIGHT AND ELEGANCE  \nThe soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life. And the body is born young and grows old. That is life's tragedy. Oscar Wilde  \nHuman is a perfect being.It consists of body and soul. The human body is the most perfect being of nature. It is perfect, also it works perfectly. In this work, we wanted to show the elegance of human body, the perfect structure that nature offers us, by combining light and color elements.  \nThe art of photography gives us the opportunity to immortalize the \"beauty\". When the power of light and the human body come together, “aesthetics” emerges.  \n  This work is a show of respect for the human body.\n\nLeyla EMEKTAR  \nMehmet ÖZASLAN",
