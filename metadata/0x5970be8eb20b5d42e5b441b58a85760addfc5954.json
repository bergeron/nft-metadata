    "description": "Head in the Clouds: A place of creation.\n\n\"Head in the clouds\" is an old idiom that has always had a stigma attached to it. To have your head in the clouds meant you were absentminded, impractical, unrealistic; out of touch with reality; living in a fantasy/dream world. It is a term that is used to describe a person who is often found daydreaming and lost in his/her own thoughts. Oftentimes, that's us: the artists, the creators, the dreamers.\n\nDespite its negative connotation, I believe that having your head in the clouds is a powerful place to be because it is a place of creation. It is where you dream, visualize, and manifest. This is the space where we meet our higher selves and tap into God/The Universe/Source/Spirit/The Creator: the God within us all. All things first start in your mind, and then physically manifest in your reality. So when you have your head in the clouds, yes you may appear to be tapped out, but actually you're tapped IN.\n\n1/1\nJPG\n4,000x3242px\nMedium format film",
