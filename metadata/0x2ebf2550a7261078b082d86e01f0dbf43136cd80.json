    "description": "Barbara Davidson’s series “Pandemic Evidence” freezes in time how Angelenos  looked and felt during California’s ‘lock down’ and will lend a historical context to the Coronavirus for decades to come. All of these images were created in the same location, at 5th and Broadway, once the cities’ main commercial area, in downtown Los Angeles. Every portrait is made in front of a black metallic boarded-up storefront. This visual approach is intentional. By stripping down the environment to a basic black backdrop, the viewer’s gaze is focused on the details, belongings, and expressions of the individual. The aim of this collection is to present pandemic evidence for future generations in the form of a visual time capsule. ",
