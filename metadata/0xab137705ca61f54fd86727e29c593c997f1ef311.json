    "name": "MAESTRO MEZCALERO",
    "description": "El Maestro Mezcalero. The hands that planted the hijuelo 8 years prior are the same hands holding the coa de jima cutting the leaves off the agave. He retrieves the piña and roasts it in his rock lined oven (a hole in the ground). He mashes the cooked agaves to a pulp, mixes them with water, and yeast, and fermentation occurs. He runs the liquid through a still until it’s a drinkable spirit. A process taught to him by his padre and abuelito, taught to them by their ancestors. He’s sweated through every step and the his callus-lined hands can prove it. His dedication to the process, heritage, and work ethic make each sip meaningful. His history, science, and dedication.",
