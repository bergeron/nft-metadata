The artwork in the ERC-721 token will comprise of the artworks from the ERC-1155s, that were burnt in exchange for it. \n\nThe combinations of ERC-1155 eligible for burning in exchange for a 1/1 ERC-721 are:  \n- NOSTALGIA - 1, 2, 4, 5  \n- NOSTALGIA - 4, 5, 7, 8  \n- NOSTALGIA - 2, 3, 5, 6  \n- NOSTALGIA - 5, 6, 8, 9  \n- NOSTALGIA - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n\nNote that only one ERC-721 token can ever be minted from the NOSTALGIA series. It will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. If someone has already redeemed the 1/1 ERC-721 NOSTALGIA by collecting and burning the corresponding 1155s, future collectors will not have the 1/1 option available to them. \n\nNOSTALGIA - FRAMES  \nby  \nununkx",
