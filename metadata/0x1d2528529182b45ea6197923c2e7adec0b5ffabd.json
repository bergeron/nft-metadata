    "description": "I consider this to be one of the best artworks I have ever produced. The kind of work I used to dream of when I was getting started. And also, it's the first addition to my \"Artist Favorites\" collection. I can only hope that, in time, more works will find their way here. How many, I don't know. My heart will decide what touches it.\n\nPieta depicts the Virgin Mary holding the body of Christ after his crucifixion. It is, above all else, a powerful and emotional representation of the sorrow and suffering of a mother losing her son. \n\nMy obvious inspiration, Michelangelo`s Pieta, with its emotional power and artistic excellence, has inspired many artists throughout the centuries. It is a testament to the enduring power of art to capture the human experience and touch the hearts of viewers across generations.",
