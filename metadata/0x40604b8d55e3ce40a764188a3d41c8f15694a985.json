    "description": "\"Nocturne\" is a collaboration between MCHX and Azerty Betamax.\n\nAn audio visual experience with late night vibes. The visual, created from javascript and CSS and reacts to the audio. \n\nThe visuals were inspired by the works of 20th century abstract artists, retrofuturism ideas and space films. In combination with music, it aims to create a pleasant relaxing environment for the viewer. The visual includes 8 different versions united by one idea and color palette. Animation is tied to sound effects and is generated indefinitely. Each token has its own unique set of design and appearance at the beginning, but the colors and shapes of some of its elements change during the animation process. The generative music is endless, different each time and created entirely from code. A unique bank of notes is determined each time it is run and the music is played using only this selection for your copy. A lead synthesiser sound is also chosen randomly from four possibilities.\n\nClick on the canvas to start the music.",
