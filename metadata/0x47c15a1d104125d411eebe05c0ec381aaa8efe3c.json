    "description": "Roope Rainisto's series RECOLLECTION MACHINE examines human memory and our relationship with technology: our insatiable hunger to create, capture, and consume memories, no matter whether these memories are real or imagined. The transmitted signals compress the richness of experiences into lossy compressed copies, making them more palatable and consumable.\n\nThe cold terminals, the myriad of displays, gather our attention, seemingly plain, neutral, and unadorned. From these devices, moments can be recalled endlessly over until they cease to create emotions in us. The past overcomes the present. We obsess about the past, ignore living in the present, creating memories about watching memories. \n\nRECOLLECTION MACHINE is part of the exhibition RECOLLECTION. AI AND MEMORY presented by EXPANDED.ART in collaboration with The NFT Gallery at their galleries in New York and London, 11 April – 13 May 2023.\n\n19 artists explore the idea of further challenging the concreteness of human memory—personal or collective—through creative collaboration with AI.\n\nMemories are nebulous. Scientific studies and phenomena such as \"The Mandela Effect\" have shown that humans rarely recall things in their unbiased exactitude. Artificial Intelligence already assists human memory in the form of predictive text and GPS navigation. One would surmise that there exists a role for AI when it comes to supplementing even more complex memory.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/d915821d-4a9a-4c1b-be17-bbf4f13b9dc6",
