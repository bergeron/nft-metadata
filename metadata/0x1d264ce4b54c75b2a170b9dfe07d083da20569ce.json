He dreams of going to Burning Man, and I believe we can go there together after the victory of Ukraine. \n\nAfter selling this art, I will buy and give him a ticket to Burning Man. \nAnd a part of the amount will be donated to the Burning Man Project. \n\nCollection: Ukrainians at Burning Man\nFormat: 2048x1152, png\nEdition 1 of 1",
