    "description": "Made by an introvert creating intricate circle patterns | Finding beauty in simplicity | Quietly observing the world |\n\nArt is like a circle, it has no beginning and no end, and just like a circle, it symbolizes wholeness and unity, reminding us that there is always hope for a brighter future.\n\nThis is Lujan's very first mint of the Ballsy Art Pattern collection.\n\nEvery piece has a unique pattern for the observer to discover.  \n\nThere are two consistent patterns that were consciously made in this piece. \n\nThe first one might be obvious while the second one requires having to look a little deeper. In other words, you may need to look beyond the shapes and colors.",
