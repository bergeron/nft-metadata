    "name": "Kiss from Riga",
    "description": "This is the first artwork in the RedLipstick Collection. Riga will always be in my heart coz that's where the journey began. \n\nThis project came to life in one of my favorite places in the Latvian capital: The Armoury Bar. Strange place to think about a project that is supposed to distribute love all around me, isn't it? Not that much! A few glasses of local alcohol, a loving owner and a friendly crowd! Wasn't this the best place to design a project around love? \n\nThe next day, I started the RedLipstick journey. Riga, January, super cold but surprisingly warm. Here is the very first kiss from Sisi The Artist! \n\nThe RedLipstick Collection evolves according to my trips, the people I meet. Each city that touches me will receive a sweet kiss on one of its walls.  Each work is unique and comes with its own story. \n\nWith the purchase of a kiss from the RedLipstick Collection, you also receive a photo of the owner of these lips + a proof of the location of the kiss to prove the authenticity!",
