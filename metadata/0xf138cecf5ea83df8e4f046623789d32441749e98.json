The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.… And God said, “Let there be light”.\n\n'Genesis' reveals to us the primordial myth of Creation (Cosmogenesis), and in addition, an inspiration for these abstract knowledge to help us remember our hidden history: The way back home.",
