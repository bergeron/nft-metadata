They pulled me into a miserable existence and controlled every fibre of my being. I wasted so much time buried in misery because I didn’t know how to be anything else.\n\nEvery damn day, for years on end, looking at life through a dark mirror. \nAnd yet, after all that, all the self-loathing and suffering, \n\nI’m still here.",
