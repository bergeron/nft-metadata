    "description": "Inner Earth is the first of many upcoming AI mixed with landscape pieces I will be releasing. I have been a photographer for over a decade and more so recently I have discovered a whole new medium of art to portray my creative vision in an otherworldly manner. \n\nOver the many years I have learned that creativity should not be held back by rules,or bound by a way that society decides we should perceive art. As an artist I have always imagined the world differently in my own unique vision. This has fundamentally shaped the way I choose to present my art.\n\nNow in this new era of digital art/AI art I will also apply the same vision and walk my own path.\n\nThis particular piece I call \"Inner Earth\" is a mixture of both AI art as well as landscape imagery.",
