    "description": "The stories that we tell ourselves determine our self-image, which determines how we move through each day. NOT4ME is about recognizing and releasing the habits, patterns and stories in life that hurt us more than they contribute to our healing.\n\nNOT4ME has been an affirmation for me throughout the 6 months since I wrote it - it is the story that I told myself to reclaim my identity and learn how to love myself despite persistent feelings of guilt and shame. Releasing these negative feelings allowed me to better show up for myself, re-center creativity and welcome healthier habits into my life.\n\nThis song is more relevant to me now than ever. It has made me more discerning of what supports my growth and what is simply‚Ä¶not for me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nI hope NOT4ME supports your journey in some way.\n\nI hope it makes you smile.\n\nI hope it makes you dance.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•\n\nWritten & Performed by AL3C\nProduced by AL3C & Pete Rango\nMastered by Rome Palermo\nAlbum artwork by Scolla Fungwe & losingmyego\nCommunity support from Campfire & Mochi!\nOutro thoughts from Lackhoney, Mariana Makwaia, Saiko, Tarot & Domino",
