    "name": "The Midnight Demon ",
    "description": "It appears whenever it likes, but most often at midnight when I am alone. Hence, I named it the midnight demon. I don't believe everyone can see it,  though all can feel its presence. It brings a heavy feeling, like something pressing against my chest. Other times the demon is more subtle, lingering just around the corner or waiting at the end of the road. As I grow older, I see it more often, even vividly. I am unable to be rid of it yet, but being able to see the midnight demon means I can also feel when it is not there. I want to know why I can see it better. I have a theory: the demon fears fire, the fire inside us all and the one that lights the way. It could be burning a little brighter these days, leaving the demon nowhere to hide.\n\n\"Late Night Musings\" is a new collection of work and presented as a first-person narrative in exploration of \"self\". All bidders will receive a special bidders' edition titled \"The Fire Inside\". ",
