    "description": "Babylon is a symbol of a mixture of people, a crowd. Nimrod gathered the builders of the tower from all the cities. It was, in modern parlance, the \"building of the century,\" in which, as historians believe, most of the human race of the time was involved. After the tower collapsed, its builders were scattered all over the planet. The communities of people who spoke different languages were formed, and the very peoples of which we are now aware emerged. \nBabylon, as the collective image of the world community, is controlled in the modern world, just as it was in ancient times.\nBut who controls it now?
