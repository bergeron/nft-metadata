    "description": "Hola! I’m Amy Correa Bell, a So Cal native based in the San Fernando Valley. I got into the web3 space exactly one year ago and Wowww! I’m so freakin grateful to be releasing my 3rd NFT here on Sound.xyz and excited to share a sneak peek into what my producer Les Les and I have been cooking up for my upcoming LP.  \n\nNew Wave Vocals cross with native Marimbas over tribal drums creating a sound ready for the dance floor.  It activates freedom of expression with a message to GO forward, casting aside distractions while giving your all in every area of life . “Go” has a vibe that is relentless like a mighty wind and the lyrics speak of our inner soul’s choices, overcoming the many voices that can pull us in different directions.  We say GO in order to move forward and not stand still, to find our answer beyond any chaos we encounter.\n\nMusic has saved my life, and I feel honored to share this song with you in acknowledgement of our culture of change and uplifting momentum. My hope is that this song inspires you to take action on that “one” thing that takes your life to the next level in 2023.\n\nGraphics : Lee Robson Spence\nPhotography: Skyler Wagoner\n\nGO  \nWritten/Produced by Amy Correa Bell and Les Les \n\nLook on my life \nFeels like flight \nI taste light \nOn the slide    \nOh my no \nYou gotta tell me \nAin’t feeling right \nI gotta say \n\nShe sayin ya - NO\nShe saying yay - LIGHT\nKeep it goin’ Keep on da love - LIGHT \nShe sayin ya - NO\nShe saying yay - LIGHT\nKeep it goin’ Keep on da love\n\nTell me when to ROLL\nWhen you wanna GO  \nThen we let it GO  \nTell me when to ROLL \nWhen you wanna GO  \nThen we let it GO \n\nGo! \nDance all night \nTryna show you \nThey are worried \nOn that dope \nThey salt dirty \nYou my light \nThey are worried \nI’m not \n\nEy! \nJa gimme love \nKNOW \nSend me send me some \nLIGHT\nKeep It Goin \nGO \nKeep on da Love \nLIGHT\nKeep my pen \nKNOW\nSend me send me some \nLIGHT\nKeep It Goin’ \nGO \nKeep on da Love\n\nTell me when to ROLL \nWhen you wanna GO  \nThen we let it GO  \nSashay Sashay\nTell me when to ROLL \nWhen you wanna GO  \nThen we let it GO \nShuh She Say Stay\n\nAll dat money on dat night \nHey Yah Yah Hey Yah Yah\nAll dat money on da line \nHey Yah Yah Hey Yah Yah\n\nGO \nLIGHT \nHOLD YOU\nDON’T WORRY \nGO \nHURRY\nFIGHT \nNOT WORRIED\n \nGO \nLIGHT \nHOLD YOU\nDON’T WORRY \nGO \nHURRY\nLIGHT \nNOT WORRIED",
