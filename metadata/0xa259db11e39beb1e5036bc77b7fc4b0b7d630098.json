    "description": "The most talented 66 years young NFT photographer of the metaverse in 2088 will be preparing to release his long-awaited masterpiece MetaGlass photoshoot. A feature of his work will be shooting with retro lenses from 2053. \n\nUnfortunately, as a result of his artificial intelligence being hacked by cryptohackers, digitized and launched into the metanet back in 2022, NFT's were sent into the past and materialized from his latest collection of Meta X, which has not yet been released as yet.\n\nThis meta-collection will make a splash in 2088 and make him the richest and most recognizable NTF photographer in the Metaworld.\n\nYou have a great opportunity today to experience beauty and see how these women look on the streets of the metaverse in the future through the eyes of a talented NFT photographer and make your grandchildren crypto billionaires by purchasing these now.\n\nHand-drawn \n3500x4950 px.
