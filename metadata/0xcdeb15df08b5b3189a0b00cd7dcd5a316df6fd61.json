    "description": "Songs don’t need to be 3 minutes or less\n\n“Open” is an eclectic combination of organic sounds, synths, and granulation - paying homage to the artists who made me who I am today.\n\nFor a long time, I struggled to find my own sound. Every musician takes inspiration from music around them, but it's easy to get trapped in someone else's style. \n\nIn 2020, I was in a life-changing accident. Ironically, the worst thing that ever happened to me gave me an insane amount of clarity in life & in my music. Since then I have felt free to experiment and make music that truly feels like me.\n\nHope you enjoy my genesis <3",
