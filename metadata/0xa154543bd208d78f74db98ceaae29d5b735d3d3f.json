    "description": "The governing bodies of the Federation and the Kingdom of Hawaii Island have issued selected personnel the authority to wield a Hawaii City Passport. Each Passport grants its bearer a one time claim of a Hawaii City Real Estate property (as per the Central-Hawaii-Portside-Homestead Act), as well as a suite of other perks. A gentle reminder from the Federal Courts that tampering with the LuxCorp†® Blockchain HoloSeal® or misuse of the Class IV Authority system is punishable by jail time and fines of up to 5,000 ETH.",
