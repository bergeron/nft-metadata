    "description": "\"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.\" - Aristotle\n\nVader's Art Guard is the first episode of the DSC ART WARS collection, first of the 'The Art Awakens' series. DSC ART WARS is an epic saga that externalizes the inner dialogues of web3 and the relationship between a powerful art collector & the Art Empire and the resistance led by a group of noble art creators & small collectors who want to restore balance to the art world.\n\nOperating under Imperial intelligence, Vader has a team of Death Troopers and others as protective detail for him and his most prized art possessions. In Vader's Art Guard, one of Vader's top guards sits in the shadows and protects a portrait of a young Benjamin Franklin called 'Ben The First American'.",
