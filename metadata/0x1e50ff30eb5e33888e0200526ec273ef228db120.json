    "description": "I wrote ‘worlds heaviest shoes’ based on the idea of someone who’s completely moved on while you’re still in the same place, reminiscing the memories you had. In the writing session, the writer i was with had mentioned the line ‘worlds heaviest shoes’ as a metaphor for that feeling of being stuck and it felt like the perfect way to describe it. The chorus is almost a plea for help, wondering why no one’s paying attention. I like how it ends desperate and angry, almost shouting, because you’re left without answers.",
