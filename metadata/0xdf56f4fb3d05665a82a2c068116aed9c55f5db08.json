    "name": "Frozen Princess",
    "description": "This frozen Princess is my inner Monster. She is the one who moans loudly and cries for my fate, feels inner pain and suffers and asks for rescue. But also she is the one who whispers in my ear: ''Do not remove this chain of pain, dont't leave this dark cave. We are fine, you and me, we get used to, we love it here. It is too bright outside, we will have to swim in the river of light and cope with the Life...I'm scared. You're scared too. I'll just close the exit with an ice curtain and we will stay here forever, to suffer and to enjoy...''",
