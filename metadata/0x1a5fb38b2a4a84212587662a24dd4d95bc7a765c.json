    "description": "1 of 73 of the Coco Collection\n\nBorn in Transylvania, Romania in 1989, Paula Urzica has established herself as an adept hyperrealist. Her work has been featured in galleries across the UK, Canada, and the United States. After discovering her passion for hyperrealism, she taught herself how to render with incredible detail as her passion for vibrant, true-to-life color developed naturally. Urzica's still life subjects feature upscale goods that are as meticulous as her own work. Inspired by the sweet stuff, her dazzling renditions of perfume bottles, boutique storefronts, and tempting macarons are truly delectable treats for the eye. Urzica is currently based in the Cotswolds, UK, where she collects and catalogs her favorite paints and pastels. She enjoys long walks among nature and paints every day.\n\nThis is Paula's Genesis collection, her debut into NFTs, powered by Oditto.io",
