    "description": "Be my guest and enjoy a cup of green tea while watching autumn scene.\n.\nI started NFT journey a year ago. My early works are majorly environmental art with animation and custom music (original FND collection). As time passes, I shifted interest to presenting anime characters, cute, lively and fantasy (daydream collection). \n.\nIn this one-year anniversary art, I married a good from both worlds. \n.\nThis genesis piece of the \"DreamWalk\" collection, Song of Autumn, featuring two girls from Wafuku Gen collection. It comes with 12 seconds loop animation, over 20 items are independently animated. The auction winner also receive a 2:30 min long custom music composed by BackyardBoyz, special for this NFT! \n. \nThis piece looks great on large screen, or in OnCyber gallery as you walk into the world created in my dream. \n",
