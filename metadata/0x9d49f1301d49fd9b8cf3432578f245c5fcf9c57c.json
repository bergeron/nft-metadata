    "description": "Assembly presents *Dog Days, Bogotá*, by award-winning Magnum photographer, Alec Soth. Rendered in his iconic style merging a documentary approach with a poetic sensibility, this project, one of his most personal to date, was made in Colombia during the adoption process of his daughter. In a book filled with letters, photos, and poems, he found a note his daughter’s birth mother wrote to her: “I hope that the hardness of the world will not hurt your sensitivity. When I think about you I hope that your life is full of beautiful things.\" These words became Soth’s mission statement as he set out to make his own book of the city of her birth describing the beauty found in a hard place. One of his earliest projects, it is minted here as his genesis NFT collection. Soth is one of the most celebrated American photographers and his work is in the collections of major museums worldwide including MoMA, The Whitney Museum of American Art, and the LA County Museum of Art.",
