    "description": "In the years before Christ, people of Lusitania, particularly around the city of Olisipo, were talking about weird creatures that used to hide under branched and leafy trees and the trees covered them with their shadows. These creatures were only appearing during midnight hours; vigorously creatures that could disappear in a blink of an eye mysteriously.\nOlisipo was build on eight hills and there was mysterious house on the highest hill of the city. This house was build in a way that anyone who entered the house was lost, and Frowlki, the name that Olipsio people had chosen for those weird frog-like creatures, were guards of this house. \nFrowlkis were creating fascinating voices that made anyone walking around this high hill at midnight enter this mysterious house and never returned.",
