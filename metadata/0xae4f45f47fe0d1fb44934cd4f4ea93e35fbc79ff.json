    "description": "As I was hiking near Glacier National Park with my family, I discovered one of the most peaceful scenes I have ever stumbled upon.\n\nI had no cell phone service and my family had continued hiking while I stopped to take photos, so it was just me surrounded by nature.\n\nThe world seemed to stand still for a second as I sat there in silence looking at the beautiful scenery. It was such A Quiet Moment that was so peaceful, and I captured that feeling with this photo. \n\nCollector will receive a physical print as well",
