    "description": "A member of the Peru Amateur Circus in Indiana--a decades-long tradition and the world's largest circus made entirely of youth performers—displays her injury from the town’s fame in the a case of subconjunctival hemorrhage, broken blood vessels just under the clear surface of the eye that resulted from a spinning act. The condition, though seemingly alarming, is usually not harmful or painful. This was from my very first assignment for National Geographic, shot on slide film with my beloved but long-gone Leica R system, and scanned with the edges of the slide included.",
