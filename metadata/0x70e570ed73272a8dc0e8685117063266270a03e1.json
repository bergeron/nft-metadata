    "description": "Soul suffering. A person constantly suffers, his soul is not calm, something constantly causes anxiety or dissatisfaction in life.\n\nBut these are only internal sensations, we constantly think about what worries us. But for the most part, all this is nothing, we wind ourselves up and dramatize ourselves. The world is the way we want to perceive it. We think that it is difficult - for us it is difficult. We think it's fun and easy, and it is.\n\nEverything is in our head.",
