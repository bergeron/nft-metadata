    "description": "Be self-sufficient. Have a clear and developed sense of self. \n\nBe non-co-dependent, not prone to manipulation or control.\n \nSolve your own problems. \n\nDon't be afraid of solitude, but don't be afraid of the company of people either. \n\nDon't overestimate, but don't underestimate your self-esteem either. \n\nKnow and accept your own strengths and weaknesses. \n\nKnow how to evaluate yourself, so you do not depend on other people's compliments and react calmly to criticism.\n",
