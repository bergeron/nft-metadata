    "description": "The time of male domination is over;  we are at the beginning of the era of the dominance of female nature.\nThis is a woman's world.\nTherefore, in the center of the project, there are images of girls dissolving into cyberspace and at the same time  regressing into the comfort of wildlife. On one hand, the modern worldview, even rather, a new philosophy is a fusion of man with nature, ecological harmony and a complete rejection of the standardized benefit of industrial civilization. \nThis visualizes certain transformations and the drama of a modern man, the contradiction between the desire to merge with nature, to return to the primitive pagan state of consciousness and the obvious imperative of adaptation to the new digital world.\nThis is a symbol of our time, a dramatic confrontation between two seemingly opposite worlds. \nIn our project, the image of a woman connects these two worlds, reconciling and dissolving them in itself.\n\nThe first work from collection.\nResolution - 7500/4875 ",
