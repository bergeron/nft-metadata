    "description": "Dance has been a part of human history long before the written word. From ancient India to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, stories have been passed down from generation to generation utilizing oral and performative techniques. Thereâ€™s a complexity of emotional communication spoken through dance and observed by the viewer, that simply cannot be matched by any other medium. In producing this project I have sought to separate dance from an act of performance and distill it back to its origin of human gesture and emotion.",
