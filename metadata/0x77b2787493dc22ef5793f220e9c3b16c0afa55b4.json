    "description": "I felt cornered shortly after starting my Nft journey. And this feeling; With one hand, I drew a tearful young girl with a sore throat and transferred it to paper. But this was not enough for Nft. I applied artificial intelligence to this 100% handcrafted work. I gave depth to each output in Procreate, got out of the jam with this creation process and found my way. Thank you for guiding me.\nLicense: All rights of 1/1 nft will belong to the buyer.",
