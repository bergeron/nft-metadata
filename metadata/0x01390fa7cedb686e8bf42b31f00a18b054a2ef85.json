    "description": "This work made up of acrylic paints on ceramics expresses my interpretation of what I felt the first time I saw the sculpture. In the art process I felt the need to express the fusion of my culture with music and colors and thus reach the point of Combining everything. In this artistic process I express the aura of the objects, the possible stored energy that I felt when I saw them that brought me to a point where all I wanted to do that day was paint them with a lot of respect and with an exact interpretation. , the colors that I use are typical of the Peruvian chicha culture characterized by its extravagant posters, typographies and vibrant colors.",
