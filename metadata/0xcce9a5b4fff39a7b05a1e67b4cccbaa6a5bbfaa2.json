    "description": "I think popcult describes our society very well. Above all, the relationship between real and digital identity. On the one hand, the shrill, colorful life that can distinguish itself all the better in contrast to the negative aspects. And on the other hand, these very negative aspects cause people to break down because of their own weaknesses and society's contempt for them. And everything takes place in an illusory world where nothing is as it seems and nobody reveals who they really are.  \nWhich side are you on?",
