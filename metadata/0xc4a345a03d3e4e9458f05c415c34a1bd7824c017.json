    "name": "Cyborg #1",
    "description": "CYBORG belongs to Morpho Genesis--an evolving digitally enhanced species of Lepidoptera inhabiting the blockchain kingdom.  This new species is the result of a chance encounter between a Morpho Didius specimen and a package of Wonder Bread.  Occurring in the artist’s Toronto studio sometime around the turn of the century, transmutation is evident in the variegated polkadot wing pattern. These creatures lived off chain in frames, trains and automobiles until shedding their material bodies to enter the digital realm of the artist’s desk top.  Cyborgs— perfectly symmetrical creatures were created upon migration into the decentralized realm.   Each generation grows in complexity through algorithmic interaction with one and other.    Organically randomly created,  Morpho Genesis does not evolve in a predetermined pattern, nor at a predetermined rate and has no end-of-life code.  Each cyborg is unique.  The species may survive, it  may become extinct... or jump species. ",
