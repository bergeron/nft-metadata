    "description": "\"Dasa-pink\" is a phenomenon where products or characters that are made for women with a simple assumption that they like pink color or cute things end up being disappointing for them. This is because they do not reflect the real preferences or needs of women, but rather impose a stereotypical image of femininity. For example, pink pens or notebooks that are not practical or comfortable to use, romance games that are clich√© or unrealistic, etc.\n\nHowever, I hope you like this cute piece.  \nLet's turn the world pink with happiness.  \n",
