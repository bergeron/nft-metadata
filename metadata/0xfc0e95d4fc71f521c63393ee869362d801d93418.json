    "description": "The silence we witness here is not silence, but a stillness that carries a bulk of joy that many cloistered stone walls have endeavored to preserve within. Here, the walls of the cloister are perches in which to stage the interstitial salutations of two young friends whose visit is best enjoyed out of earshot of adults. The stoop replaces parking lots, malls, & rinks, but nonetheless invites the possibilities inherent to each of those spaces, which animate the minute societies of 7th grade and stage the scenes played out at the adjacent bus stop, park, & corner store. Here, they breathe, smile, chew gum. Here they find & eat candy, crunch on bags of chips, catch the eyes of schoolmates, and generally cause the sun to linger in the afternoon sky, invisible behind the rise of projects glistening surreptitiously from the JMZ. The soaring train pushes the wind before its flat face as if to remove from it, its steady slap. All these graces abound, and surround two boys, listening, closely.",
