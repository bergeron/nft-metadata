    "name": "German Shepherd",
    "description": "In 2163, the german shepherd is nearly extinct due to its sensitivity to the 1000G radioactivity. A French scientist is able to clone the original breed back to a somewhat normal state. Unfortunately, the lack of brain stems in the clones made them a little slower than the original breed.\n\n1/1 edition - video | 3000 x 3000 pixels\n\nOver the course of over 140 years, animals changed and mutated. They developed syndromes and abnormalities that couldnâ€™t be explained in any other way than a result of human interference.\n\nThis series of artworks are based on predictions from our times Nostradamus, Kalle Ranes.\n\n",
