    "description": "Walk along the gritty streets of Seoul and you will inevitably come across marketplaces every few blocks. It seems every neighborhood has a place of its own, where you needn't walk so far to obtain what you need.\n\tWhat I love about these places is the combination of lights and grit, reflecting a very neon-noir vibe and motorcycles delivering goods every few seconds. You can get lost wandering every corner of the marketplace and taking a look at all the clothes, food, and contraptions that the sellers have to offer.\n\tThis marketplace, in particular, has a little secret, it is open 24 hours. The buildings in the background are popular tourist destinations and offer both indoor and outdoor shopping. So whether you prefer the up and personal grit of the outdoors, or the tech and savvy indoor shopping, there is a little something for everyone at any time of the day in Dongdaemun.",
