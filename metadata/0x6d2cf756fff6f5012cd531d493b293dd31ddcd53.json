    "description": "(Broken) Hymen reconstructed is my proposal to shift the discourse around virginity as well as hymen reconstruction, away from the female body and into public spaces, entrances, exits, streets, buildings, cars or ships. \n\nThe interactive sculpture materializes deconstruction and reconstruction of the hymen,  which does not exist in the woman's body in this way. ( In modern discourse we speak of vaginal corona).  \"(Broken) Hymen reconstructed 0\" shows the Hymen in its unaffected respectively fully reconstructed state.",
