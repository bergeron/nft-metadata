    "description": "The first piece I made for the Phantom Pain collection. Made while my left hand was recovering from an accident and surgery that stole some of my dexterity. As someone who is deeply in live with the guitar, and the bass, it was a devastating blow. Not only was I in a ton of physical pain, but emotional as well. I captured visually how it felt to me to lose something that was so synonymous with myself. So deeply programed into the muscles and tendons of my hand, seemingly just leaving me. Seeping out through my skin, watching it go hoping desperately that physical therapy, and time will help. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and appreciate  my story and my art. This collection is deeply important to me and I cannot wait to share more with you.",
