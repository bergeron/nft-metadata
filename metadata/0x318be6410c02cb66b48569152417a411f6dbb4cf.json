    "description": "What's up some guys!!! Against all odds, we managed to eke out another lil banger –– time to immortalize it on-chain. \n\n\"Can We Talk?\" is special for us because it's the most collaborative song we've made to date. We got to work with our friends (Tyler Hentges) and producers that are also friends (Clayjay + Michael Garmany) to come up with something a bit different. \n\nWe have loved, argued over, revised, and enjoyed this song as a demo for a while now –– now it's your turn! \n\nHope you like it <3",
