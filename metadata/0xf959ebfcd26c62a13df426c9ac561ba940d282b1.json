    "description": "“Monsoon in my city” is one of my recent works with flash on the street. Whenever it rains, I use a flash while shooting. Flash always helps to create a surreal mood in photographs. This day, it was heavily raining, and I was walking around the ghats after taking a couple of pictures I saw this couple standing away from the crowd and enjoying the rain.\n\nFor me in the scene, the orange colour stands out and there is suspense under the umbrella. On one hand, there is a tattoo of “Always” which indicates the love and compassion between them. There is another couple with a blue umbrella in the background, which creates an echo. The silhouette of the group of people with umbrellas also adds to the picture and again creates an echo.\n\nMost importantly the flash creates a dreamy mood here and the picture feels very lyrical.",
