    "description": "Temporality is a difficult thing to value. I sat still for 21 minutes and 53 seconds.\n\n‘Value My Time’ is an ongoing experiment in the valuation of my time. In this project, time is a resource that is indexed through the use of long-exposure photography. As a body of work, ‘Value My Time’ pushes back on the fast paced cyclical nature of the NFT and Cryptocurrency ecosystems, instead contemplating what it means to value one's time and, interrogating how this valuation might be influenced and implicated. Is it possible to tokenize the inherent temporality of my inert body?\n\nAll ‘Value My Time’ artworks will be listed with the minimum allowable reserve price. As such, market participants are recorded on-chain, materializing as artistic collaborators whose action/exchange in the valuation of my time is consequential. In this sense, the blockchain becomes the ongoing, dynamic ledger for valuing what my time is worth.",
