    "description": "For the SKIN series I wanted to create paintings that were colourful  and evoked the feeling of confidence. Confidence in your own skin.\nI took chief inspiration from underwater photography, free diving in particular, to see what the human body would be like in dynamic and expressive forms, in a state where you just let go.\nWhile observing black skin underwater, I noticed sunlight was diffracted by the water. It created beautiful patches  of colours  that danced on the black skin.\nI tried to experiment with more body types, In the end, it was worth veering from my comfort zone.",
