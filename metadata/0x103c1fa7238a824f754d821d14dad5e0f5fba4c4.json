    "description": "Freedom and independence first of all in my head. Freedom from opinions, trends, and ideologies. Independence in actions, choices, and lifestyle.\n\nThis is the #1 piece of «Seek And You Shall Find» collection that reflects my vision of the world not only as a photographer but also as a human being.\n\nI think it's very important to find what can fill you because, despite all the beauty of the world, it is also full of things that can bring pain and sorrow. But when \"full\", it is easier to withstand difficult circumstances and do the right things. And as the saying goes, seek and you shall find.\n\n19 May 2019, 14:26:12",
