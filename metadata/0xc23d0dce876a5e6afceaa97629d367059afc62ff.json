    "description": "The 8th drop from the Web3 album...\n\nThis is a tune about how mad Los Angeles is. It's called 'Jesus Gave Me $10' \n\nAs always make sure to head over to tell.ie/Youngr to unlock your NFT goody bag where you'll find the original demo version I wrote 3 years ago with a never heard before 3rd verse. (As well as stems, artwork and video files)\n\nThe story about this song goes like this - \n\nA few years back I was on tour in the states and I played an amazing venue called The Troubadour in LA. (shout out to anyone that was there! ðŸ™Œ) ... And after the show I was at the merch stand taking pics and hugging as many people as I could, when a really sweet couple approached me and handed me a $10 bill and said \"this is from the church\" ... I was a bit confused, but thought it was a lovely gesture and we had a great chat and took a picture. The next morning I told my friend the story and they said, \"so, basically, Jesus gave you $10 last night?\" ðŸ’¡ \n\nIt's a mad place, full of weird and wonderful people and I can't wait to get back there! \nX\n\n",
