    "description": "A boy was at war\ntrying to find himself\nSociety dictates, what ought to be but, \nhe declined he fought his every thought, his very being. He was at war, war inflicts wounds into scars and trauma. it is painful, this life a boy must live in misery, but he saw in this misery he found comfort. as faded, one day he found a flute luring, beautiful it was strange where he found it, but he blew it... \nsounds so wonderful, magical you'd say.\nthe music from it, bewitching could make you feel whole, clear every bad thought, heal wounds, and erase scars.\na boy played his flute alone, far from people\n he caged himself in what he calls solitude\nas he played his imagination grew, and it seems real.\n boy with the golden flute\n was at war with life, with himself, and with society.\nhe caged himself from all, playing his healing flute every day, every moment.\nour boy with a golden flute plays all-day\nvisualizing a better place but in reality, he still is at war with himself, he can't run from that.\n\n",
