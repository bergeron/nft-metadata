    "description": "We have MOVED. And by 'MOVED' we do mean 'MIGRATED' to another contract. In your wallet you will find the new Pass. It is identical to this one and carries all the same utilities. All information, benefits and details can be found there. Since I am now obsolete, feel free to hide or move me to a burner wallet I will be hanging out off-chain with all the rotary phones.",
