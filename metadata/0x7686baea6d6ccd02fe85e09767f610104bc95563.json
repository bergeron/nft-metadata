    "description": "Self-cellural robots contrivance their own devices. \n\nLife loses leftover heat before it comes out into the light. The last chance of freedom is destroyed.This is how atomic cold begins. \n\nThe affected primal instinct takes its own life. \nThey are born out of Acedia, drained by grief, weakened by worthlessness.

Every third of them is a mortal mutation, a soul without a master. There is no glimmer of life. Even in anaerobic organisms.\n\nRapacious reproduction coupled with the ancient law of war made our planet a small, helpless colony of molecules, fiercely thirsty for consciousness, for reason, for justice.\n\nFor the sake of his own immortality human destroys his original core, without fully understanding that he is... \nan end in itself.\n\nDimensions: 2160 × 2160 px - mp4 \nCustom dataset trained with StyleGAN3 ",
