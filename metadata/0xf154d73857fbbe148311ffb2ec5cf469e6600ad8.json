    "description": "Dryads are nymphs, patronesses of trees.  The oldest known nymphs are the dryads, born from drops of the blood of Uranus and living in Ash.  It is almost impossible to recognize a dryad among ordinary women - she is no different from a person, she even dresses the same way.  She tries not to appear where plants are harmed.  If the dryad noticed someone behind this, misfortunes will haunt him until the end of his life.",
