    "description": "For the longest time I did not feel like myself. I felt stuck. Something was holding me back and it deteriorated me inside. It’s like if I trapped myself in this small room that I couldn’t escape from. I tried and tried to get out, but it’s like if the door was really locked. The urge and desire of wanting to speak up or the need to scream for help heavily grew and no one noticed. My state of mind became weaker and weaker as time passed. Time seemed to go by twice as fast and I didn’t know how to slow it down. Within this darkness, there was a bright light. It shined brighter the more I looked at it and then I realized that it was me. I was the light. I am the light. I’m strong, bright and even if I thought that I couldn’t, only I could open the door.",
