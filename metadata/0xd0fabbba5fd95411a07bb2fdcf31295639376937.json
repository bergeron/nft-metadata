    "description": "So, you got booked by Ricardo, and you’ve now been given this…. WTF is it? Well, this is your crime report, and when The Warden (or could be Priest) calls upon you for judgement, you can redeem this for entry to the Steel Hose, and reveal your Cel Mate. Your Cel Mate will then be your skeleton key to the joys of the Steel Hose Penitentiary and the unfolding story.",
