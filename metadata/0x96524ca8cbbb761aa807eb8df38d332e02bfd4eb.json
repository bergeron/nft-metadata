    "description": "When I was starting my series **the tribes of our generations** I was looking for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and other social medias. I wanted to find the *key figures*, the leaders of the tribe, the once that are building culture and where I felt, that they had a relevant message to their generation.\nI studied Annaâ€™s online presence to find out who she is and what her believes and convictions are. I was amazed about her passionate personality. \nI contacted her, and without hesitation she agreed that I could take pictures of her. She was a photography student and we were able to use the studio of her university. \nWe spend a few days together and became good friends. I realized how authentic her online presence on YouTube and other channels was. \nThe idea for this photo was born, when she showed me the octopus tattoo on her back. \nThe picture became one of the *iconic* works for the series and was exhibited with great success in galleries and art fairs in Europe.",
