    "description": "Markus Böhm's physical upcycling artwork \"Lion in flowers\" becomes an exclusive NFT artwork. It is multi-layered and leads to a dramatic composition. A lively and energetic work of art that captivates the viewer. One of his physical upcycling works was nominated for the Summer Exhibition by the Royal Academy of Arts in 2022.  \n\nIn his \"IMPROVE\" art series, Markus Böhm works on oil paintings that he has acquired at flea markets. As part of his upcycling process, he further develops existing landscape or still-life motifs, giving them a completely new meaning that breaks with what is already there. \n\nAttention! Bonus auction: The bidder with the highest bid in the 24 hours-auction on Foundation receives beside the NFT artwork also the physical artwork as a bonus. If you are the lucky one who catch the physical artwork, contact me.\n\nwww.markusboehm.art\n\nSpecs: \n2022\n15 sec, 25 FPS\n1/1\n\n\n",
