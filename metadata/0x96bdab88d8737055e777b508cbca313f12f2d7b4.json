    "description": "I visited Iceland in 2020 to highlight the issues of global warming and ever shrinking glaciers. I struggled to convey the sheer size and magnitude of the giant ice boulders that had broken away from the Jökulsárlón glacier from the ground as they are washed back onto the shore. Taking to the skies allowed me to more adequately portray quite how large the area was. The ice blocks often weighing tones stretch for a couple of miles along the aptly named Diamond beach. My aim was to produce a captivating body of work that would capture people’s attention and make them look deeper into the issues of global warming that affect us all. From the set of images, I produced this was the most powerful and impacting image, even being highly commended in the Nat Geo Landscape photographer of the year competition in 2021.\n\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
