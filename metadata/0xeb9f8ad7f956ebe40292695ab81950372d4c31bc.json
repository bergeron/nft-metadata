    "description": "Pixel Putins was originally intended to be a meme project with unique blockchain integration utilities. After weeks of development we considered disbanding the project out of respect for the real world events that appeared and those affected. We then decided to release the project in support of Ukraine by implementing a verifiable hardcoded function in the official smart contract that sends 80% of all ETH received from minting to the official Ukraine Ethereum address.",
