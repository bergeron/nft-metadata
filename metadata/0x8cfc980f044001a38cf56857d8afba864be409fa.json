    "description": "Privacy Piracy is a photography project to questions the extent to which there is a clear line between public space and privacy. Kurnia Ngayuga Wibowo tries to knit the ambiguity of the boundary between the public space and privacy through his mixed media work with knitting threads to disguise his subject in his work. Yuga can capture his subjects without interfering in their lives; just visiting.\n\nHis works become self-criticisms to build awareness of how to defend the subjectâ€™s right to privacy from unwanted public exposure. There is no absolute authority behind the camera in capturing the subject forcibly. The camera becomes a medium for establishing moral boundaries and assigning responsibility from the photographer to the subject being photographed.",
