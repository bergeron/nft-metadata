    "description": "Good Morning. My owner must say good morning to me each day by opening me in a browser. If more than 24 hours pass without being seen, I will cease to run and become a blank screen.\n\nGood Morning is an edition of 28 representing the lunar month. Over time, some of the pieces will die while others continue to live based on the behavior of their owners. The owner's own mortality becomes a factor as wellâ€”will they create a contingency plan for their own death to keep the piece alive? The work questions our relationship with and dependence on technology over the passage of time, and asks what responsibilities owning something can hold.\n\nEdition: 28 + 1AP  \nHTML/JS/CSS",
