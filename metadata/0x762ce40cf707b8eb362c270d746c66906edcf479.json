He Was a Chilean pianist student of the master Martin Krause. He is considered one of the greatest interpreters of the 20th century. A pianist with total technical control of the instrument, he tended to disguise his great virtuosity by often adopting considerably slower tempos than normal in order to highlight the clarity of the sound and musical content.",
