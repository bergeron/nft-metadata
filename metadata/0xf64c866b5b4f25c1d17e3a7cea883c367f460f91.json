    "description": "Congratulations Receiptchain! This token is one of 40 first tokens on the Receiptchain NFT smart contract! This smart contract uses the revolutionary new ERC-1155 smart contract standard pioneered by the Enjin platform. This contract allows for both Fungible and Non-Fungible goods. This is a non-fungible item meaning each one has a unique history.\n\nThese tokens were given away on July 10th 2019 to mark the beginning of minting RC items on the main Ethereum blockchain.\n\nReceiptchain is the ownership record platform. These records can be used to authenticate physical goods as well as purely digital ones.\n\nUsing the Receiptchain (RC) Marketplace app, digital and physical goods can be traded and ownership records kept secure.\n\nMore information can be found at www.Receiptchain.io",
