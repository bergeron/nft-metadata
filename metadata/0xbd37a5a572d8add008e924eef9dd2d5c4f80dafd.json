    "description": "In this realm of mine, where the metaphysical intertwines with the tangible, a peculiar phrase echoes through the corridors of perception: \"Same Shit, Different Glitch.\" A succinct summation of the human condition, encapsulating the inescapable predicament of our existence. We find ourselves ensnared in a Sisyphean cycle, eternally rolling the same boulder up the mountain, only for it to inevitably roll back down, repeating ad infinitum.\n\nThe glitch manifests itself in manifold formsâ€”a malfunctioning bureaucracy, an irrational legal system, or the whims of fate conspiring against the individual. These glitches are not grandiose cataclysms but rather subtle disturbances, minuscule deviations from the expected norm. They manifest in the mundane trials and tribulations of everyday life, magnifying the inherent absurdity of our existence.\n\nSame Shit Different Glitch, 2023\n2000x2000 pixel\n16 secs 24 fps",
