    "description": "For many years, my heart was slowly, and then more urgently, trying to tell me something, and I wasn't listening...  This is my genesis piece, with a message to always listen to your heart, your mind, and your body.  Only you know yourself.  If something doesn't feel right, Pause. Listen. Look. Feel.  \n\nCommemorating 13 years ago to the day that I had open heart surgery to remove a 6cm right ventricular myxoma moving happily along, silently on its way to destroying my pulmonary valve. Grateful to Dr. Lucas Collazo, Medical Director of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery in Fairfax, VA for saving my life that day. Grateful for beating the odds of having a myxoma at all, let alone on the right side of my heart which is extremely rare.\n\nNothing is more important than your own health; mental, physical, and spirit.  Listen, Look, Feel. Believe what you are feeling. Believe in yourself. \n\n*10% of proceeds of this genesis NFT will go to the The Children's Heart Foundation. I was lucky, but children should be luckier.",
