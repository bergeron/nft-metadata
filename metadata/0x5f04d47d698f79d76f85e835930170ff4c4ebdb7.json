    "description": "Ethereum, Evolved: Shanghai is a collection of two art NFTs celebrating the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, a technological milestone on the Ethereum roadmap that will simultaneously upgrade the blockchainâ€™s execution and consensus layers to enable staked ETH withdrawals. The commemorative edition depicts the themes of liquidity and security, benefits of the Shanghai/Capella upgrade. By removing the barriers to access staked Eth, liquidity in the system will increase and invite greater participation in staking globally, which will improve network security.",
