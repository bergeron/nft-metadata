    "description": "These are the artisans of the Bibi Mahrou market in Kabul: Cabinetmakers, blacksmiths, bicycle repairmen, house painters, or rug vendors... They all claim to have fought for the late Commander Massoud against the Taliban. In the foreground of this photo is Abdul Hakim, 33, who owns the Ihlas store. Seated behind him are Mohammed, Badam Gul, Abdul Ahmad (district chief), Abdullah, Zoulmai, Hoja Arif, Zewlak, Abdulhakim (2001).\n\n\nSel was frustrated by the generalized images of Afghans being exported by news media. He wanted to get into the guts and marrow of individual struggles, the spritual architecture of post-war interior lives. How did people here perceive the future? How did they move beyond the emotional debris of deceased relatives, lost jobs, and bombed homes? ..... He inveted his new friends for a portrait session and together they would select an environment that was personally significant.\n\nInside a Different Kabul – The Walrus – January 2005\n\n",
