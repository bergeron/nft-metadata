    "description": "The most famous “Kiss” in the history of gossip becomes an out-of-the-ordinary NFT. This artwork is capable of evolving the first historical shot of the love between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton into a never-before-seen video created with the use of sophisticated morphing techniques. It was June 18, 1962, in Ischia, during a break from filming the colossal “Cleopatra”, when Marcello Geppetti captured the moment that many photographers tried to snap before to prove that the greatest secret love affairs of those times was real. That shot is the most paid photo in history. It has been of inspiration for many people dreaming an epic love like the one between the two characters, and it continues to do so. Today, on the day of its 60th anniversary, the “Kiss” becomes an original video made unique thanks to the use of the blockchain technology. ",
