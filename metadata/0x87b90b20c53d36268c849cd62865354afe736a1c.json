    "description": "Milena was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was confident, self-possessed, and beautiful in front of the camera, and it resulted in some of my favorite images from my trip to Kyiv.\n\nHer natural beauty inspired me to capture her as fully as possible—her form and expressions are so full of movement and spirit that I had to make sure I did them justice. It's an honor to have worked with her, and I hope you'll enjoy these photos as much as I enjoyed taking them!\n\nArtist: Dawid Imach\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLocation: Kyiv - Ukraine\n\nYear Created: 2021\n\nSize: 6240 × 4160\n\nGear: Fujifilm X-T3 - Fujinon 35mm 1.4 ",
