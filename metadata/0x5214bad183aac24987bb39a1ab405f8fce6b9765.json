    "description": "The darkness enveloped me with a cold and heavy mantle, oppressing my chest and suffocating any ray of hope. Pain had taken hold of me, my home was no longer safe. However, something inside of me refused to let me fall. With each step, the darkness began to dissipate little by little, and light started to filter through the clouds. It was my faith, that spark of light that propelled me to keep going, to seek a path towards overcoming. It was only when I gave thanks that my soul returned to me. I was grateful for every difficult moment, every situation, because thanks to them I am able to grow faster and better. Today I know that true abundance is in my heart.",
