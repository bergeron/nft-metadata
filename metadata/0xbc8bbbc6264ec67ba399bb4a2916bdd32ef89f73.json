    "description": "In the late 1880's The Unrested Gunslinger emerged on Dia de Los Muertos, searching for those who were involved with his wrongful death and murdering them. The Unrested Gunslinger not only murdered his victims, but he also murdered the memories of them from their loved ones. \nNo one knows how the Unrested Gunslinger was wrongfully murdered.... Or simply forgot....\n\n*This Artwork is a photograph of a customized action figure I've handcrafted and digitally constructing an environment using digital images and video.",
