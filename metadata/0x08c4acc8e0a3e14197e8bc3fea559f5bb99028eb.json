    "description": "This is a depiction of a Being who has attained Ma’at (Harmonious Balance) by journeying into the inner realms of self, to conquer fears, and become Heru (Higher Consciousness). \n\nIt represents Heru (Horus) - the principle/spirit/energy of Higher Consciousness as taught by the Ancient Kemetyu (Egyptians) of Africa. According to ancient legend, Heru is the son of Asr (Osiris) - The Great Black - and ruler of the Duat (Underworld). \n\nIt was taught that when a person passed into the afterlife, their heart was weighed against a feather, to determine if they lived a life of Ma'at (Divine Harmonious Balance, Truth, Justice and Righteousness). If they had, they were granted a path to the Father and Ruler of the Underworld - (Asr/Osiris) - who then granted them the gift of everlasting life.\n\nThis piece evokes the energy necessary for you to go on your personal hero's journey of knowing oneself intimately, through exploring the inner dimensions of self, to rise into higher consciousness.",
