    "description": "Hair has been fetishized and mythologised- from Medusa's snakehead to Samson's hair being the source of his power. \n\nThe obligation for women to cover their hair might also have come from ancient Greece, where medical belief is that hair is hollow and is built primarily from reproductive fluids. Hippocrates and his disciples believe that the hair of adult women is 'part of female genitalia'.",
