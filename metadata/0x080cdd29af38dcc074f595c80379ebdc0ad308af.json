    "description": "Many thanks to my reliance on metaphor, the major factor in realizing this unique work of Art intended to convey with a deliberate distortion my unfiltered perception of the realities of being born in a flawed system.\n\nThis edition is inspired after reading the book \"Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood\" \nby Trevor Noah.\n\nThis work is particularly a letter of hope and Love to all individual (as evident in the subject's life)\nwhose only major companion through Life is the mother's unconventional, unconditional Love. \n\nThe facial puzzles represented here are intentionally weaved together to form a moving portrait of a man who made his way against all odds.\n\n\nDimensions: 3383 x 4534\nWidth: 3383 pixels\nHeight: 4595 pixels\nHorizontal Resolution: 300 dpi\nVertical Resolution: 300 dpi\nBit depth: 24\nSize: 8.80 MB\nItem Type: JPG File",
