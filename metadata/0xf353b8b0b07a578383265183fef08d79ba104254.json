    "description": "Walter Benjamin proclaimed that the mechanical reproduction devalues the aura (uniqueness) of an objet d'art. \nWas he right?\nThis is a collection of 325 high-res pixelated Mona Lisas. \nThe single pixel exists in 25 copys. The more detailed the artwork gets, the rarer the copys exist. In the end the full-res Mona Lisa only exists one time. What is worth more? The concept or the reproduction?",
