    "description": "|| Uncolored Original Pencil Drawing on Paper ||\n\nI don’t want to get too much into the details of the lows of this year. But, what I will say is that I’m coming out of this year stronger, wiser, and way more grateful than I have ever been in my entire life!\nI’m alive. I’m healthy. I still have both my parents whom which sacrificed everything so that I can survive and thrive in this crazy ass world we’re living in today. It’s a shame that only as an adult I’ve come to this realization. But, I’m not beating myself up about it because I know I still have time to make up for it. To utilize what they’ve taught me. To Work as hard as my Father. To Love as hard as my Mother.\n\nThis piece goes out to the people you can count on. They are there for you no matter the cost, no matter the pain, even if it’s literally killing them. They do it purely out of Love and expect nothing in return.",
