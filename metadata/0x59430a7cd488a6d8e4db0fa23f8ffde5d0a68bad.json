LNRZ was founded because a group of friends wanted to release more music together, and it has transformed into something special. Our community has truly given us joy, and we have been working throughout the holidays to properly deliver you an electric SZN 2. \n\nSee you all in the new year. \n2023 is Ours.\n\nPerformed by Reo Cragun Produced by DLG. and Clear eyes\n(All funds from this drop go to treasury)",
