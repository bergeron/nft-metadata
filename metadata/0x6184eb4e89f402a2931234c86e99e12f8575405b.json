    "description": "Nobody could predict the arrival of the Retro Reptilians, except the self-generated metaverse (by a reptilian AI) from which they came. Their creation begins with the head, from a fountain of LSD that appeared in the middle of a huge digital rocky desert.\n\nThis first creation reveals their pack leader, the only Retro Reptilian with horns, who will guide them, if they manage to escape from their virtual world, in taking control of humanity.\n\n\n——\nFile details :\nA 9 seconds looped animation (1920x1920px, \".mp4\")\n\n\n————\nThe background music part is a remix of:\nDestiny by Electronic Senses\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported",
