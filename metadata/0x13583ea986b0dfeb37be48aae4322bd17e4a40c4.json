    "description": "The <Contemplative Space> series raise questions about 'existence and time'. The words to represent temporality are placed on the same screen with old books or printed images and appear as materials representing various human beings convey the feeling of being there. Partial images of masterpieces reproduced as close as possible to the original are placed with unfamiliar objects, creating a surreal atmosphere and further contemplating human existence.\n#NFTart    #physical-based   #thoughtful   #time   #space",
