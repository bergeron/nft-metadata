    "description": "Nostalgic Times\n\nBeneath its flourishing and hustling, the city has been experiencing substantial changes since the late nineties. Many of the things that made the city unique, such as neon signboards, street food stalls, theatres, have slowly been disappearing. HKâ€™s neon-drenched streets were just one aspect of the nostalgic story. \n\nIt has been more than 2 years living in a pandemic world.  Everyone of us try to adapt the new normal. A word living with mask. This is a reminder to dream on. Keep smiling and show love to your beloved ones. ",
