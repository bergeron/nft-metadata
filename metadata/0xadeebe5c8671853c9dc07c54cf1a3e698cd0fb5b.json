    "description": "Apex Predators is the first Edition in the Dibia and the Masquerade series.\n\nIn this piece, we are transported to a swampy forest filled with tall lush trees, slow-moving streams, and ancient sculptures carved into the rocks on the forest floor. In front of us is a man with a mighty sword sitting atop a tiger partially submerged in a stream. We see man and beast become one as their eyes stare back at us.\n\nThey hunt as one, they are the apex predators.",
