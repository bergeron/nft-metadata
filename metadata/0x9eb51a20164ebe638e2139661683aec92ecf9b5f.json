    "description": " This is a concept I’ve wanted to do for so long; However, over the last few years I could never do the piece the justice It deserves, UNTIL NOW\n\nLee Alexander McQueen has been a huge inspiration of mine, If you have followed me on any platform you will most certainly have seen me saying “Give me time and I’ll give you a revolution” that is a quote I got from Lee Alexander McQueen\n\nThis piece is made up of elements inspired by some of himself and his collections;\n“Jack the ripper stalks his victims” “Taxi Driver” “Nihilism” “Highland Rape” “Dante” “NO.13”\n \nNO.13 ended with Shalom Harlow standing on a rotating platform in a white dress being sprayed with yellow and black by two robots controlled by McQueen. I took this image and replaced the dress with Botticelli’s illustration of Dante’s Inferno – the 9 circles of hell; The \"dress\" is also made up of 9 individual colours \n\n(A separate gif will be airdropped to whoever buys the 1/1 on the primary)\n\nSHEZ (1999-)\nPROVOKE EVOKE INVOKE ",
