    "description": "The fifth chapter of Memories of Adventures. Closer to the stars.\n\nAnd suddenly it is dark, the stars are rising and it seems like night, I say \"seems\" because time does not exist in this place. The third mask is activated, she feels how the stars are closer to her hands, the view is beautiful, the air is fresher and suddenly everything is smaller. Among the forest of dreamy trees she was one of them, the only difference is that she had the freedom to move around.\n\nEach work in this project will be a chapter in the story, seeing all the pieces as a whole will have a narrative thread, but still each piece is a unique work of art.",
