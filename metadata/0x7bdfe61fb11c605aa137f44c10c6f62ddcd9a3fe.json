    "description": "1/1 Edition.\n\nPerhaps my favourite self portrait from 2021; a fairy-tale moment straight out of the most heavenly atmosphere, I can't help but feel all kinds of blissful energy when I look at this image... It brings back the memory of sitting under this tree, and the feeling of being connected to my surroundings on a soul level.\n\nFun fact: It was actually freezing cold and super windy when I was shooting this.  The wind and fog were whipping through the scene so fast, coming from up and over a mountain cliff right behind this tree, and the sun was constantly fighting to shine through. It took several trial and error attempts to finally capture the right amount of light and foggy atmosphere to create this dreamy scene.  The tree was also constantly dripping cold water droplets from all the fog and dew collecting on the ferns and branches, so I was drenched and shivering by the time I finished this shoot! ...But there was something so beautiful and powerful in embracing these elements.",
