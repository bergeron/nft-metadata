    "description": "A one of a kind view of the Boston Public Garden in November - full of colors and of course mood.\n\nWhile creating this piece, I was facing serious imposter syndrome. The song \"A Lonely Night in Mexico Thinking About Big Sean and Avicii\" by Mike Posner was playing heavily in rotation while editing this photo. These are the words that resonated with me and I hope they do to you too.\n\n\"I wish you remember this is what you wanted\n\nThis is, this is what you wanted\n\nI understand intellectually there gonna be terrible moments on this journey\nWhere I'll wanna give up, where my body hurts, where I'm thinking \n\"Why the heck did I choose to do this? This was so stupid\" \n\nAnd the reason you chose to do it\n\nWas to feel what you're feeling right now, and decide to keep going.\"",
