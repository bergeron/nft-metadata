    "description": "It was Sunday, January 23 2022 at 20:45, when this beautiful moment in time was captured. \nWhile driving my bike on the side of the Naviglio Pavese in Milan, Italy, after a small turn of the road, this breathtaking immage came to my view. I immediately stopped and captured it in this photograph. \n\nIt was a foghy night, almost total silence and nobody around. The only thing that could be heard was the sound of the very light breeze going through my face, and very few birds and crickets singing: and the movement of the fog was clearly visible through the light rays coming out of the yellow lamp.\n\nIt was truly an amazing experience to see how the light, the fog, the street, the plants, the sky with the stars, and everything else were interacting and blending with each other; it was like the place was playing it's own relaxing music, unhearable from the ears, but hearable from the soul!",
