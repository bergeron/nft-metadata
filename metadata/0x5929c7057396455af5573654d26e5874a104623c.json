    "description": "The hand, placed in the foreground, centralises a single question: what will become of physical art, now that we are fully immersed in the digital world? The work in the background depicts 'The Wayfarer on the Sea of Fog' (by Caspar David Friedrich), a man who, in constant evolution, lingers in front of the beauty and majesty of nature, but who inevitably continues to tune into a digital world he has created. The real turning into digital, so the realistic painting is turning into an image composed of hundreds of thousands of pixels. The head of the wayfarer, depicts this meeting and this connection between two worlds, the body, differently, the perception of the senses that begin to pick it up.",
