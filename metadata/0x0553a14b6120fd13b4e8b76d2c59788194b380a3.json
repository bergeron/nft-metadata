    "description": "In a still and quiet wood a thin fog rolls in.  \nThe silence breaks with the soft brush of fabric and fur gliding across the mossy forest floor.  \nA Gumiho wordlessly moves through the mists and brush.  \nMid-transformation; caught between her state of fox and human,  \nShe attracts the attention of the sprites and spirits of the woodland.  \nIn her solitude they follow and watch her with intense curious eyes.  \nThey've watched her grow up and care for these woods.  \nIf only she could find someone to, in turn, care and look after her as well.  \nAs her padded feet touch the cool, dewy grass she slowly becomes a fox again and curls up into her den.  \nHer heart dreaming of a love so great it can endure all time along side her own.",
