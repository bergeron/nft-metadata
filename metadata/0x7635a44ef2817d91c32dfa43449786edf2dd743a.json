    "description": "MP4, 60s, 1258 x 1258, 30 fps\n\n\nProject Metaweave is a poetic fusion of digital manipulation with traditional and generative art.\n\nEach metaweave is the recorded event of VJing a previously designed concept with an algorithm. \n\nI will call the process metaweaving. The first stage is creating the Source, a multimedia artwork (my process usually starts with the purest act of drawing). Then this source is submitted to the algorithm. The algorithm is manually tuned in real time. As the “weaver”, I stop the tuning when I feel the metaweave becomes a mirror of the source, with its own existence in the metaverse, a perpetual reflection and reinvention of its colors, shapes, movements, an alter ego with another life in the web. The source remains secret, unseen.\n",
