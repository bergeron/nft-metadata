    "description": "# Probability\n\nThis series of works is inspired by my memories from my childhood.\nWhen I was a kid, I spent most of my summers out of town at my grandmother's house with friends who lived nearby.\nWe all got together every day, walked through the woods, fields, and went to the lake.\nThese memories have remained in my mind and even now I remember them with a smile, some of them very clear and some more like bright blurry spots.\n\nI haven't been to those places in a very long time and I know that over time the brightness of those memories can fade, so I created these works so that every time I look at them I can remember those simple carefree days.\n\nI hope these works remind you of your memories and those times you may have forgotten.",
