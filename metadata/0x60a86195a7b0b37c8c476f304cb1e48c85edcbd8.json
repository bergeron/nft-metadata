    "description": "When I decided to be serious in photography, one of the places I always wanted to go was Iceland. So when I met this start up guide operator in Iceland, I decided to sell a photography tour to a group of Filipino photographers. \n\nThis was back in 2013 and now the guide operator is the biggest and most successful in Iceland and I still continue to work with him. \n\nThis was a long exposure on a foggy morning in Jokulsarlon, the glacier lagoon. The tides were changing and movements captured by the camera made these interesting textures and with the fog it made it even more surreal.\n\nI selected each photograph based not only on its meaning but also its value as an art, carefully selected to be both aesthetic and unique in this market. \n\nA 20x30 printed in the highest quality fine art paper will be provided to the collector and a certificate of authenticity.",
