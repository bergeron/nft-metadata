There are many ways to apply this extra sensory eye no matter oneâ€™s past, present or future but there are also ways to close and diminish its power through doubt, fear, lack and division. \n\nThis collective trusts their unwavering intuition to guide them through both light and shadow towards their full embodiment. In their journeys they discover faith, gratitude, compassion and divine harmony. \n\nThey understand this work is a continual integration to unlearn conditioned limitations, narratives and identities to realize all that they are. Each piece is a testament of individual sovereignty, potentiality and collective freedom. \n\nYou will see different beings in various contexts displaying the presence of the third eye throughout nature. The III i are illuminated by their inward light and it shines outward to inspire others towards embracing their own calling and being in service to life.",
