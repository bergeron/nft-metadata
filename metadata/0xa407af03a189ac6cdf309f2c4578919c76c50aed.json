    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a small rock named Nakarock. Nakarock was no ordinary rock, it was a pixelart rock. It had been formed millions of years ago, and its unique structure had made it one of the most beautiful rocks in the world. Pixel was proud of its pixelated design and loved to show it off to anyone who came by. It lived in a peaceful meadow, surrounded by other rocks and boulders. Pixel would spend its days basking in the sun, enjoying the gentle breeze, and watching the clouds drift by. // Build to resist // Build to stay.",
