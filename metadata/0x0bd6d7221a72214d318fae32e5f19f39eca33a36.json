    "description": "My favourite series of self-portraits that I have created during the first lockdown in the spring of 2020. Being inside all alone for more than a month, brought different kinds of emotions to this series - anger, frustration, loneliness and acceptance. The series was published in the Italian magazine Mob Journal with my image on the cover.\n\nWith this purchase, you will get a series of 10 self-portraits, and soft copy of a magazine and my personal thank you in Instagram stories.
