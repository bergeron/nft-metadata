    "description": "Original owner will be provided with a free printed version of the character with an additional secondary free NFT in relation to the Children of Dawn collection.\n\n――――\n\nCharacter Background:\n\nOne of the founders of the original crew, Kai is the vice-captain and doctor of the crew. Compared to the rest of the Dawn members, Kai is from the upper level of Shin-Edo. Coming from the highly estimed Eirween family, he has followed the long family tradition of studying medicine. Wanting to see and understand the world he is living in better, he discarded his family name and has been exploring the current state of the world until he met Kid and they started Dawn in the slums of Shin-Edo.\n\nHaving grown up in the upper level of the city, Kai has been able to understand both sides of the coin and while not entirely sure about the future, he is in search of the long-lost history of the original world that has been long lost in history.",
