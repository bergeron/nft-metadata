    "description": "A story of somewhere not here.  \nA story of a world that no human exists.  \nA story of a world that is both the future and the past.  \nIt's a large basement in the small house where the paintings were found.  \nWe are perplexed because there are lots of paintings like no one has ever seen in this world.  \nAll of the paintings are square framed and have been very well preserved.    \nThe basement had many rooms and each of them were numbered.  \nThis painting was found in room 2, but we found only a picture frame in room 1.  \nWe are not sure what the things or the diagrams painted on it are.  \nWe searched the house high and low for records or documents about this painting, however could not find anything.  \nWe're so troubled that we decided to call this painting \"#1\".  \n  ------------  \nNo limit for personal use, but it's not allowed to claim that this work is created by yourself.  \nThis art may be used for products or advertisements by the author.  \nPlease contact the author if you would like to use this art for commercial use.  \nchikizero+info@gmail.com\n",
