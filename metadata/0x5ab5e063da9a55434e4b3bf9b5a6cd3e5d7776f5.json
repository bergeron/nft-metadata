    "description": "This work emerged from exploration into bio-evolution simulation, applying research into the origins of life with the computational abilities of the GPU. We see a multitude of intelligent agents, each a single pixel wide, imprinting themselves into their environment, organically forming relationships as they search for new sources of life. Once a source is depleted, they must move on if they are to survive. This results in a complex, collective behavior in which each life informs the path of every other, making the environment and beings within it one continuous system.",
