    "description": "Free Leaders On Collective (FLOC*) are a design studio adapted to the news trends brought to the labour world by today’s era. In a moment of constant change in which geographical barriers are more blurred than ever before, the collective is rooted in the principles of flexibility and decentralisation, following a co-working philosophy.  \n\nDuring these first months of 2021, we have been providing support to the community by meetings and live podcasts discussing the challenges and opportunities within the intersection of art and NFT domains. This is also a true support declaration to STARTHAUS as a spin-off from FLOC*.  \n \n“When you have wit of your own, it's a pleasure to credit other people for theirs.”  \n\nEnjoy the related playlist on Spotify at \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/5Ejah4IM7q48qknrcajISh?si=c84397d2478e4f38&nd=1\n      \n\n      Metadata JSON: \n      https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmaoBtnXQYY5JEggFxNPcBWmCBfWbaWcqE4cQ6FawPsACi\n      ",
