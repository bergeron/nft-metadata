    "description": "Many with childhood trauma struggle with attachment issues. These issues often result in avoidant behaviors towards other people because we learned from a young age that we would be hurt. This hurt can result in feelings of emptiness and loneliness. When we need them most, pets will find us and heal the scars of the past. Animals, especially cats are known for walking up onto the steps of homes and reaching out for support when they most need it. This creates a special and uniquely healing bond."
