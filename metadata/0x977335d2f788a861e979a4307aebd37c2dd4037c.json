    "description": "A beauty amidst the flowers of the highlands, donning a robe\nMade by the best spring could offer\nRadiating warmth and splendour that bends to her will\nWith the spell in her eyes evoking a gentle desire.  \n\n--\n\nArtist Name: Namitha Raveendranathan \n\nInstagram : @namitha_raveendranathan \nTwitter : @NamithaRavee\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/Namitha_Raveendranathan\n\nArtist Bio: Digital artist and apparel/textile designer who transforms the mundane into magical using the brightest of hues. Her works can be described as surreally ordinaryâ€”be it her depictions of everyday life in a magical land or her recreation of Theyyam and folklores with a touch of mystery. She also depicts women in their safe space, filled with colours and warmth, juxtaposing the contemporary and the conventional. She fills the canvas with a myriad elements, not leaving a single spot on the canvas untouched. Nature, plants, and flowers take up the space along with mix of textures. Her artworks are available as NFTs on platforms like Foundation, Opensea and KnownOrigin.",
