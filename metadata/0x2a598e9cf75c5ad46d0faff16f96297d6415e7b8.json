    "description": "The last of \"The Prisoners\" by Time Pieces artist Raúl Muñoz was created in collaboration to inaugurate the Cryptocubans Art Gallery. Unlike the rest of the collection, Prisoner 16 is inspired by the new freedom this emerging digital world offers us!\n\n“Raúl Muñoz is a 3D artist, animator and designer from Havana, Cuba. Specializing in the use of blenders, the art of Raúl transports us into a real digital animated film, with animals, robots, and fantasy characters to be the protagonists in his works. To this stylistic peculiarity, the Cuban artist adds a social focus that distinguishes many of his works.\"- Galería Perpetua",
