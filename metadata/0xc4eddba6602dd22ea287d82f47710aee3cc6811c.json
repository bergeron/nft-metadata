    "description": "Somebody To Love is a seductive tale from X&ND inviting his elusive love interest to slow down and surrender to their desires. \n\nAs he sings ‚Äúcome down, you‚Äôve got nothing to hide. I‚Äôm yours now, you can be yourself tonight‚Äù X&ND reminds them that the desire they fear giving into is actually an opportunity for liberation, love, or lust‚Ä¶whatever they decide.\n\nProduced by Davyd, and written by X&ND and Jadyn Violet, the track features X&ND‚Äôs versatility across genres as he welcomes listeners into the sonic realm that is XANDYLAND. \n\nThe track was first performed for the XANDYLANDERS and UVR community live at the Underground Violet Rave during Art Basel Miami 2022, and also marks X&ND‚Äôs genesis release on Sound XYZ. \n\nüíî",
