    "description": "-Manifest- \n\nTaken back in New Zealand I remember this moment vividly. I had just come back to New Zealand after studying in the states feeling lost and unsure of myself. After spending a year exploring around New Zealand with a camera in my hand i fell in love with capturing the beauty around me. \n\nFrom 2020 onwards i knew that photography was the passion I wanted to chase. Fast forward to now I made my dreams a reality as a full time photographer. ",
