    "description": "Anyone who has ever lived is not here anymore or soon won`t be. The endpoint for life can be seen as a door about to close but this project stands for the opening of that door instead. It is only through our acceptance of death that we truly begin to live. It is only by understanding that death will not wait for us that we start to move through the obstacles and challenges in front of us. It is with the reminder that we are not here forever that stimulates us to make the most of what we have right now. Crypto Graveyard is not the end, it is only the beginning.",
