    "description": "This name 'Kyuuri' (きゅうり), the Japanese word for 'Cucumber'. Seeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of cucumber seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. By looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. This discovery inspired me to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition? 23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo.",
