    "description": "The open road has been calling my name for a while and it's finally time to take the plunge. This photograph has so much meaning to me. It represents freedom, following your dreams and never giving up. As far as we know you only get one shot at this life, I'm going to make it count. In May of 2022 I will be taking a leap of faith. I am committing to becoming a full time photographer and NFT artist. I will be exploring this beautiful country I call home from coast to coast in a travel trailer. My intent is not only to grow as an artist and human, but to share the things I get to experience with the world. Come join me on my journey, the possibilities will be endless. \n\nThis image was photographed and curated by Vincent Schnabl, photographer based out of Canada.\n\nEdition 1/1",
