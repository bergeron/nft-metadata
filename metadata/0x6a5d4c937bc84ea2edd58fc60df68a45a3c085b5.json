    "description": "You are standing in a small alley in the middle of Japan. It is afternoon. The lanterns are already lit and people are coming home from work to start the evening in the small bars and restaurants along the alley. You hear the conversations coming from the places. As everything around you moves, you pause to feel the moment. The warm lights glow up and down. Steam escapes from the restaurants and fine dust flies through the air. This moment not only fills the alley, it fills you too.",
