    "description": "The song tells the story of two different lovers - the player who never seems to be happy alone and constantly falls in and out of love, and the played who pours everything into their relationships without first learning to love themselves.\n\nI saw those around me chasing love in all the wrong places and putting their all into relationships without first loving themselves. 'Take Your Time' reminds us that self-love is essential to finding happiness and fulfillment.\n\nThrough this song, I hope to inspire my listeners to embrace the journey towards self-love and to find the courage to break free from toxic situationships.",
