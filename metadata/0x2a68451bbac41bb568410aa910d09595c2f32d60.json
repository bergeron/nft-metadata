    "description": "Throughout or whole life we're undergoing all kinds of transformations. \nSpaces we live in, our very own subjective versions of the reality. Life just happens, and yet there are some pivotal moments and experiences that shape us as individuals. That may change the whole course of our lives as well as what we are.\nEvents that are kinda entrances to new mazes and universes. Thorough which we acquire new forms of energy and states of mind.\nThis is contagious. As we can pass on these experiences and energies.\nSo that our subjective universe is ever-expanding and drifting. To the new pivotal moments.\nWhich happen to those we meet on all the beautiful walks of life.",
