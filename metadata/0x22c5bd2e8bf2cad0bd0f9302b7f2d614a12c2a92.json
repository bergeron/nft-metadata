    "description": "Alternatives Landscapes is a long terme project exploring the concept of vernacular landscape through incorporating a light installation, a man-made element. \n\nI wanted to create something that wasnâ€™t really a landscape but rather something engineered, so as to move the viewer in a different way. \nThe luminous square i buil: 1mx1mx0,5m hang with a fishing wire. The whole thing is done in an empirical way, and is guided by a formal research both obsessive and demanding. \n\nI Try to offer a new reading of the potential nature of landscape, of its conventional forms and its given beauty, simplicity or magnificence.\n\n At the heart of this project was also the desire to be highly respectful of the original physical landscape, disturbing it as little as possible with the installation. \n\naAs there is minimal post production in these images, I was careful not to leave any footprints around the square, so as to maximise the relationship between the artefact and the night space.
