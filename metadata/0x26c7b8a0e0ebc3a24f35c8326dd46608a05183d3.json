    "description": "We often say - behind a man, like behind a stone wall. In this picture, this allegory is fully embodied.\nThe girl's fragile fingers barely touch his arm. A man hugs his beloved tightly, protecting her from all adversity. His body turns into a rock, and the viewer can only guess whether this scene is really happening or is it just her dream.\nBodies merge together, echoing in poses and shades. Tenderness, bordering on passion, excites imagination and captures you in a deep world of feelings and sincere love",
