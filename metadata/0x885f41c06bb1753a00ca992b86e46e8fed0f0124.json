    "description": "Hudson River, NYC, 2022. This is a sequence of time lapse photographic collages generated with the Automated Digital Photo Collage (ADPC) program. \nThe  ADPC is an algorithm for creating a time-lapse collage. The ADPC compares a sequence of photographs, pixel by pixel, for areas of change. Pixel areas that are detected as different are layered on top in the image. Layering areas of its own choosing, the ADPC creates a decidedly nonhuman view, which intrigues with its logic and strange algorithmic humor.\nI’m interested in our evolving tension with the digital world - particularly digital photography and its effect on our understanding of ourselves. How do our individual memory and collective understanding change through spending increasing amounts of time interacting with digital images? By exploring novel algorithmic photography in both the landscape and street traditions, I hope to raise questions of our understanding, perception, and memory of contemporary spaces.\n\n",
