    "description": "Mornings of Mara are blissful, serene, and insanely spiritual.It's a story of my 7-day escape to Masai Mara, known as a quintessential paradise for the world’s finest wildlife that took me to another level of consciousness while keeping me away from the Deserts and Dubai Urban Tech world. I called it as my therapy.\n\nIt felt like life gave me a small pause to experience and realize how beautiful mother nature is which can’t be compared or explained in words.\n\nArtist: Kiran Govind \nCamera: Nikon D5 & Nikon 200-400mm F4 \nCaptured in Dec 2021\nDimensions: 2398 ×1611 \nLocation: Masai Mara national reserve\nDate: 08/09/2022\nEdition: 1/1\n",
