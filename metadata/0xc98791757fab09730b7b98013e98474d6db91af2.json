    "description": "I found my blind cat in a cemetery in Uskudar.\nHe was only a week old when he was born blind in both eyes.\nI took him to the vet, who advised him not to live on the street. I started looking after the cat since I was afraid of it being crushed by the cars.\n\n\n\nWhile trying to perform art with our artist friends in this photograph, he was showing us that it is actually art itself.\nIn Him, love and innocence illuminate the world.\n\n\n\nWe were trying to live in a house with my 4 single friends in Istanbul. Here is the garden of that house, but there is neither soil nor plants. It was like a prison yard, but watching the blind cat was like watching heaven.\n\nNow I'll watch him until he dies.\n\n\nUskudar / Istanbul - 2014 ",
