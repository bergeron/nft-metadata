    "description": "The path is always clear of everything except action. This action has infinite forms, including intentional or uncontrolled non-action. My way is up, and the action is cyclical and heavy. It is the form I choose in the things I choose to do. When I die, the action will go elsewhere and go on forever. In the piece you'll claim if you burn this one, the man is no longer there, but the action continues. Action is the expression of love and the whole, and is eternal. I am the action.",
