    "description": "Digital version of 1/1 oil painting made by Kiyasi Aybak.\n\nThese lovely falls are named after the Ottoman Sultan Mourad IV, Conqueror of Bagdad, which was held by Persians at the time. The waterfall also houses pearl mullet (inci kefali)-the only fish that exists in Lake Van during their incubation because pearl mullet cannot lay their eggs in Lake Van due to its salty water mixed with soda. Sultan Mourad IV set up camp in this beautiful area for respite during his Bagdad Campaign to rejuvenate and reinforce his army.\n\nResolution: 4720x3038",
