    "description": "Phalaenopsis orchids, also known as moth orchids, are a popular and widely cultivated group of orchids known for their large, long-lasting, showy flowers and ease of care. This genus of exotic plants is native to Southeast Asia with the most number of species found in the Philippines.\n\nThe collection suggests unexplored possibilities in the realm of horticulture that would be difficult or impossible to achieve through current breeding methods and also pays tribute to traditional image-based practices in taxonomy.",
