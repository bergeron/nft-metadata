Every leaf has a song to sing. Every flower has a beauty to show. \n\n\n\nBut only for those who are capable of giving an ear. \n\n\n\nWelcome to the Arboretum of Opulence, the refuge of those who are aware of nature is a true source of inspiration, a channel to tell stories never heard before.\n\n-\n\nDigital illustration\n4000x3000 px - 300 DPI",
