    "description": "This work of art depicts the complexity of our cosmos: how each galaxy is a microcosm of another galaxy. The radius of the observable universe is estimated to be 45.6 billion light-years.\n\n The unobservable Universe, on the other hand, is estimated to be at least about 23 trillion light years in diameter, containing a volume of space that's over 15 million times as large as the volume we can observe.\n\nYet, the universe continues to expand making our universe an infinite/endless loop.",
