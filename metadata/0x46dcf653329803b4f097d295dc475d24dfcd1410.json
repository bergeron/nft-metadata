    "description": "To push natural human capabilities and potential toward immortality, these suits digitally explore how fashion and technology will play a key role in enabling mankind to adapt and survive in different environments.\n\nThe suit insulates and cocoons the wearerâ€™s entire body in an environment that protects and empowers them to survive in below-freezing temperatures. While the suit is suitable on dry land and includes a pillow for sitting and sleeping, its materials are also buoyant and will act as an immersion suit to protect the wearer from hypothermia in icy waters.\n\nBacked by file",
