    "description": "An edition of seven for the team who made the TimePieces gallery such a success at Art Basel. I don't think most people realize what goes into to planning such an incredible event and the work that goes into organizing with large companies like Nat Geo and Morgan Stanley. This was a huge step for artists in the NFT space and I cannot thank the team enough.  Thank you Time, Nat Geo and Morgan Stanley. \n\nThis is one of my favorite photos from fall of 2022 near Ouray, CO. A morning where I felt so much gratitude to find a spot of solitude off the road to shoot alone in such a perfect setting. Paying it forward now with that gratitude I get to feel while shooting and again when people see the value in the art I create. Thank you for believing in me TimePieces.",
