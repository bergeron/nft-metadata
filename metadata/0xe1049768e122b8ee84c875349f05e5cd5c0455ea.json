    "description": "Flow \n\nOne of my favorite styles to shoot is what I like to call ‘Surf Portraits’ - Really close upfront images of people surfing. But even I need to step back sometimes and switch it up. So, I sent the drone straight up in the air & tilted my camera facing straight down - You can see the pulses of the ocean perfectly, the sand being overturned, and these tiny little colorful specs dancing on the waves. It’s truly therapeutic to witness from above. Some make the wave, some don’t, And I love the flow of seeing those come and go. \n\nArtist - Jess Loiterton  \nLocation - Waikiki Beach  \nEdition - 1/1",
