    "description": "This was the first waterfall I explored on a family trip back in 2007. Just imagine the sheer amazement 14yr old me had when I came up to this waterfall. I had never seen anything like it in person before and I was totally blown away and captured by the magic. The sounds of rushing water, the temperature drop in the canyon, the vibrant greens, it felt like I was in a fairytale. That's when I knew I needed more of this in my life. And I've been on a search for water ever since. Always chasing waterfalls.",
