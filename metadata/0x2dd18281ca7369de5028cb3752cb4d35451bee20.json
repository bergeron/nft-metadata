    "description": "Gallery Ghosts by Matt Bilfield are a collection of 1500 unique pieces of art living in the digital world... for now. For every 250 ghosts minted, a random owner will be selected to breathe life back into their ghost for FREE, resurrecting it into PHYSICAL form as a 15\"\"x15\"\" version, hand made from 729 painted wooden pegs and architectural plywood (art gallery value of $2000). Additionally, each owner will have the option to resurrect a physical version of their Gallery Ghost at a discounted price of $1250 through May 31, 2023. The first 250 are free to mint (1 per wallet limit) with the remainder available for .015 eth. A max of 6 free physical pieces will be made, with other ownership perks in the future. Follow @mattbilfield on Twitter for project updates and details.\nVisit http://www.mattbilfield.com for images of previous work and artist info.\n\n@mattbilfield x @Props.",
