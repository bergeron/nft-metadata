    "description": "In the 1800s, during the reign of Queen Victoria, \"nudity\" could only be used in art. Then, in the early 19th century, Germany became the first global movement for acceptance of a natural lifestyle, as a push against the shame associated with nudity and opposing the idea that nudity is inherently sexual. Typically advocating non-sexual nudity, the Naturism movement spread rapidly in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the rest of Europe, in the 20th century. I wanted to be influenced by this historical moment and create such a collection. I want you to see nudity through my eyes in the 21st century. Enjoy the collection!\n\n All photos were taken with a digital camera",
