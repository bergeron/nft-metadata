    "name": "Soulful Symphony",
    "description": "In the hush of the concert hall,\nWhere silence reigns supreme,\nThe symphony of the soul begins\nIn a wondrous, joyous stream.\n\nNotes that rise like angel's wings\nAnd fall like tears of grace,\nThey mingle in a harmony\nThat fills this sacred space.\n\nThe melody is sweet and strong,\nA balm for hearts that ache,\nAnd every soul is lifted up\nBy the music that they make.\n\nIn every note there's a story told,\nA tale of love and pain,\nAnd the symphony of the soul\nBrings hope and peace again.\n\nWith every chord and every beat,\nThe music builds and swells,\nUntil it fills the room with light\nAnd every heart it quells.\n\nAnd when the final note is played,\nThe silence is profound,\nAnd every soul is changed and blessed\nBy the soulful symphony's sound.",
