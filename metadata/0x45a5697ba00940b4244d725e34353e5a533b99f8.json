    "description": "This project was inspired by TV program about animals. Namely, chameleons. After that, I decided to take a series of photos where I can mask my models against the backdrop of various urban locations. Sometimes the background was the wall of a nearby store, sometimes the parking lot of a business center, sometimes a garage door. All photos are completely different, although they were taken with the same idea. ",
