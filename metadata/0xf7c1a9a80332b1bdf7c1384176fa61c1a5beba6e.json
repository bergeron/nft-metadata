    "description": "This shoot was connected around how the classic red light district has moved online! With Only Fans and other platforms people express them selves and their red light through their laptops. A fun concept ad resulted in some stunning shots. \n\nShot on Cannon R5 with a single red lamp at night. \n\nWith the purchase of this NFT you also get a printed version if you wish, the chance to be my Patreon and met ups with me if you so wish. You can contact me to organise once purchased via any of my platforms.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/bellaballerina",
