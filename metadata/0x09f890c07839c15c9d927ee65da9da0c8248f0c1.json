    "description": "This is an image of the biggest picture frame as it rises high above the low fog. After moving to Dubai I always looked forward to the winter months when there is the possibility of having the fog come as low as 100m above sea level. Luckily in 2021, that opportunity came. Having the opportunity to capture this rare type of image made me remember why I love aerial photography.",
