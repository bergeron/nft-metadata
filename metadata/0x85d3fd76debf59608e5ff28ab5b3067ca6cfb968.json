    "description": "According to quantum entanglement when pairs of particles become so closely connected that one can no longer be described without the other, no matter how far apart they may be. Even more strange, changing one will instantly trigger a change in its partner, even if it was on the other side of the universe.\n\nThe universe in all its parts is alive and love is its life force. We are all connected to each other.\n\n“The greatest illusion in this world is the illusion of separation.” – Albert Einstein.",
