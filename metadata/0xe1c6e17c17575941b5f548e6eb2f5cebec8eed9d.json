    "description": "An anonymous woman visiting the Alps finds herself isolated from the post apocalyptic world.  \n\nThese reimagined scenes form a prelude to Marlen Haushofer’s dystopian survival novel “The Wall”.\n\n“…there really was something invisible, smooth and cool blocking my path. I thought it might be a hallucination, but of course I knew that it was nothing of the kind. I could have coped much more easily with a momentary insanity than with this terrible, invisible thing.”",
