    "description": "A metaverse reproduction of the real-world installation by MIDABI\n-----\nTwo 10'x20'x5/8” steel plates\nSilver-iridescent auto paint\n8,000 lbs\n-----\nWhat is, is what is; the only other thing is nothing.\n\nReality exists on a horizontal plane, not a vertical one. All parts of creation are equally valid and relevant.\n\nThere is no fantasy OTHER place. This is the place.\n\nYou’re not reaching outward, through empty space, you are pressing inward, within denser space.\n\nThere is no other anything to know. There is only becoming more familiar and intimate with what is.\n-----\nDesigned for Decentraland. A version tailored for an other platform can be made available to the owner as an exchange, at no extra charge. ",
