    "description": "When I was working through the pandemic, this image of a man in a photograph had haunted me so much that I felt compelled to paint him. It was a drawing that led me as much as I led it  and the result was something energetic, but also empty--waiting for me to breathe life into it. \nThis was the first drawing of The Red Man, the painting that changed my life. An exploration lost in my archives. \nUntil now. ",
