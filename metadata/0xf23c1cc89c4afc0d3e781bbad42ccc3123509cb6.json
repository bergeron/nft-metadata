    "description": "For me, photography is about truth and emotions. Each photo of *of poems and marvels* series is an encounter, an intimate confession and a poem that describes an honest image, without manipulation. I conceive the composition as an exercise in reducing elements until the result is authentic and unforgettable. The image becomes magic by touching the viewer and transforming their visual, aesthetic and cognitive field. \nMaking a portrait is like creating a mirror and a window at the same time. The look through the window communicates the person photographed with the viewer, beyond the external beauty, curious about the inner being. At the same time, the image is like a *mirror* that shows the true intentions, thoughts and feelings of the photographer. This to me is the magic that turns it into Art.\nOur desire was creating something and goes beyond being a beautiful picture, but that would touch the viewer and where he could not only see, but also feel it. \n\nEdition 1/1\n12 MB 3461 × 4344px",
