    "description": "They say that the dawn of Tokyo in the feudal era shines like the sun's rays that hit our planet's atmosphere. \n\nThe color of the skies brings a vivid and firm palette, reflecting on the seas and making them more like the skies.\n\nMany gather simply to admire it, a view without pollution, almost always clean and full of life.\n\n4096 x 4096 PNG | Digital Illustration by Yomu Yakadashi 2022\n",
