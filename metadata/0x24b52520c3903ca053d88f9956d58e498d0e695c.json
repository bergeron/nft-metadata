    "description": "Holidays are twelve days after the feast of the Nativity of Christ until the feast of the Epiphany [1]. \"Winter holidays\" last from December 24 to January 6 according to the Gregorian and New Julian calendars. This is the period of the so-called winter solstice. According to Slavic ideas, this is the meeting of the new solar year, and hence the holiday of the birth of the Sun - the most significant winter holiday, which was united by a whole cascade of ritual actions. All of them in one way or another related to the completion of the agricultural cycle, which is confirmed by numerous ritualized actions (kutya, sowing grain, making Didukh, etc.)",
