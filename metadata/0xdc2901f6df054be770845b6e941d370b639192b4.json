    "description": "Roe Ethridge and [Zome.art](https://zome.art) present *22 Pigeons*, a collection of twenty-two new works derived from Ethridge’s iconic series of flying pigeons. \n\nTo create these original works, Ethridge scanned and combined his analogue pigeon photographs from the early 2000s, resulting in a collection of visually dynamic digital collages. \n\nLiving in New York City, Ethridge was interested in the ubiquity of pigeons. Using a high speed flash, he sought to capture them in a way that transcended their ordinariness. \n\nThese new works will begin their life as NFTs, and were created specifically for Zome’s first drop.",
