    "description": "Many millennia ago, peaceful beings known as The Watchers traveled the universe from planet to planet using portals created by powerful ancient gems. These portals allowed for trading of goods & knowledge among many civilizations. With that knowledge being freely traded inevitably led to weapons being traded. The weapons naturally brought crime & war. A war between the ancient Watchers & the newly formed NGO began. The NGO wanted to control the portal trades & travel. This led to the control of the citizens on the trade planets.  The Gem War lasted 84 years & ended with the destruction of most civilizations in the known universe. The portal gems were left scattered across many galaxies.  A thousand years later the stories of gems creating portals and the Watchers that protected them are just ancient myths like Atlantis & Lemuria. There are modern day gem hunters who still believe in the power that they hold. What was once lost & forgotten, might soon be found.\n\nAnimation, music & story by AndroidZen  \nThis journey will continue in the 'AZ Portals' collection.",
