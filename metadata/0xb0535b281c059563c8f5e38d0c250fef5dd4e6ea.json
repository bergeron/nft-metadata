    "description": "The burning of the soul from love is a fire that never goes out. \nIt is the feeling when the heart beats harder, when every cell of the body is ready to accept love and give it back in return. \nIt is the warmth that envelops everything around us and makes the world brighter and more beautiful. \nIt is the feeling that makes us fight for our love and never let it go. \n\nThe burning of the soul from love is the truest magic that can happen in everyone's life.\n\nAcrylic on the canvas \nArt size 2352x3609px",
