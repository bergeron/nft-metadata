    "description": "Living in the blinks between timezones, I’ve documented the last 10 years of my life through 1000+ microsongs – threads of transient nostalgia captured on tape.\n\nNow trading nature immersion for urban hustle, I’m knitting together the last decade via release. “Old Friends New Cities” is a collaboration with photography platform Analogue People, and 10 photographers (5 men and 5 women), from around the world.\n\nCurating a collection of 10 photos paired with my music – Analogue People has juxtaposed the realities of nomadic city life over a longing familiar to the metropolitan among us – a return home; to nature and to our roots.
