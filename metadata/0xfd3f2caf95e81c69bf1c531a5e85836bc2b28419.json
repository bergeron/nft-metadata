    "description": "Entrance Music \nAmusement Park \nby David Brandon Geeting\n\nAn amusement park is a variety show; it is a way to mask a mess. Marrying a discordant blend of studio improvisations, documentary photography, and uncanny portraits, these images navigate through a sketchy trip of frivolous entertainment and hobbyist tinkering, all while threatening to malfunction in the process. Manic and colorful, the manicured world represented in this work is more akin to a comedown than a high. \n\nEdition: 1 of 1\n\nFellowship Studio",
