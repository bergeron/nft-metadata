    "description": "Hey Sound fam! :) \n\nOver the next few days, I’m going to be releasing the last 3 songs on my debut EP, called “with friends”.\n\n“Hold on” to me represents a childlike sense of adventure and fun that I’m always trying to capture when I’m making music. It’s the only song on the project that doesn’t feature another artist, and I had a ton of fun making it. \n\nThe vocal idea here is “this is where my heart is”, which felt like the perfect encapsulation of what I was trying to say with this project. Music is everything to me- it’s where I spend almost all of my time, and it’s where all of my creative energy goes. It’s where my heart is :) \n\nI hope you have as much fun listening as I did making it <3 \n\nShoutout to Family Affair for helping me with the drop! ",
