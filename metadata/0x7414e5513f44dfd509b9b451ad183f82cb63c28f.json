    "description": "Spectral Fingerprints are bright lines in an otherwise uniform and continuous spectrum, resulting from the emission or absorption of light. Astronomers use combinations of these bright lines to identify various elements that make up a planet’s atmosphere. \n\nAstronomers have started to use Spectral Fingerprinting to look for and identify planets that contain the right combination of elements to support human life. NASA's largest and most powerful telescope — the James Web, which launched on Dec 25, 2021 — will be providing it’s first round of images of the cosmos, in July 2022,  including spectral fingerprints of many planets that could theoretically support human life in the future. \n\nTo celebrate this achievement, and as an homage to my love for space exploration in general, I created this abstracted looping sequence to represent the basic element, Silicon, using the spectral fingerprint colors from that element within this piece.\n\n---\n\n2000x2000 px \n30fps",
