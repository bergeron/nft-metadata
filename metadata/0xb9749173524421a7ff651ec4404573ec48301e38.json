    "name": "Winter Home 1",
    "description": "Winter Home 1 is part of a series of 4 animations created in January 2022, focusing on depictions of imaginary suburban homes floating amidst winter settings. Each animation uses a minimal visual language informed by early computer graphics to render impressions relating to architecture, landscape, light, depth and climate. This series was inspired by many sleepless winter nights at my computer, and the surreal tranquility of suburban architectures in those moments. Winter Homes is also a response to my first series of NFTs “Home Studies: Houses at Day” minted in spring 2021.\n\nArtwork information: 960x960 pixels, 384 frames, 256 colors, 25 frames per second, 2022. Custom video versions available upon request.\n",
