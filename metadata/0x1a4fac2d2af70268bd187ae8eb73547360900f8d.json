    "description": "Prismaterra #1 - \"Cascade\"\n\n7000 x 5600 px\n\n\"Prismaterra\" is a collection of photographs first begun in 2018. The images are created as a meditation with the natural world expressed through observing nature while controlling light, perspective and captured time.\n\nThe images are all created during the black and blue of night. The prismatic lighting is my reflection of the often overlooked or simply dormant magic within elements of our natural world. All photographs made using long exposure photography and physical light-painting in camera.\n\n",
