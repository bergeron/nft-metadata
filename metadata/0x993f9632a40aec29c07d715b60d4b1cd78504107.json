    "description": "I’ve noticed that many of us experience the challenges required to have a healthy relationship. Many artists have made it a point to share their experiences of heartache through relationships. That leads me to believe we are all going through the same thing. It seems most heartache stems from a place of poor communication. The environment for it is neither created nor maintained. That always neglects the elephant in the “RòóM.” Before you know it, the elephant has more room than the two of you.\n\nBy making “RòóM,” I decided to face the music...Looking both within and without, I noticed all my experiences put me in a position to be; more self-aware, accountable, and wanting to be my best self. \nNaturally, love, in all use of the word, benefits from this.\n\nThe melancholy piano, the muffled drums drowning In space, and the melody all come together to emote what I felt…What I know you may be feeling.\nIf you do feel this, then it’s for you.",
