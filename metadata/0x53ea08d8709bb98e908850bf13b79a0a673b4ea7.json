    "description": "A summer day like many others, I went up to enjoy the sunset in this wonderful location in the heart of the Dolomites. Suddenly a summer storm suddenly arrived, one of those that you don't understand where they come from, very short but very intense. I found shelter right in the woodshed of one of the two houses, and as soon as the pattering of the rain stopped, I went out to see what the situation was like, since the sun was setting. The storm had moved towards the Odle and the worst was over. In a few seconds, where the sun had set, like a blaze the color spread towards the mountain and the whole took on a mystical atmosphere. And I breathed.",
