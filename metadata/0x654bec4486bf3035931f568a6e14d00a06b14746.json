    "name": "77 On The Run",
    "description": "As far as most runners know, 77 is one of the fastest out there. Little is actually known about them, as they strictly keep to a small circle of an equally mysterious crew. According to various reports, 77 is pretty ruthless behind the wheel and cocky enough to take any route through the underbelly of the city at breakneck speed. The car is allegedly fully custom, featuring both offensive and defensive weapons systems that just scream vigilante. If you happen to cross their path, watch yourself.",
