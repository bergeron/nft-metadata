    "description": "Exploring the Border Crossing is a charming depiction of a corner of a border town. This area has a unique and fascinating life. The visual train that bridges the border takes center stage in this piece. The trains are covered in colorful graffiti and appear to move at an astonishing speed, representing the dynamic and lively nature of the area. In the background, the border is visible through the window, offering a tantalizing glimpse of the people and activity within the area.\n\nThis work aims to capture the spirit of creativity, resilience, and community that exists in this corner of the border town. The people inhabiting the area are depicted in small groups, each with a different style and energy.\n\nAlvin Valendra\n2023",
