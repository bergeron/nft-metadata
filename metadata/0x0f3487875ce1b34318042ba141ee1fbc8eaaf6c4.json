    "description": "Structure is the most characteristic feature of nanoporous materials, and the fundamental source of their outstanding physical and chemical properties. Consisting of a disordered three-dimensional maze of open cells, it comprises two bi-continuous complementary networks of irregularly-shaped pores and ligaments interconnected by relatively massive nodes. Intricate morphology and characteristic lengths down to the nanometer range result in high surface area-to-volume ratio, making nanoporous materials show promise for a broad spectrum of applications.  \nThe structure reported in this NFT is obtained experimentally by dealloying process. Starting from Scanning electron microscope, a three-dimensional reconstruction was made.",
