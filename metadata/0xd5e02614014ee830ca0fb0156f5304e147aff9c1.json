    "description": "Do you believe in magic ?\n\nThe Ship, the House and the Car are my magic when I was a kid, I miss when we build any house with my brother outside, everything could be our den. We built strong huts tanks, and stone walls. Knocking down a wall to see the clouds. We were superheroes in those times.\n\nAs well, I had my time alone with my father, was the time to build any Ship or Scalextric. Spending hours putting the pieces together. My father was who teach me believe in magic because he always was saying: ¨ Those who don't believe in magic will never find it¨\n\nEnjoy about this unique and magic collection 3/3",
