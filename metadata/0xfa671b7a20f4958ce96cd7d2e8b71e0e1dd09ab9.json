    "description": "What do you call it when things that should be precious are treated like dangerous waste? \n\nThis image was directly inspired by the work of photographer Joshua Irwandi. Irwandi's image of a lost covid patient wrapped in plastic to protect the hospital staff from covid was central to developing this series of photos.\n\nThis series is an answer to isolation, exploring the dissolution of normalcy as Covid made waves through our society. It's inspired by the images of fear and dread in the German expressionist film movement; growing shadows, duplicity, finality, and inevitability.  \n\nImage size 4096 X 1720  \nBlack Magic Pocket Cinema Camera  \nFrom Morning to Midnight - single edition",
