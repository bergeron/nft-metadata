Yes you can't, but it's possible to lose yourself.  \n\nI tell myself every time I want to run away from myself:\nThere are no bad and good emotions. They're all yours. Do not divide yourself into black and white. All you feel is you. Let all the emotions live. And that's the only way you won't lose yourself and burn out. \n\n(5480 x 6345; PNG; 29 Mb)",
