    "description": "By\nAkitakura_NFT\nThe year is 2060. Humans are the special interplanetary species left on Earth, leaving behind all the post-apocalyptic social collapses on Earth. The remaining creatures are possessed. A group of special people live in a mysterious, indescribable city collectively known as Akita Kura. The remaining women of the tribe, who were no longer able to resist the foreigners, \"without captivity and slavery\" or were unable to live in beautiful houses in the village, were forced to move to the city of Ajaib and introduced themselves as \"stubborn men\". do \"Reinvent.\" Now, they \"Akita\" spend their days training to fight and rage on the streets to make ends meet and try to find a way back to the clan.",
