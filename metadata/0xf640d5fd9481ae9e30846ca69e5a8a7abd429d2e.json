    "description": "\"On the edge of the waters, multiple blue lights shine across the night, independently from the moon hidden by the few trees on the coast. The same blue light seems to come from under the water itself. Does it suggest another underwater kingdom? The presence of fairies? There is no answer; only questions.\"\n\nDigital painting by Winterkeep, July 2022\n5400*3600px, 300 dpi",
