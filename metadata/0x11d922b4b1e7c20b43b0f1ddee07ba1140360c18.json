    "description": "My brother June Jissle is a genius in every sense of the word. Last June when he dropped his instrumental EP, \"June Le Fox\" I immediately connected with this instrumental on the project and within 15 mins of hearing it I recorded this interpretation of what I got from the song. \n\n\"This song is for the lovers in a little city building dreams of a world bigger than life with visions of seeing their stars in the walk of fame.\"\n\nENJOY!\n \nWritten & Performed By Scolla Fungwe\nEngineered By Scolla Fungwe\nProduced By June Jissle\nMixed & Mastered By Ashton Woods\nArtwork By Scolla Fungwe",
