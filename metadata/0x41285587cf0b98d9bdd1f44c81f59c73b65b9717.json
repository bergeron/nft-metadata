    "name": "Nietzsche was right",
    "description": "It was Monday 2016.\nI had a hangover, then a cigarette on an empty stomach and a cup of strong coffee.\nYou stood there with your bare torso drenched in sunlight. Music was playing that we forgot to turn off the night before. \n\nMy father called me and told me I was the worst daughter on earth.\nNietzsche was right. There is no God, which means you don't exist.",
