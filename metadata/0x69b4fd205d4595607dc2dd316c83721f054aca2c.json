    "description": "Chihiro 1:1\n\nThis collection encompasses the six official animated music NFT of the song called Le Miroir de Chihiro, composed by the music artist Terence K.\n\nThe name of the song is a reference to the Anime Spirited Away from Hayao Miyazaki. I wrote this song far away from home, thinking about my childhood daydreams. This song is a journey, in-between worlds.\n\nThe animation art is made by the talented artist Pink Lily Lagoon. You can pick up your favorite part of the song, staring with nostalgia at the train passing by, or being the passenger in one of the cars.",
