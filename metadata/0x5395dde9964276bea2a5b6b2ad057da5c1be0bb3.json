    "description": "Trippin Vikings is a community driven project on Solana, backed by strong ideals, innovative long-term utility, and a passionate community of free-thinking degens.\nVikings have been testing a secret potion to increase strength and the connection with the Nordic Gods. On the 77 day trial a mysterious potion was found and was too powerful to be used so a secret clan (Trippin Vikings Clan) decided to hide it. The legend says the Trippin Vikings found the way to the enlightenment and connected with the Gods using that potion and promised to never use it in wars or invasions.",
