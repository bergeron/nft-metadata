    "description": "This NFT is about the animated version of my oil painting called \"Mother Nature\". After 82 hours of painting, \"Mother Nature\" was born.\n\nAt least half of the proceeds will be donated to the environmental organization WWF for the protection of nature and the environment.\n\nImage description:\n\nWith an emotionless look she looks at you - Mother Nature. \nIt is the last warning, addressed to each of us. \n\nOn the left you can see a beautiful natural landscape, hardly damaged by human influences. A living forest at the foot of a pond. \nOn the right, the result of anthropogenic influences; A sealed and lifeless asphalt and concrete landscape, which can no longer be saved from natural disasters.\n\nMother Nature puts the decision in our hands. In which direction do we want to move? It is the last chance to avoid worse and to save life on our planet with small adjustments in our lifestyles.\n",
