    "description": "The habit of excessively analyzing, evaluating, and worrying. \n\n-\n\nMaarten Léon is a collage artist from Amsterdam. He’s been collaging for over ten years, and has developed a recognition in the collage scene with his distinctive, minimalistic style. His collages are mostly inspired by introspection, relationships, and nature, and offer a reflection of how he experiences the world.\n\nHis work entails endless explorations into the miracles and absurdities of reality, often resulting in either melancholic or playful collages.",
