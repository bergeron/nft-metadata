    "description": "In 2013, I opened a box that was in my basement for over a decade.  The woman who gave it to me found it in the attic of her New Jersey childhood home in 1972.  \n\nThis discovery channeled me into a decade of ghostly experiences.  Finding breadcrumbs, tracing the Ancestors of the Attic, and Emily, led me into a \"Looking Glass World,\" of Powerful Men, Silenced Women, Banned Books, Ciphers, and Emily Dickinson's \"DIVINE IMMORTALITY\"\n\n\"We've only just Begun to Uncover the Ties that Bind Us\"  \n\n\"KATE'S KEEPSAKES\" is a Collection of Books, Handwritten-Dated Poems, Notations, Artwork, Historical Artifacts, and over a decade of research, into the \"Kate's\" in Emily Dickinson's Life, Loves, and \"Infinite Possibilities.\"  \n\nTRUTH UNWINDS ITSELF:  LEARN MORE... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Scott_Turner",
