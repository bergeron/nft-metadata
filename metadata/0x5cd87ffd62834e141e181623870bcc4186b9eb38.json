    "description": "Growing up in Boston, I had a tough time articulating how I truly felt. I guess I was scared people would make fun of me, or that no one else was feeling how I was. I thought, maybe something was wrong with me and everyone else was okay. I would often put a shield up and was always cautious of letting others get too close.\n\nAt the time, the only way I knew how to express myself was through music. For some reason, when it came to music, I was able to let go and be completely honest with my lyrics. So, when I started releasing songs in high school, my whole world changed. I realized that no matter what you are feeling, there will always be somebody out there who resonates.\n\nOver the years, I’ve tried to lean into deeper and more honest creations and I’m proud to say that this collection of music is my truest yet.\n\nWE LOVE PT. 1 is the intro to the album. A song about self-discovery and being true to yourself and your needs. The importance of unlearning so you may be free to learn again, and the importance of looking inward. You aren’t capable of loving anybody else until you learn to love yourself first.",
