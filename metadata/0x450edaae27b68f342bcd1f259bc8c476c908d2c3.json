    "description": "Over time, I began to feel like a tree without roots, having lost my connection to essential values. For me, it became clear that the passing seasons, my cultural heritage, and ancestral craftsmanship, were the necessary keys to a new life.\r\rI went to live in my grandmother’s house, in a little village in the Ehime region. I have taken up Washi, a traditional Japanese paper technique for making windscreens. At night, I hear the workshop frame creaking, and see bizarre shadowy shapes dancing on the paper walls. I am in total harmony with my natural surroundings. For me, it is an ethical choice to stop polluting and using energy for no reason, in the hope of a different kind of life one day.\r\rThe hardest thing is the loneliness. Expecting a friend to drop by out here in the middle of nowhere is like expecting the impossible; it can be quite disheartening. In the sakura blossom season, when petal storms dance upon gusts of winds, Yusuké paddled by on the river not far from my house, his board sliding along the water, paddle in hand, his gaze settled on the world.",
