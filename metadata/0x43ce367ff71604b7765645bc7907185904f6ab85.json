    "description": "\nLost in the depths of blue, the echoes of silence confront my consciousness and call to me. \n\nThe question of where my path is going stirs through my mind, but the answer remains in a continuous state of flux. These memories act as anchors, keeping me grounded when life feels like it's getting further away. I return to them to remind myself of the solace that can be found in unexpected moments, soon woven together through their meaningful synchronicities. \n\nIt's with hope that this visual narrative helps to evoke a sense of assurance and calmness, wherever your story or path leads you.\n\nSpecial note on claiming the individual wide-screen images of this sequence:\n\n-Holders of 1 x Synchronicity token will be able to claim Gravitational Pull (moon). \n\n-Holders of 2 x Synchronicity tokens will be able to claim Gravitational Pull (moon) + Ama Dablam (mountains). \n\n-Holders of 3 x Synchronicity tokens will be able to claim Gravitational Pull (moon) + Ama Dablam (mountains) + Monad Shoal (thresher shark). \n\nFuture triptych editions will be created next year, allowing holders the chance to mix, match and create their own narratives. \n",
