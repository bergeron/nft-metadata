An architect and dreamer, SOFU had a vision of a utopia and went on a journey as a pirate to make the dream come true. After months of travelling, he finally arrived at a remote island in the middle of nowhere. There he found an abandoned tribe with no leader or structure. SOFU quickly took action and set out to organize the people of this forgotten land -- and would later become the foundation of new society. Under SOFU's leadership, new breeds of pirates we born -- but some rebelled and broke away into factions, mixing with aliens and zombies and strange creatures in this mysterious land of the Punk Pirates.\n\nAI Art Inspired by LAYC 4880",
