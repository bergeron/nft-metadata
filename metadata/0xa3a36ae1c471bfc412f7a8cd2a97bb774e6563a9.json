    "description": "I am fascinated by the power of illusions to challenge our perceptions and expand our understanding of reality. \nUsing AI, I have been able to push the boundaries of my illusions even further. \nBy training AI algorithms on images of mirrors and other optical phenomena, I have been able to create complex and intricate illusions that would be impossible to achieve manually;  illusions that invite the viewer to question what they see and how they see.\n By playing with reflection and symmetry, I create images that challenge the viewer's assumptions and invite them to look deeper and question what they think they know.\n\n",
