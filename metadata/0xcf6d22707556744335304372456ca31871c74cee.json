    "description": "The night sky shone down on the small log cabin, the stars twinkling like a million tiny fireflies. It was the middle of winter, and the snow that surrounded the cabin was untouched and glistening in the starlight. The warmth of the cabin was in stark contrast to the icy air outside. The walls of the cabin were in the shape of a heart, and a fire raged inside. Flames licked up the sides of the heart and danced in the night sky, illuminating the snow with a warm orange glow. It was a beautiful sight, a romantic reminder of the love that had been built into this cabin.",
