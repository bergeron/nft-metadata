    "name": "Tinbot",
    "description": "Tinbot was once a human woodsman who was deeply in love and wanted to marry a young lady. Nonetheless, the Wicked Witch of the Polybots wanted to sabotage the marriage, so she performed a spell on the Tinbot's axe. With the magic, axe chopped his leg off. Fortunately, Tinbot knew a blacksmith named Brokkr who could create a new limb out of tin. The witch, on the other hand, continued to cast spells on the axe until it chopped off every part of his body. Brokkr kindly changed all of them with tin. However Tinbot still wanted to marry. The witch charmed the axe one last time, and it slashed him in the centre of the chest. Brokkr replaced Tinbotâ€™s chest, yet couldn't find a the way to replace his heart. He could only offer a silk heart packed with sawdust as a placebo. The Tin Man lost interest in the young lady since he lacked a true heart, and the marriage will never take place. He needs a heart so he can revive his love for the young lady and marry her.\n\n2048x2048px\n29,97fps\n181 frames",
