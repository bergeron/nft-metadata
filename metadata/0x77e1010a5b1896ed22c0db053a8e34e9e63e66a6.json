    "description": "This photo was captured by reflecting coloured lights over a circular dish of water, while vibrating to a frequency of 24.12Hz.  \nThe geometric pattern organically appears, and this is captured as a long exposure photograph.\n\nThis work reveals a fundamental story, a representation of the transformative flow from chaos to order. It is my intention that the viewer appreciates sound on a deeper level, while being brought into harmony with the musical nature of our world.\n\nWe all feel an enchantment toward music. It is embedded and entwined within the substance of who we are. I deeply believe that we have an urge to create music, because it helps us scaffold meaning through its patterns, while pulling us toward harmony and rhythm in the cycles of nature.\n\nMandalas are universal to the human psyche. We recognise them everywhere across time and culture, all the way to macro worlds of nature itself.\n\nNotice how the mathematical ratios of these naturally forming Sound-Mandalas align with elements of sacred geometry.\n\nEXTRAS — Frequency Audio File and Full Resolution Photo embedded within the metadata of your token, stored on Arweave.  \nAccess by inputting Token ID into tokenURI when reading contract on Etherscan.\n\nCollector print — Option of 20x20” or 16x16” printed on Photographic Metallic paper.
