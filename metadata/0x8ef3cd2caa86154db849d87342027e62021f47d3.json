    "description": "ON THE SHOULDERS OF  \nby Alexis Ohanian (https://twitter.com/alexisohanian)\n\nI’m Alexis Ohanian, I’m best known as a founder/CEO/investor, but this is my first piece of art (not withstanding creating logos like Reddit’s Snoo and hundreds of variations) and my first NFT. I made it to celebrate the best thing I've ever created. My wife took this photo on a family trip to Mougins, France. I’ve never made low poly artwork before, but I’ve long been obsessed with the style. I’ve always found the process of creating art to be very therapeutic and now that I’ve made this, I think I’ll be doing it more often. Thanks, Kevin & the entire PROOF community.  \n\nEditions minted: 37\n\nMaking-of timelapse: ipfs://QmcU19PCfCTTPkXBLm2eq9X95tgmhHhiKHRJzQAxTVvB7Q/03-making-of.mp4",
