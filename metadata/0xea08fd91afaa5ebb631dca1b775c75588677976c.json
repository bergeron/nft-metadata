    "description": "The theme of suffering goes with a person from the moment of his birth, from the moment of his appearance.  To be exact, the history of suffering begins with the fall of man.  After the curse, death enters the world, and with death comes suffering.  our deep unhappiness can be attributed to our Christian heritage and the associated belief in an omniscient god who not only knew if we were committing bad deeds, but also if we were thinking blasphemous thoughts. While belief in such a god has dwindled, there remains a tendency to repress elements of our personality which run counter to the moral system of our day, and thus to strive for a type of moral perfectionism.",
