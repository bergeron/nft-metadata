    "description": "“This foray takes the viewer to a place where the metropolis takes a breather.”\n\nThis work shows finds and traces of people living in the Greater Bangkok area. I lead the viewer to places where it seems that the city is resting. Most of the pictures were taken on holidays and Sundays and contrast with the vibrant everyday life of the metropolis. Contrary to the prejudice that big cities are loud, hectic and crowded with people, this foray takes us to places where the city takes a breather.\n\n\nProject: METROPOLIS SUNDAY / Bangkok Series\n\nMedium: digital photography\n\nDimensions: 5000 x 5000 pixels\n\nimage: (JPEG)\n\nArtist: Matthias Forster\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nYear: 2013\n\nCopyright © Matthias Forster 2022 All Rights Reserved",
