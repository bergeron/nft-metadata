    "description": "Every good pop artist probably has a Warhol-esque piece and this one is mine. I applied my broken technique in photoshop to the soup can after I painted the original on canvas and decided to use only red to give this piece a very unique feel.\n\nThis is an evolution of my usual broken series by highlighting just one color into the painted white of the acrylic on canvas.",
