    "description": "When sirens die, they are found, drifting in the sea, not buried in the ground. With no earthly grave, or marker of stone, the ocean's currents gently carry them along. Past coral blooms, in shades so bright, with captivating colors, glowing in the night, past sea creatures, as they come and go, the currents carry them to and fro. With the ebb and flow, of the ocean's tide, the waves sing mournful lullabies. Laid to rest, in this watery grave, they are grateful for the life, the sea doth pave. Even though their bodies will soon be gone, in the ocean, their spirits will live on. With a melancholy melody like a haunting echo, their last song eternally plays in the depths below. \n",
