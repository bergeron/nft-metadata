    "description": "Valkyria is the first chapter of 'Tales of Mythius' the collection of tales written and illustrated by @tormius in which he will make us travel to a fantastic world full of creatures and stories. Welcome to Mythius.\n\n_\n\nValkyria ruled the skies of Mythius since the beginning of the ancient era. Her shuddering scream chilled the blood of those who dared to listen it. The Mythians told many stories about her history, but none knew the truth.\n\nShe was called the wandering goddess, wandering aimlessly and without any goal for those who watched her, but in reality, she has never ceased in the search for her only daughter, who one day decided to live among mortals. \n\nIn her sad and tireless search, the flame of the goddess of fire was extinguished, and since then, the volcanoes of Mythius have never again expelled lava. \n\nBut the fury remained latent in her gaze. She knows there is someone behind her daughter's decision, and she will not rest until finding that person.\n\n_\n\nThe original collector of the piece will be able to claim physical perks that will be sent free of charge to their home address.",
