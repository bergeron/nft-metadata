    "name": "The Dark Biomechanical Lion",
    "description": "Enjoy a unique original 3D sculpture with a dark theme: a cybernetic bio-mechanical lion, half machine and half living being. This project is a speculation - how can such novel lifeforms look - and also a warning - do we want to make big cats extinct and replace nature with technology?\n\nThe collector gets the high resolution animation of the sculpture, and upon request can obtain the 3D mesh as .OBJ file to use in his Metaverse gaming or art experiments.\n\n3D art created with human-AI collaboration.\nConcept: wildlife is in danger. Will it adapt to our technological age? A new breed of techno animals may inhabit the Earth in the future. Scary and darkly beautiful.\n\nThe human artist gives carefully selected text prompts and edits the neural network architecture. The AI makes 3D assets - model and texture and light.",
