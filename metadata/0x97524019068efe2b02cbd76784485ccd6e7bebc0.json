    "description": "\"Blinding oneself to reach certainty\", from the \"Votive Lamps\" series, is a sun amulet, which in its mobile gesture shows the desire to propitiate a space for joy, amazement, ecstasy of being and its environment. They are rays of God, they are Divine instruments. Each object is part of the research \"The source is the Sun\" by the artist Clara de Tezanos.\n\nOriginal music by Alex Hentze",
