    "description": "Travellers Among Mountains and Streams\n\nThe INFINITY MATRIX are vast abstractions of nature, space, time and the cosmic realm referred to in Chinese Daoist philosophy as the Dao. They draw together modern abstraction with Chinese calligraphic strokes to create immersive spaces in which to mind wander within. \n\nWhile traditional Chinese paintings commonly showed vast ethereal mountainous landscapes, I depart from the image of nature as object to depict the metaphysical realm - making visible the invisible Dao.\n\nAn INFINITY MATRIX is formed through an automative repetition of 5 hand drawn calligraphic strokes. This rhythmic mark marking is approached as a form concentrated meditation, a technique influenced by Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhist painting philosophy.\n\nThese works act as a form of connection between artist, audience and the metaphysical realm.  They celebrate the power of art and its capacity to enhance human experience and consciousness.\n\nâˆž [ ] \n3862 x 3842 \n13.8 MB\n",
