    "description": "Since my childhood, I've been trying to find a key to understanding the world. I tried to approach it with contemplation, reading, and drawings. However, my efforts were unsuccessful. It made me discouraged. But it seems, I found a method of cognition of our world.\nThis painting isn't digitally created. This is made without hands. It's a collaboration with Mother Nature. I trigger chemical-physical processes on cotton paper and all happen according to the laws of nature. I don't know what be there until the last moment and just convey that in digital view.\nItâ€™s a conversation with nature and this process is intangible. I've caught the moment when nature creates itself. I feel an arcane mystery of nature here and I must solve this in order to understand the world.\n\n#1\n\nCotton paper, chemical-physical processes.\n4150x6680",
