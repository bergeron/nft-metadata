    "description": "This character is one of the sisters that opposed and fought against the same cruel dictatorship that assassinated  them. They are well known in the Dominican Republic and across Latin America for their feminist resistance against the regime. Their death became a symbol for the country, and months later the country gained their independence. They are part of our history books, same books I studied and learned about. I personally have always looked up to these women as a symbol of empowerment, resistance, feminism and standing up for what is right. They embody what a true heroine looks like to me.",
