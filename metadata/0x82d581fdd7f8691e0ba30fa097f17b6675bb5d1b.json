    "description": "Ethereal reveries\" reflect thoughts, fantasies or mental states that are delicate, ethereal and often detached from material reality. \n\nThese reveries are imbued with an almost elusive lightness, evoking an immaterial, transcendental dimension. They can be associated with moments of deep contemplation, meditation or inner journeys where the spirit rises above the material world to explore more subtle, spiritual realms.\n\nEthereal reveries can engender a sense of mystical beauty, serenity and connection with larger, intangible realities.",
