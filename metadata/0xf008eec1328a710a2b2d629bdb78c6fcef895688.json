    "description": "The first generation on Mars had a tough time, when they secretly took off Earth and arrived here around 110 years ago. They learned, adapted, lived. Me and my sisters and brothers though, we don't know anything else than Mars. Born under the Deimos moon, born in dust. This is our home.",
