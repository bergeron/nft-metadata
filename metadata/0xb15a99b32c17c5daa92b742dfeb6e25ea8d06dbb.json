    "description": "Honestly, there is no explanation, beyond the fact that this piece was born thanks to a conversation I had with myself, where I asked myself, what would the life of the great painter be if he lived in this era.\n\ncoming to the conclusion that his ear would surely be part of an exhibition somewhere in the world.\n\nI hope you enjoy the weird and bizarre side of my brain expressing itself",
