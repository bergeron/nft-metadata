    "description": "Gong Xi Fa Chai (ÊÅ≠ÂñúÁôºË≤°) üßß\n\ni thought i'd do something fun and try pixel art for the first time.\n\nthis was a difficult challenge to say the least but it turned out fairly decent imo. i am planning to continue doing pixel art and become better throughout this year.\n\nthis is one of many pixel editions that I will be releasing this year. this token will be a burn-to-mint for future releases as well as it'll be a part of my history/journey of growing as an artist.\n\nit's a free mint as I am not the best artist and its a joyous occassion so it should be celebrated.",
