    "description": "July is the middle of Summer - the apotheosis of Summer. When all the solar energy gathered in a single point, burning everything around. When Mother Nature breathes deeply with a big, full chest, yes.\nDrops of salty sweat run down your face, your lips ask for moisture, your body craves passion\nJuly is amazing and fertile, hot and dazzlingly sunny. Hot winds blow over your red-hot body from all sides - it's not so easy to hide from July.\nJuly gives you energy and strength and charges you with incredible, crazy things that you will remember for many seasons\n",
