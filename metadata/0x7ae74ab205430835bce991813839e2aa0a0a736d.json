    "description": "It was a morning in October when I saw the conditions could  finally be perfect to drive to this place and get the shot I had in mind for a long time.\n\nThis small island called Werd is the home to a monastery of five Franciscan monks.\nThey look after the sick and old people, do weddings and baptisms.\n\nIf you look closely to the end of the bridge you can see a small person. \nHe is one of the five monks and walked along the bridge to enjoy this morning view after the service.\n\n\nNot only the fact that there is a monastery as well as the fog and the soft reflection on the water make this appeare like a Bridge to Heaven",
