    "description": "My 8 months old had to go through brain surgery a week ago.  \nIt has been the most horrific couple of weeks of my life and the most nerve wrecking 5/6 months prior to the surgery. His smile, throughout the entire time has what's kept me sane. Contagious, pure and free. This piece is inspired by my son's smile. ",
