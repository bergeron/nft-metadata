    "description": "Earth - The First element of Project 'Panchabootha' (5 elements of Nature)\n\nThis fusion of hand-drawn and digitally made green mandala in this collection represents the Energy behind one of the main elements of nature, which is 'Earth' energy. It is one of the primary energy sources for the living beings in the universe.\n\nEarth also forms solid structures of the human body such as teeth, nails, bones, muscles, skin, tissues, etc. This mandala was created to express gratitude to mother nature. Green being the primary color of the earth, I painted this mandala primarily with a green sapphire gemstone, which is considered to be one of the rare gemstones on the earth. \n\nAlso, the earth moves in a certain rhythm, a certain sound, and a certain note. Having that as a reference, custom music has been added to this mandala to represent the powerfulness of Earth.",
