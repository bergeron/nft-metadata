    "description": "Ordenza is a generative algorithm in the NFT crypto space that creates unique, organic curves using a mathematical algorithm. It produces various outputs, including different scales, colours, and styles, giving each piece a unique and surprising appearance. \nInscriptions are a method for creating NFTs on the bitcoin network. They allow arbitrary content, such as text or images, to be inscribed onto sats, which can then be transferred using normal bitcoin transactions. \nBy owning an ERC721 (ETH) Ordenza NFT, you also own its Inscription in BTC. In the end, you get two pieces of the same art in two different blockchains.  \nOur validation and transfer process is safe and avoids duplications. You can find more about it on our social media channels.",
