    "description": "\"Biosity\" is a 1 of 1 hand-made digital drawing of a fractaling city map. Please zoom in to explore and get lost in the details, like I did while making it. \n\nThis is the first piece in the \"Bio K.O. Sit E.\" collection. Here's how it works: \nOnce \"Biosity\" is collected, a subsequent, more filled in iteration of the artwork (let's call this \"Iteration0\" for example) is released exactly 20 days later. When \"Iteration0\" is collected, \"Iteration1\" builds upon the artwork of \"Iteration0\" and and is released exactly 20 days after \"Iteration0\" was collected.  This process will continue until the piece reaches \"full density\" of SVG paths!\n\nIn addition to kicking off the \"Bio K.O. Sit E.\" collection, the idiosyncratic structure and shapes of \"Biosity\" exist as a unique base for all sorts of other projects.\n\nMediums: I first started drawing \"Biosity\" on a whim in January, 2022 on the Vectornator app via IPhone 12 Mini and my fingers, and continued working on that same file from March, 2022 to June, 2022. but on Vectornator for IPad Pro and Vectornator for MacBook Pro with Wacom Tablet. \n\n\"Biosity\" was minted with Manifold on June 3, 2022",
