    "name": "AJ, Brighton ",
    "description": "This is AJ – existing at in the liminal space between boyhood and manhood. I met him on Brighton Beach during the May Bank Holiday, and stepped over the salty sun-creamed bodies to reach him. He brushed off the mockery from his friends, and stood stoic, his back turned to the chaos of good beach weather and the cries of chip-thieving seagulls. \n\nShy, polite, with long eye lashes, and a gentle manner. His red do-rag shimmering and billowing against the glistening sea. Strength and vulnerability; my favourite combination.\n_\n\nThis image comes from the project, Don't Push Me 'Cause I'm Close to the Edge, documenting happenstance encounters in and around the British coast. The project began in earnest during the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel was off limits.\n\nThis curated collection is capped at 100 pieces, released over time, at which point, it will be made into a photo book. This image is part of the first \"drop\" that includes images taken during the 2020–21 pandemic itself. \n\nEdition 1/1",
