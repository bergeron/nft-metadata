    "description": "A school bus abandoned in the outskirts of Moab, Utah USA. Now wheel-less, this once useful tool of public service now rests on the desert floor, slowly becoming one with nature. The remaining glass of the windows that once were lays in shards scattered on the floor.\n\nPlaces and things abandoned are a statement of societyâ€™s tendency to move forward, to gravitate towards the new and shiny while leaving much of the old behind. They exhibit an inherent beauty that is mostly overlooked, relics of the past that are left to the elements and time to be reclaimed by nature. \nThe Windows Forgotten collection by Trent North is comprised of 1/1 photos from unique locales around the world.\n\nLicense: The NFT owner has the right to personal use, public display and publication with credit to the creator.
