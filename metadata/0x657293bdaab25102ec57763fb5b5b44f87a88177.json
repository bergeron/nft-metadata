    "description": "\"Blackout Pepe was born in a dark world. His black and white face made it easy for him to blend into the shadows at night. Like other Pepe's, he too had to fight to survive. But for Blackout Pepe, the fight was even more challenging in the darkness. During the day, he looked like any other Pepe, but at night, his ability to disappear into the darkness made it easier for him to hide from his enemies. This ability helped Blackout Pepe overcome many challenges in the war, and he became a legend ruling in the dark.  \nAnd thus, the black and white power of Blackout Pepe became a legend in the hearts of all Pepe's. His story, courage, determination, and power stood the test of time and will be remembered forever.\"",
