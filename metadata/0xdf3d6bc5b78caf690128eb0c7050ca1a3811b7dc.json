    "description": "The canvas tells a tale of the land,  \nOf a world that bleeds through every strand,  \nA story of wounds that mark its face,  \nEtched in shades that shift and trace.  \nSummer comes with a blaze of heat,  \nThe sun's rays dancing at our feet,  \nBut as the land bakes beneath the sun,  \nBlood stains the soil, the pain begun.\n\nAutumn's hues of orange and brown,  \nA season of change as leaves fall down,  \nYet the land still weeps, a painful sound,  \nNature's cry, a world unbound.\n\nWinter's chill, a season of white,  \nOf snow and ice, of darkest night,  \nBut beneath the surface, the land still bleeds,  \nNature's wounds that the earth still needs.\n\nMay this painting serve as a call,  \nA plea to cherish and heal us all,  \nTo mend our wounds, to soothe our soul,  \nTo embrace our land as a whole.",
