    "name": "A Moment Above It All",
    "description": "Walking along the VI- Falomo bridge  I notice two guys sitting by the edge of the water having a conversation and sharing a joint. They seemed very familiar and I felt a kind of openness about their relationship observing it from afar.\n\nWith this piece I tried to capture that familiar feeling of openness and acceptance that comes from interacting with close friends. In that moment the world and all it's noise seem quite distant and what really matters is that feeling of safety gotten from sharing that moment with a good friend.\n",
