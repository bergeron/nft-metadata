    "description": "In quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the particle not as a point but as a cloud. This means that each particle can be in several places at the same time. But, if we observe it, we see only one of the possible states. Which means that it is possible for the particle to exist parallel to the observed state. How many possible realities are there? ",
