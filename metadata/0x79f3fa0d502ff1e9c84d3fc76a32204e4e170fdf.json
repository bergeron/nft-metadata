    "description": "100 days of war behind. We continue to live, create and evolve even in conditions of constant danger. We are getting stronger.\n\nI worked on this project to the constant sound of the air-raid sirens, and the song was written by Elephant during active hostilities in the Kyiv region.\n\nAll proceeds from the song streaming on Bandcamp and selling this work as an NFT will be directed to the humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe buyer of this work will also get an opportunity to mint one of my future works for free, gas fee only.",
