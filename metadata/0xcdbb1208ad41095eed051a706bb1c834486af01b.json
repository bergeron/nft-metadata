    "description": "handmade piece of Street-art ready for the metaverse !\n\nI have recently launched an exhibition entitled ‘cryptotag’. It mixes two worlds which are initially antagonistic : street art and crypto art. This exhibition takes place in real life as well as in metaverse (you can access it on my virtual gallery where I also present my work: https://framevr.io/k2j-qvg-kj0).\n\nIt was obvious from the beginning and from the design that all the works would be digitally transformed to produce works which would come alive under an NFT format and bring another dimension to street art.",
