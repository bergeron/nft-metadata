    "description": "Technofusion: Bridging Retro and Modern Technology Through Art\n\nOriginating in the mid-1800s, cyanotypes were among the earliest photographic techniques ever invented, marking the renaissance of photography. Since then, the art world has progressed significantly. \n\nToday, we are in the midst of an AI art renaissance, ushering in a new era. By combining analog and digital technologies, the Technofusion collection manifests a convergence of the two.\n\nComprising of four distinct pieces, each representing a different stage of the process, this collection includes:\n\n1. an AI-generated portrait,\n2. a digital negative of the portrait,\n3. a physical cyanotype piece that was created using both techniques, and\n4. a final blend of A.I and Cyanotype in a split-shot.\n\nThis collection acts as a bridge to historically preserve and connect the 180-year evolution of technological advancements in a unique way, and symbolizes the link between vintage and modern tech. \n\n4NFTs: 1 x 1/1, 3 x 16 of 48 editions. \n\nABOUT THE ARTIST: Jimi Albert is a mixed media artist who has been utilizing blockchain technology to showcase his physical artwork since August 2021.
