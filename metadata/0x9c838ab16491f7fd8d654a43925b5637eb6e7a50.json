    "description": "The \"LOVE\" series is dedicated to the intimate side of life and romantic relationships, â€” something that happened to me personally quite rarely; so the works of the series can be defined as illusions of memory (or nostalgia for something that does not exist in my current life). \n\nTherefore, the main subject of my artistic practice is understanding (and sometimes showing) what love is (or might be) through colors, shapes and forms.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will also receive 1 hour of meditative and calming \"Music to make love to\" originally composed by Nickie Zimov.",
