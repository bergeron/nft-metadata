Nestled around a core that your eyes can't penetrate,  energy emanates from within.  \n\nWhat is this?   What is it made of?  Where are we?  When are we?\n\nThis, Mother of Pearl, is timeless, and the realm of creation and infinite potential - the source of manifestation, the unmanifest.  \n\nImagination draws from its infinite supply, breathing life into the wildest of creations...what will come from yours?",
