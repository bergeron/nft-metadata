    "description": "Don't tell me is part of the FALLING BODIES collection. \n\nI love to explore the anonymity of a body in space. How can you relate to someone that doesn't want to be seen? We see them appearing in uncomfortable positions, while simultaneously acquiring a new form. You can sense a state of before and after. They're are frozen in time. These characters invite you to watch them. In return they don't look back.",
