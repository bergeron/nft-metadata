    "description": "The night visitor is the soul of a loved one who visits us in our sleep. Sometimes death separates us, but the invisible thread linking our hearts is unbreakable. Dreams act as a portal and an in-between place where we can meet. These encounters are something mystical, something not everyone is given. And if we are lucky enough to be pure inside, the door to the portal will open.",
