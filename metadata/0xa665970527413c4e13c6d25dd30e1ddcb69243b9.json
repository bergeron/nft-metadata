    "description": "“Abstract Fragmentation”\n\nSHOEFITI : A “Soleful” Exploration\n\nFor many, the concept of shoes hanging from a power line is one shrouded in misconceptions.\n\nIs it an inner-city act of defiance?  \nIs it a celebratory act of unity?  \nOr is it simply an adolescent right of passage?\n\nSHOEFITI (shoes+graffiti) can consist of all of these things, and more.\n\nThe purpose of this collection is to destigmatize the perception of SHOEFITI while bringing to the forefront the artistic and creative elements the act evokes.\n\nWe look to the sky, and dangling freely, is a reflection of culture; a reflection of a moment; a reflection of one’s self.",
