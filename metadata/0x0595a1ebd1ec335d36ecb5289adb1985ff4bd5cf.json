    "description": "I was taking pictures by the lake in Selçuk district of İzmir. It was a hot day and I was very tired. I went to the village to rest.\nJust then, a playing boy ran to his mother. His mother started to make him drink water with his hands. I stumbled upon a wonderful moment that showed her motherhood. I was very happy to have photographed a very emotional moment. Then, of course, we played ball with that boy.\n\nThis photograph was included in the Turkish National Team, which was selected to the 34th International FIAP \"Motherhood\" Themed Black and White Photo Printing Division in 2018.\n\nThe Turkish team won the Bronze Medal as the fourth in the world.\n\n\nArtis: Seckin Yenici\n Edition: 1/1\nCamera: Canon EOS 5D Mark II \nDate: 2011\nFile: jpeg 300 dpi\nLocation: İzmir / Türkiye\nImage Size: 3400x 2400",
