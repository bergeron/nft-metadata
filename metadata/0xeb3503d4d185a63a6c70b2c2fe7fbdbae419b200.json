    "description": "Even though life occasionally tears your heart to pieces, life will always be beautiful with its various plots that will never obey any souls. \n\nWe can recognize happiness when we ever met sadness.\nWe can interpret a warm heart in the middle of cold days.\nWe can be grateful for success after we give a handshake into the hard moments in our life.\nWe can realize how precious a dim light is in the middle of the dark.\nAnd maybe we can understand that there is always something blooming in every loss.\n\n\nThe balance of light and dark creates feelings for one another. \nBrings us to the bittersweet irony of life which slowly makes this journey like a colorful array in harmony. \n\nHarmony in the irony of life",
