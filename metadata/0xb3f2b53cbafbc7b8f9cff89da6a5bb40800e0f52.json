    "description": "Activate the sound to start this journey:\n\nThere are days, times when we do not recognize ourselves because we are changing, because we are mutating, our skin falls off and another one is born. \n\nA gaze insists on being born, to recognize itself in other eyes that are its own but changing, but different. I disassemble myself, I distill myself, I return to the origin: to the pixel, to silence, to be born again and to continue being.\n\nThis work is a portal to that multiple, contradictory, intimate moment. \nWe invite you to look at yourself in this story of transformation. \n\n\"Through this window\nI look out into another\ndetained in memory\n\nIt is urgent\nTo dream another desire\"\n",
