    "description": "The water of her womb, your first bath, your first home was her body. The body that pulled apart to welcome you to the world. She watches you grow even in her discomfort. the first essence of life was her love.\n\nHer heart she gave you when yours fell apart, you are her soft miracle, a joy that cuts across all bonds. Your first sight of relief was her twinkling eyes.\n\nYou carry your mother in your eyes, you carry all her strength and uniqueness. Make her proud of all she watches you do.",
