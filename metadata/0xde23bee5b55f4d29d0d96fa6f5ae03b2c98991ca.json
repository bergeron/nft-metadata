    "description": "This is a poster from my large collection called\n\" Yellow Posters \"\n\nThe poster “Peace Not War” has a dual approach\n“In first place the bird is the expression and a symbol of peace but it also indicates an oncoming war and represents the community in crisis and during war times. The second interpretation/approach talks about the people who are living in captivity of war, those who can’t move or get away from this horrible situation”.",
