    "description": "Mercilessly foretelling, no lack of words for impetuous chatter. \nRuling spirit of his body. \nTotalitarian adversary of any nefarious contract to decay. Manifestation of truth made law. Heavenly power brought to earthly cause. \n\nOwner of the sacred tongue, he works upon the elements.\n\nWith him, you will waver glory to the beat of his illusion, which will carry your light.",
