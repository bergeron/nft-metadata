    "description": "Still by day. Alive by night. This artwork tracks your local sunrise & sunset, creating a masterpiece that experiences time, just as you do.  \n---  \nThe blue skies, now fill her eyes,  \nAs she looks for traces of him,  \nA longing for love, it just defies,  \nAs signs of approach look slim.  \n\nBut she won't move or budge,  \nSo long as the sun still shines,  \nMove she does and come alive,  \nIn darkness, her heart it pines.\n\nHer love is only as incomplete,  \nAs it is strong and sure and firm,  \nBut she can't live, just all alone,  \nFor her fears, they'll all confirm.  \n\nSome say that love is a luxury,  \nAnd others say it's only fleeting,  \nBut for her it sure as day is just,  \nMade true, with all her waiting.  \n\nWritten by Digipedia, 2022  \n\n[View Fullscreen](https://transient-labs.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRqsyZbr9KKGi5Dx64FBhwC5PymdCbHWQbPPk82XD2Jbp)  \n\nPowered by Transient Labs",
