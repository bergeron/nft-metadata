    "description": "On January 9, 2009, the first open source bitcoin client, hosted at SourceForge, was released.\nThis mandala represents the birth of Bitcoin on that exact date. His glorious path has grown rapidly to become a significant store of value both online and offline in this vibrant economic landscape; his ups and downs are spectacular, like the glitter and dimness behind all things, with more surprises along the way.\nAs a thank you for their efforts in making communications secure and evading government censorship, as well as protecting human rights to privacy, 50% of the proceeds from this auction will be donated to @torproject.org.\n\nGIF file 1500x1125",
