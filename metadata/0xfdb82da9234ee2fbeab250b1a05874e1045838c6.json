    "description": "Death is being reborn \nFully awake into the memories \nOf our complete life \n\nWalking again these same moments\nKnowing where each rain drop will land \n\nAt first we scream at ourselves\n“Let her go!” \nAnd of course we cannot hear\n\nNow we linger \nNotice the wind blow her hair\nNotice she averts her eyes\nNotice we aren’t noticing \n\nNow we let the vase fall\nAgain and again and again \nFlowers and water spill everywhere\n\nall exquisite moments unfold\nand finally we are free. \n\nBeautiful Zach Braiker poem for this art\n\n13 Seconds loop\n60 fps\n",
