    "description": "After we took the burnt-down bike into the studio, I photographed it´s parts with a medium format film camera. It was the perfect way to capture all the detail of the burnt wreck: the dangling turn signal, the heat-peeled paint, the wires, the ash. \nIt´s a perfect demonstration of the juxtaposition of beauty in destruction.\nThis image acts as 1/3 of a triptychon, together with the mid- and the rear-part of the bike.\n\nMamiya RZ67, Portra400",
