    "description": "AI combined with the creative mind and articulation of Tana Marie. \n\nHaving the opportunity to be able to create the beautiful images I imagine by doing one of my favorite hobbies, writing, is absolutely beautiful, especially for someone like myself, who can't draw or paint for hours on end like I used to. \nBut having that knowledge, takes this image to entire new level. Taking the AI assisted image into photoshop, adding details and manipulations I enjoy, without my hands locking up and being in excruciating pain, is so fucking beautiful. \n\nAnd I hope to inspire more people to see the beauty within the technology we have access to.",
