    "description": "Nine Of Arrows\n\nThe spiritual warrior dedicates their arrows of inspiration by playing the bow as an instrument of summoning. The inner oath helps keep one on a balanced footing by dedicating skills to a greater good.\n\nTo heed the calling to dedicate one’s life to any skill, spiritual path, belief system or philosophy requires sincerity, self-discipline, and hard work. It is a sacred summoning that requires time and effort... For those who hear the calling and become spiritual warriors and protectors of the land, responsibility and sacrifice are also required. To teach by example the value of respecting other’s beliefs and philosophies in honoring the land is immensely important. Sometimes a simple daily ritual reminds us of the oath we have taken to conserve and protect the environment. Dedicate yourself to the task of preserving the land and be a part of making a difference.\n\n~ from Wild Wood Tarot, by Mark Ryan and John Matthews\n\nMusic by Shaolun\nArtwork by Postwook\n3250 × 4000 mp4",
