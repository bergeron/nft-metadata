    "description": "This 1:1 Dark Side Elephant I recreated using Adobe Illustrator and is the first piece in my collection called 'rent'. The original picture was drawn with a pen and I took that image and lowered the opacity on AI to create this and one other with a White background. \n\nIn 2014 I was working at Yard House in Denver, CO as a host. This was at a point in my life where I was a different person, it's been a juggling act to get to where I'm at today. Elephants are some of the most intelligent and delicate creatures, something I admire very much. \n\nThis is my first piece I'm putting up for sale in a space that for some reason keeps pulling me in even when everything is telling me to leave.\n\nðŸ’™",
