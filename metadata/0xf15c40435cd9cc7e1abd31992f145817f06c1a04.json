    "description": "Photographs on my iPhone, Instagram story editor, 3D modelling on Rhino, drawing on photoshop, re-thinking memes and hand drawing, is what comes together to form the works in this show.\n\nEach work in the show has at least a two-point autobiographical narrative. First, itâ€™s a photograph that will inform the future of the composition. These photographs are taken during a trigger moment. A moment of deep contemplation, ecstasy, or any strong emotion. Then a new layer, of a lighter story, embellishes the photograph on the Instagram story editor. Parts of this first edit gets 3D modelled and rendered without materiality on Rhinoceros. The final layer on Photoshop, which is purely a drawing over the work created up to that point, comes to inform the work with a new narrative inspired by a second time specific event. This 4-point digital manipulation composition, finds its best life, stored on the blockchain as an NFT. \n",
