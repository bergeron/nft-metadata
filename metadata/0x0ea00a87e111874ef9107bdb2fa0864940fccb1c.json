    "description": "The wave:\nImagine being miles from land in a 6m swell watching 5 of your best mates get the waves of their lives. This image captures that moment for me, it's no secret that “the right” gets busy but this day was so special to me because it was shared with my closest friends. The ocean was wild that day, filled with strong cross shore winds and rain storms. Lucky for me, I was able to capture this incredible moment.\n\nThe edit:\nJust like the photograph, this edit is created between two artists who became friends through their passion for art. What started as an idea of a lone wave flowing through a moody environment quickly became a reality. Teaming up with Ren, Kai was able to turn his vision into a visual piece. A blue dominant edit where the details of the image depended solely upon contrast. The focus of this image is to highlight the massive wave spanning horizontally while a tiny surfer by the name of Dave attempted to conquer it. \n\nA collaboration between RenMcgann & Kaiyhun",
