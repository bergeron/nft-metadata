    "description": "\"We'll find the truth within unity\" - I quote my grandfather as he passed yet another cryptic lesson onto me. \nHow was the younger, na√Øve me supposed to know that this riddle would eventually become my inevitable legacy? \n\nDestruction, loss, and grief is all we've brought to the world knowing merely a fraction of what the truth is. I await the moment when we notice how we're a witness to the greatest jigsaw ever forged. \n\nSlivers of truth dwelling deep within our puzzle pieces yet we fail to loosen the grip on our beliefs to gather others. How are we mortals supposed to complete the picture when we are unwilling to share or accept? \n\nSecrets of the universe and eternal peace lay unburied endlessly waiting for one who only needs to listen and observe.\n\nAs a tribute to the mentors who bestowed the lessons onto me, I shall ask those cryptic questions yet again. \n\nYou've been ushered into a dilemma - Will you bound yourself with your piece? Or will you reach out to complete the picture?  ",
