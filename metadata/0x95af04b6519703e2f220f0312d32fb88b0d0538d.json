    "description": "Hats have always fascinated me and this particular shop in London, with its colourful fedoras, is a true dream for a street photographer! I was there with my camera and when I saw this man stopping, wearing his own fedora , probably to dream of some more hats, I immediately knew this was my \"decisive moment\" and this shot was born.  \n\"Dreaming of hats\" was taken in London in 2022.
