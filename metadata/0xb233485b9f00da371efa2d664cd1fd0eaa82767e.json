    "description": "Every Killer Capsule, displayed in the signature black and orange Halloween colorway, contains two interoperable, digital wearables: a Kill Team T-shirt and a Kill Team snapback hat. The snapback hat comes with a DRx Prescription that can be filled in the Drug Store (drx.store) for a real-life, physical version of the snapback hat. The DRx Prescription has an expiration date of May 31, 2023. Any Killer Capsules dissolved after May 31, 2023 will still include both digital wearables but they will no longer include the a DRx Prescription for a physical hat.\n\nSee all of the revealed items from the Kill Team Halloween Collection. https://opensea.io/collection/drx-kill-team-collection\n                    ",
