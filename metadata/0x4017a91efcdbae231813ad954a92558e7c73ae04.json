    "description": "Hands can be as expressive as a portrait . They can convey all sorts of feelings, emotions or tell stories. I am fascinated by their particular language and the differences and similarities of that language between cultures. \n\nI studied hand sign language in Spanish many years ago and I fell in love with it. Since then, I have built a collection of hand drawn studies that I wish touches your soul somehow. I use color pencils to try to catch their emotion, their essence in the way they speak to me.\n\nWhat story do these hands convey to you? What emotions? \n\n\n\nⒸ Raquel Casilda",
