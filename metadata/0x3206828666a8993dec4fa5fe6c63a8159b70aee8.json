    "name": "The Next Normal",
    "description": "The Next Normal symbolises the next chapter of our life, a new beginning, a new genre in the art world, the post pandemic contemporary art. Mixture of different styles and cultures in one work. \n\nThis is a handwritten calligraffiti influenced by the letters in ancient scripts of Gothic, Aramaic, Arabic, Cyrillic, Sanskrit, Iban (native Borneo) scripts and others combined elements to form this masterpiece. The rhythm of letters in this work is flowing almost like abstract or asemic writing leaving you the appreciation space for open interpretation of its meaning. \n\nThe aim is to bridge these letterforms of different culture into one. It is to show the power of unity and how collaboration is the next normal of our future. \n\nThis is Letterhythm's Genesis on Foundation. ",
