    "description": "This is a commemorative token minted to celebrate the release of the Informal Symmetry series, minted on my personal manifold contract on 22-11-2022.\n\n\"Informal Symmetry explores the relationship between rules and feeling when it comes to human expression. Mankind has been fascinated with understanding beauty and trying to find a ruleset that can guarantee success. But whenever a ruleset becomes the standard, man tends to break out of it. That beckons the question, does beauty lie in our concrete understanding of the natural world, or our approximation and appreciation of it?\"\n\nThe full series can be seen here: \nhttps://superrare.com/0x81cf49e7acac042a2691f0eb3917733d88cd45a0/informal-symmetry:-balance-5  \nhttps://superrare.com/0x81cf49e7acac042a2691f0eb3917733d88cd45a0/informal-symmetry:-offset-6  \nhttps://superrare.com/0x81cf49e7acac042a2691f0eb3917733d88cd45a0/informal-symmetry:-focus-7\n\n",
