    "name": "Welcome to Portland",
    "description": "Portland, Oregon is also known as \"Rip City\" a moniker donated to the city by the late Bill Schonely, the play-by-play announcer for the hometown Portland Trailblazers. It was first used in 1971 in a game against the Lakers.\n\nPortland is my hometown, it is where I grew up and first learned photography in the 1990s. This collection is a dedication to many years spent in my youth looking for great spots to photograph the night life. \n\nThis collection includes only four images, but the connection to the rest of my work is undeniable. This represents my editing in digital work, tying the past with the present and the future. It is the glue that connects my previous collections on OpenSea to what I will create in the future.",
