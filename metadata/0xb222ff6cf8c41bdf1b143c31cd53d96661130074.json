    "description": "This is the second collection that I make in collaboration with D.Mogeon. She illustrated each poem beautifully, but in this case, she also created the wonderful melodies, depicting a perfect and harmonious environment.\nOur aim is to take each person who dives into the experience of these quantum poems into a journey within themselves. \nI want people to rewrite their own empty spaces with the knowledge that we can change the way we see the world every second of the way.\n",
