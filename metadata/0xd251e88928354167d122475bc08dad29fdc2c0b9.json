    "description": "“We breathe” is a commentary on the state of the fashion industry exploring how models are stripped of their opinions, sexuality, and somewhat their souls. Walking like zombies with blank expressions on the runway then blooming into a full glamour pose on command. Only then to retire backstage to stand perfectly still and bare in plain sight for a change of hair, makeup, and wardrobe. Cue the next loop…\n\nThis exploratory journey took me to Bali where I connected with Lilly (aka @soulthesea_) and these pieces came to life.\n\nQuality: 4K\n\nPrints are available on: https://www.waleedshah.ae/shop\n\nPrints work with Artivive to overlay the animation onto the static print",
