    "description": "In the distant future, AI has taken over.\n\n'Many new inhabitants from all over the galaxy roam our lands and consume our skies. \nLooming behind almost every cloud in the southern hemisphere, You will catch a glimpse of a Xenomorph structure.' \n\nIn this collection there art 4 unique captures of a Xenobase. \n\nEach artwork is AI generated in batches of 20, Where one will make the cut and 19 will be discarded.\nThen the photoshopping starts. Colour adjustments, masking, boosting contrasts, adding, deleting, shading, etc. Until the finished piece is rendered. ",
