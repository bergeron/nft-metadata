    "description": "From the twisted minds of JimZima and Dark by Design. A real naughty and nice track. \nIt brings together a filthy bassline, a sexy piano melody and a vocal that will stick in your head for days, then just because why the fuck not, twists into a beautifully disgusting electro dubstep vibe, before coming back to its innocence again like the dirty stop out this track is. \nLength: 7.46\nTempo: 140 BPM\n",
