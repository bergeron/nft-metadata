    "description": "Symbolized by the Ram, this Fire Sign is known to be competitive, energetic, fearless, yet impulsive. As the sign is ruled by Mars, a burning desire represented by the color red is often depicted alongside Aries.\n\nReinhardt chose Obianibeli Esu – a goddess in her own right born in the cusp of Aries-Taurus. As she blazes through her kingdom of crimson (created through generative art), the Aries Goddess eliminates all fear as she soars into her freedom.\n\nMuse: Obianibeli Esu\nFashion: House of Puglielli, Usama Ishtay, Nigel Crow – all from The Archives & Showroom\nVFX Make Up: Apple Molita",
