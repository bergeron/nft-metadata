    "description": "Digital hand drawing \n\nThis drawing reflects the quiet and subtleness during winter. \n\nI draw my artistic inspiration both from my travels and my direct environment. For me, drawing and painting are moments of quiet and introspection. This allows me to analyze and interpret the Zeitgeist, focusing on contrasting themes such as urban life vs. nature, environmental protection vs. pollution, or organic vs. synthetic. Other prominent themes of mine include childhood, free play and the experience of nature.",
