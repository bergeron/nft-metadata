    "description": "\nPart of the \"A Handful of Unfilled Wishes\" series\n\n\n“A Handful of Unfulfilled Wishes”\n\nWishes is a series exploring the tensions of identity building between the virtual and the real. Drawing from nerd and fandom culture, Wishes depicts bodies within constructed spaces where feelings collide.\n\nHaving grown up living in an array of online worlds, whether it is online games or other forms of communities, I am drawn to how virtual\nspaces allow new ways to negotiate our identities. The series is focused on the idea of avatars: What do we do in virtual spaces to create and manifest our real selves? How does our presence within virtual spaces influence our physical bodies and how we construct ourselves in real life?\n\nUsing expressionistic gestures in portraiture and still life, Wishes attempts to convey the confusing, uneven emotions that simmer out of the glow of the private screen.",
