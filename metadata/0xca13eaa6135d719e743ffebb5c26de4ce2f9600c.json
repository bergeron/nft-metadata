    "description": "hello hello! i'm lyrah. i'm a writer/producer/singer based in LA.\n\nim sooo excited for this drop. this has been my favorite song these last few months. and i can't wait for you to finally hear it.\n\ni wrote this when I was living with my parents a year into the pandemic. i was making music out of their garage (so literally my own garage band lol). i made this one night when i exhausted listening to all my go-to comfort songs. it started as me in the cold, spidery garage on my uku. \n\nthe chorus was the first thing i wrote:\n\"hold me if i lose my mind \ncatatonic all the time erased\npromise i won't be like this forever\ni can see a day.\"\n\nthis song felt like a breakthrough therapy session. my mental health was in the absolute gutter, but some days you have to accept that and know that it won't be like that forever.\n\na few months ago i revisited this song, rewrote some pieces of it and the song was suddenly there. im now coming up on a year of having started this song. at the time of writing it, it felt more like a song to my boyfriend and wanting that comfort from him. now in listening back, it feels like a song to my future self. ive needed it this past week more than ever and it hits like a completely new song.\n\nmusic is funny like that. hope it does something for you <3",
