    "description": "With an earnest lyrical style and big hooky choruses, our sound lives inside a lush world of textures and riffs and a laid-back Californian sensibility.\n\nABOUT THE RELEASE:\n\nWelcome to the Fever Dream sessions.\n\nThe songs from this session have an energy that came from being pent up and isolated for over a year during lockdown, to being around each other again and playing music in the same room. And it wasn't just any room either, our friend Darrell Thorp invited us to record this 3-track session in the gorgeous rooms at The Village in LA.\n\nAfter an anxious year of pandemics, covid variants, personal health scares, and all the other bad juju the quarantine era brought, this session was a perfect oasis to break the anxiety that had built up since the lockdown began.\n\nThat's why the joyous energy had us buzzing. How cool was it to be around each other again, playing music with the best people, in the best place? Hopefully, some of that good vibe comes through in the music, and that the songs will help release the feverish anxiety into joyous catharsis.\n\nTrack 1 of 3: Haymaker\n\nEdson Choi on the meaning behind the song:\n\n‘I used to be deeply religious, doing ministries and community outreach weekly. One day, the sum of my doubts just hit me. I realized this or any religion wasn't for me.\n \nI had built my life up to that point around this ideology; my friends, my community and plans for the future were centered around this faith. But to stay would be to betray myself and my new epiphany. And so, despite the comfort of belief and loving friends I made through my years in the ministry, I walked away and had to relearn thinking and how I should be living.\n \nThis rude awakening hit me like a punch to the gut, a blinding haymaker to the face. \n \nThe song came many years after that experience, and it instead of it being a bitter takedown of faith and belief, I hope it highlights the beauty in the flaws of our world now. I hope it gives the energy of appreciating the beauty of our world and this life here, not a distant heaven. I tried to capture this thought with the song's closing lines:\n \n\"I'm just staring at too many stars again…don't judge me, cause we're all gonna go sometime.\"’\n\nPersonnel:\n\nco-produced/engineered/mixed by Darrell Thorp\nRecorded at The Village in Los Angeles, CA\nMastered by Ian Sefchick\n\nVocals, Guitars: Edson Choi\nGuitars, Synths, Omnichord: Mike Nissen\nJonathan Bradley: Drums\n\nWritten by Edson Choi and Talk Time\n\nAdditional players:\nBass: John Ransom Tucker\n\nCover Art: Mike Nissen\nGolden Egg Art: Lauren Jennings Piper\n\nLyrics:\n\nDon’t lead me on cause I’m head over heels\nI see the way and I know it ain’t logical, logical\nYou wrap me up and it’s hard to conceal \nIt’s little things add  \nI couldn't save when I saw the impossible\nImpossible\n\nHaymaker lay me down and rise\nI feel the sun and I'm on my knees come night\nHaymaker watch me twist and burn\nI feel the sun and I know I'm an evil one, an evil one\n\nTruth be told, I swear it was real\nThe ground would shake and the sky would turn on and off\nBut when all hell came apart at the seams\nThe simple questions asked\nI couldn’t wait for another surprise to come, police to ghost\n\nHaymaker lay me down and rise\nI feel the sun and I'm on my knees come night\nHaymaker watch me twist and burn\nI feel the sun and I know I'm an evil one, an evil one\n\nHaymaker knock me down \nAround again, around again\nJust stared at too many stars again\nRound again, around again\nDon't judge me out cause somehow \nWhen the clouds come apart now\nYeah we're all gonna die sometime\nYeah we’re all gonna go sometime\n\n\n©2023 Talk Time",
