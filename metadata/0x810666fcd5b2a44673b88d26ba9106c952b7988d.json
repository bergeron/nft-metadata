    "description": "The idea of creating manipulated or fabricated images and videos is not new. From the early days of photography, people have been altering images to change the meaning or context. With the advent of digital technology, the creation of manipulated images and videos has become more accessible and easier to do. Deepfakes, which use artificial intelligence algorithms to create realistic but fake images and videos, are just the latest iteration of this trend. While they may be more sophisticated than previous attempts at fakery, the basic idea behind them is not new. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more advanced forms of fakery emerge in the future.\n\nArtwork created for the MAIF DeepFake event (3/3/2023) curated by ClownVamp and presented by Superchief Gallery.\n\nHigh quality JPG, 7276x4096 pixels.\n\n- Jerome Herr (2023)",
