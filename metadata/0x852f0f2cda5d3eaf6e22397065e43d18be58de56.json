    "name": "San Luis Obispo Homestead Motel, 2015",
    "description": "When I walked into this room, I was compelled by the structure and the details of the room: the cheap furnishing, the blue walls, that pale-yellow telephone; depending on one's personal interpretation, this room could evoke a David Lynch movie, a Hopper painting location, a Jack Kerouac novel and so on, as an extraordinary american standard.",
