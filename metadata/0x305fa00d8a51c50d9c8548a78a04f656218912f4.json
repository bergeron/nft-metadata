    "description": "The prayer\n\n\"It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart.\"  \n- Mahatma Gandhi\n\nBased on the idea of ​​obtaining the authentic and pure movement of the body, under the premise of working with masks. Currently, masks are used as a pedagogical tool for performance artists, aimed to disinhibit and induce body language by allowing the actor, mime, or dancer (in this case) to enter a character, allowing the mask to speak and show its unique personality and nature.\n\nThe prayer is the first of several collections based on exploration with masks, where image and dance fluctuate between dance and dramatic corporeal mime technique, transforming the human being to connect with another reality.\n\nBy hiding the face, we release the voice of the body.\n\nThis monk, \"the prayer\" is based on the use of a larval mask. Voluminous, with shapes that focus attention on a potential personality. The prayer has three mouths: one for worship, one for praying, and the last one to reverence. He prays to enter into a contemplative attitude, connect with the divine, ask for help, or to honor a being or energy that protects him.\n\nDancer: Catalina Castilla  \nMusic: Noel Reyes \n___________  \n2022",
