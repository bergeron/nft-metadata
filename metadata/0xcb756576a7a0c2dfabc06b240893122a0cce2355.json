    "description": "This is a digital artwork from a series titled \"Don't touch!\" by artist Murat Germen, created by uploading photographs to an online web browser interface implemented by Emrah Kavlak. The interface is comprised of the simulation of a 3D environment of cubes and 6 photos can be uploaded to be mapped on the 6 facets of these cubes. The number of cubes and their proportions, angles, distances, rotations are all customizable. Murat Germen uploaded his documentary photos of urban crime scenes that took place in Turkey following a harsh and heritage damaging gentrification / overurbanization process in the last decades and pushed the limits of the interface to create glitches that symbolically refer to the urban crimes.",
