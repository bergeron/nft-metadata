    "name": "Oshun joins Yemaya",
    "description": "Yemaya is the deity of the salty waters. She is the orisha of motherhood. She is the keeper of all riches, waste is her treasure, what is lost can be regained with the help of Yemayá.\n Oshún represents the intensity of feelings and spirituality, human sensuality and what is related to it, delicacy, fineness, love and femininity. She is the protector of pregnant and parturient women.\nThat point where the river becomes the sea, where Oshun meets Yemaya, where a current becomes the infinite sea, this work tries to unite in a single image two of the most worshipped patron saints of Cuba.",
