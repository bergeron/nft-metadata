    "description": "There's something magical about the moon, we reflect upon it, are captivated by it, we dream a little bigger in its presence. The same thing is true about dinosaurs. They capture the imagination in a way other things cannot. Ask a child about dinosaurs and they will be far more informed than you could ever hope to be. As time goes on, more and more practical thoughts replace our Dino knowledge. I didn't come up with the idea for this image, that was my daughter. But as we made it together, I got to experience a bit of the Dino Magic. I hope you do too.",
