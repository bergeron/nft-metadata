    "description": "Part of the METAPRIDE LAND 2022 Collection\n\nHow do you honor your most influential inspirations and  intersectionalities in one outrageous outfit?\n\nQuinley Quokka's closet is a cornucopia of quintessentially queer clothing, and this creation is their first curated costume, carefully concocted from precious pieces peppered throughout the Iconique Collection!\n\nShooting to the moon aboard Sally's ride; straddling the binary in a Tom of Finland harness and tutu from Tinky Winky; ready to kick some ass by filling the cowboy boots of Orville Peck and brandishing Xena's sword; Quinley completes Mako's ultimate look with the classic Bowie bolt, and the artist's own ADHD tattoo, MƒÅori pounamu and the ginger mo' he proudly grew himself.\n\nDropping later in 2022, the Generation Q generative collection will leave choices like these up to a fashionable algorithm - making this outfit truly one-of-a-kind!",
