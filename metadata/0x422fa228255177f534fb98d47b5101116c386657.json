    "description": "This is easily my favourite song I've made this year, and to stay thank you for all of the support over the last 12 months since I started releasing NFT's, I'm giving it away for free.\n\nEscape was finished while I was travelling around Japan (currently still am). Inspiration can come from anywhere, in this case it was travelling around on busy subway trains/shinkansen or walking throuhg ancient shrines/temples - the raw emotion shows through the music.\n\nEnjoy, and thanks again for the support <3",
