    "description": "One day at the high school I went to, a food engineer made a presentation about the drugs given to chickens. The world, the meaning of which I have already questioned, has become more artificial in my eyes. Now every time I eat chicken, I feel like I'm throwing antibiotics in my mouth. This work is in the name of cosmic chickens!\n",
