    "description": "This is my favorite photo taken due to many reasons. Starting with the mission it was one of the riskiest and luckiest yet. I drove from Boston all the way to NYC after work. Covered in poison ivy I threw a blue suit on to fit the part. Climbing around beams to get access to a certain door I broke the button in my pants. I used my tie as a belt and continued up the spire. Having workers below us and stressing out waiting for the right time, we were blessed with an amazing sunset. Then we turned around to see a full rainbow glowing above Manhattan. Until this day I can still feel the pure euphoria and bliss of having this experience. This view is now obstructed by One Vanderbilt and cannot be replicated anymore. To get a rainbow from one of the biggest skyscrapers above Bryant Park, is slim to none. The hours and preparation of this mission was intense alone. To be paid off with this reward and experience with some close comrades is priceless. This is a 1/1 photo in every way possible.",
