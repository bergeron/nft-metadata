    "description": "This photo of Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin is an outtake from a cover story for Swiss publication, Das Magazin. It was made in San Francisco in September of 2015, approximately four months after Ethereum's launch. As the world moves towards decentralized finance with Ethereum at the helm, Vitalik is sure to be cemented as a highly influential historical figure who's far reaching impact cannot be understated. These images are a document of a true visionary during the infancy of his creation that will affect us all in ways we haven't yet begun to comprehend. This is the fourth photo minted from this project and intended to closely coincide with the Ethereum Merge in Sept 2022.",
