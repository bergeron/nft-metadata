    "description": "80% of the sale will be donated to help with the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine! STOP WARS!\nWhy is humanity so fascinated with destruction, wars, suffering and pain? Why we have never found our way to live in peace and harmony together? Why do we try to colonize space instead of trying to fix this world first? Why do we spend millions of dollars to make one vacum bomb, and trillions of dollars to invest in armies and weapons? \nI believe greedy evil people make our world as it is, and want to make us believe it is our fault, and that we are too many for the planet. It is them who produce the plastic we consume, it is them who cause nuclear disaters, oil spills. It is them who decide to bomb and destroy our cities, and who cause the death of millions of innocent souls.\nWe always have a choice in our lives...\nChoose war, and you will NEVER solve any problem, only cause death and destruction!\nChoose life, love, and peace, and the world will suddenly change for the better!\nLOVE one another!",
