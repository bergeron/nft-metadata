    "description": "Every landscape that is captured in a photo is a fleeting moment of subject and light that will never be seen again. Sand dunes always put on a display of quickly changing golden light that dances through the rippling peaks of sand. Nothing Gold Can Stay was captured in perfect conditions of a golden sunset paired with fresh sand dunes in Death Valley National Park. The desert always has a way of teaching me about fleeting moments. After I captured this photo, I sat and watched the light drift in and out of this desolate but beautiful place until dark and then hiked out by the light of my headlamp.",
