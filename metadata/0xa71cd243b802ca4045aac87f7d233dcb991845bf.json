    "description": "A friend from a place between time is a fragmented collection of memories and experiences conglomerated into a living entity. These nonsters are pieces of my past, communicated through my present. They each cry out in a language I do not understand to convey a message or a lesson I was unable to understand at the time of going through the experiences. All of these living breathing memories are held together in the recorded tome of the weezard, ƵധŒƀҾłυട. Weezards, born from tragedy, accidents, and misfortune, grow into massively powerful entities when unchecked. They carry around magic tomes that capture these figments of memories and grow from siphoning out their emotional power.",
