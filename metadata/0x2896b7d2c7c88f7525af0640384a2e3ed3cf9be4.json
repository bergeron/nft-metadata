    "description": "“Red Shot” is the series with which Stella Scala and Simeone Crispino approach to the NFT world. The red color shoots the monochrome representing the world where we live. It permeates the environment by entering your imagination, your visual and sensorial perception. The mission of Vedovamazzei is to change once again their perspective: this first drop will help you approaching their way of doing art, which is always moving and mutating and made of different styles and genres. Such a combination opens anyone’s minds to new points of view. This is only the beginning.",
