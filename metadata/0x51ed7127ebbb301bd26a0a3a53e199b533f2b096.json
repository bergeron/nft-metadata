    "description": "When we were twins\nWe were the same\nWe built a bridge\nI was beside you I was inside you\nWe were the same\n\nWhen I had tools of sight\nYou gave me broken things to see\nWe tangled\n\nNow I’m full when I want to be empty\nMy sight seeing, looking back at me\nMy sight, speaking\nVisions reflecting visions to infinity\n\nShared sight\nScattered and gathered\nTucked in place\nComposed like a nest\nComforting, the touch \n\nIgnore the red (for me, please)\nThat pushes at the edge\nI’m busy finding insane beauty\n\nWe’re not the same\nBut all the same\nYou know me as yourself \nYou can see my heart beat\nIn a still photograph\n\nHold it (please)\nWith delicate touch\nPreserved for when I emerge from black waters\nI will do the same \nFor you",
