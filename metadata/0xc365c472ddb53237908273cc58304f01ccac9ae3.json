    "description": "During the end of the summer, I took a trip to Busan, South Korea. It's a smaller ocean side town, but one of the major cities in Korea. There are a lot of older parts of town where the alleys and side streets still have that old town character and feel. The narrow streets host a number of different restaurants, singing rooms, etc. I found myself standing in front of an empty alley, providing a clear shot through the buildings, where shop owners were waiting for late night customers to stumble in for midnight snack.",
