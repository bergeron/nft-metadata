    "description": "i started “Meet Me Where I Am” at the beginning of this year as a series of verses about feeling like a stranger to myself. a lot of things in my life were suddenly in flux - and all of the things that usually keep me grounded felt like they were slipping through my hands. i was anxious that when the dust settled, nothing would feel the same again - that i’d never find the comfort & calm i’d become used to and that my relationships with family and friends would never be the same. this song is like an open letter to the people in my life - pleading that they will stick around when things settle.\n\nin early september I minted the stems of “Meet Me Where I Am” with on-chain DAW Arpeggi (https://www.arpeggi.io) as one of the first artists to use their “clips” feature. it has been inspiring to see the bones of this song used in so many different ways - and to see all these stems repurposed on-chain. i’m thrilled to bring “Meet Me Where I Am” to Sound to bring this song in its original form to as many people as possible.\n\nwritten & produced by ben kessler",
