    "description": "In January of 2022, Boston was rocked with a blizzard delivering roughly two feet of snow. It left the sidewalks covered & difficult to navigate, and the roads unsafe in many areas. \n\nWhen I returned home, my entire body was coated in snow. I actually had to take a long shower just to remove the ice from my face & hair. To me, these are signs I enjoyed a beautiful evening. \n\nThis image is a part of an ongoing series depicting the intensity of the winter months in the Northeast. \n\nThis is a 1/1 photograph - NFT.
