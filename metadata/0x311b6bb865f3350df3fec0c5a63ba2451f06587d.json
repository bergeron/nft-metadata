    "description": "Inzara is a sister planet of Eberon. Both are known to harbor sentient life. Inzara is covered with dense lush rainforests, with trees that reach into the sky. Here the race of Cliques have made a home. Believed to be not quite of this dimensional plane, there is little known of where they actually come from. Elusive creatures, though can possess magics both healing and destructive.",
