ARMC was founded for the purpose of pursuing possibilities of AR wearable in NFT space and creating a sustainable ecosystem for artists, especially AR creators who have a hard time monetizing their creatives.\n\nWe believe the act of wearing a mask is not only about becoming someone different from yourself or just to hide your face, but a way to discover a new aspect of yourself. There is more in you than you think. Be daring.\n\nWear a mask & Show your world.",
