    "description": "A spin on the popular show 'Ed, Edd, and Eddy' that debuted in 1999. My English wasn't too great at the time - not good enough to pick up every joke and gag, but this show had me rolling with laughter none the less.\n\nThe text reads \"Ed, Eddo, Eddy no Monogatari\" roughly translating to \"The Tale of Ed, Edd and Eddy\".",
