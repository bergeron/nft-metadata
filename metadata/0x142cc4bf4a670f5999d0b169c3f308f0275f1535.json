    "description": "Known as the First Lady of Graffiti, Lady Pink is considered one of the most recognizable graffiti artists in the world. She is a cult figure, being a rare female artist who carved out a space for herself in the boy’s club of graffiti art, having started to paint on trains in the 1970’s and produced work for gallery shows by 1980. This is her genesis NFT based on the mural that she created for the Museum of Graffiti in 2020.  The mural was originally created in celebration of young activists fighting for women's equality, LGBT rights, proper immigration policy, and victims' advocacy. Each of these issues are represented in Pink's mural. This NFT is an effort to preserve murals, like this one, that are no longer in existence but now will live on the blockchain.",
