    "description": "After Salisby had been viciously attacked and blown apart by the dark lords.  Salisby awakened standing inside a large room and standing on a platform.  Salisby observed about 1500 tiny lighted stars orbiting his healing light of happiness.  After standing in the same spot for about a decade.  Salisby could see that his light had become more dense and the orbiting tiny stars only numbered near one hundred.  Salisby soon departed the healing room in search of new lighted friends.",
