    "description": "This artwork was exhibited at the HOMAGE Digital Art Event at the Constantin Brâncuși Center of the Craiova Art Museum, curated by Claire Silver, in June 2023.\n\nThe work depicts a monumental structure inspired by Constantin Brâncuși's “Endless Column.\"\n\nThe rhythmic repetition of waves in the structure serves as a symbol of the cyclical nature of life and the profound human experiences of war and peace. The yellow chair placed next to the column signifies the ceaseless waiting of humanity for the eventual termination of this cycle. Accordingly, the base colors yellow, blue, and red have been selected to represent the most fundamental and associated emotions of hope, despair, and sacrifice.",
