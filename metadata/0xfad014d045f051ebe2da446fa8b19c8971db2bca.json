    "description": "Self-reflection \n\nI held up the glass in front of me and caught an old reflection of the younger fiercer me.  Hello to my unrestrained used to be.  Stop trying to run away and give lots of smiles away.  Ones that are purposeful and bright as if they were your last chance to make an impact.  Set things right.  \n\nI lived alongside a lake in British Columbia, Canada for 2 years.  I spent those years alone on a journey of self-reflection to face my inner dragons and start the transformation of who I wanted to become. \n\nThe best decision of my life. Those with an open and teachable heart learn invaluable lessons along life's way.  \n\n1/1 NFT \n\nSarah Lyndsay - Photographer ",
