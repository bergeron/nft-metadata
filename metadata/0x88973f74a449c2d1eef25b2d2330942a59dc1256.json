    "description": "I used to hate my shadow self, the parts of me that I kept hidden and wanted to change. \nBut through my journey, I've learned that my shadow is not something to be suppressed. Instead, I've discovered the immense potential and strength it holds.  \nNow, I embrace it and use it to co-create. By unifying both polarities, a sense of grace is born.  \nAccepting both my flaws and virtues creates a diamond with thousands of nuances, giving me a broader perception of the world.\n\nThis mural was created through a partnership with @adistrictmx \n\nCheck out the memories of the mural here:\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2j2jsgek",
