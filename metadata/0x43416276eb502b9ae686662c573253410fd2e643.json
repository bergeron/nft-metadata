    "name": "FIRE TIGER",
    "description": "The “Fire Tiger” was created as an ode to our inner strength.\n\nThe Fire Tiger represents our own ever-reincarnating and strengthening self. The tiger bravely walks through the fire. Yet despite the burns, courageously rises above the flames. While the fire may lacerate its physical vessel, the tiger perseveres. It’s burns mend and fortify its body for any fires that may lie ahead. \n\nAnd every time we walk through fire, we are more confident of our own inner strength. We can trust ourselves to make it through. The future fires around us don’t seem to burn so much because the fire in our soul will always burn brighter. We cannot be tamed. \n\nThis is a reminder that we survived a 100% of our worst days. ",
