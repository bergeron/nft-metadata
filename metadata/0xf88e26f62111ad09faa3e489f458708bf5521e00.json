    "description": "We don't know how long it took since the world disappeared. Or, if it is still in place, we are too far out of reach. But math is infallible. We are pretty sure the world is destroyed. \n\nAutopilot brought us to a planet he thought might be life. And it started the process of awakening from deep sleep. Sleeping for 275 years is exhausting.\n\nWe don't know what's out there right now. Gravity is interesting. We can't see anything but water. We're not going out until we're sure.\n\nAnother Verse LOG 1\n",
