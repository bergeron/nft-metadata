    "description": "I consider this photograph the first one that fully satisfied what I have been looking for since I started capturing moments. It was taken in Seville on a warm and sunny day in the Andalusian winter.\n\nThe end result is a combination of vision, commitment and, of course, luck. The thrill of aligning these three aspects, when only two of them can be controlled, is what drives me to go out and seek fine art in the street.",
