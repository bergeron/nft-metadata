    "description": "Growing up in Western Australia I’ve always wanted to visit the Bungle Bungle Range located in the Kimberley.\n\nThe ground is scattered with smooth pebbles and limestone beach scenes that come complete with stark white beach sand and the pathways are scattered with elegant Livistona Palms.\n\nThe beehive shaped domes are striped with cyanobacteria with the main structure composed of sandstone, deposited millions of years ago!\n\nI was lucky enough to get on the Dream Photography Astro Workshop where we spent 8 days shooting at some epic locations in the East Kimberley, the furtherest region in the North/East of my home-state, Western Australia.\n\nThe magical, World Heritage-listed Bungle Bungle Range covers over 400kms of land situated in the Purnululu National Park where the Gija and Jaru people are the Traditional Custodians. \n\nThis is my first astro to be minted, I have a mixture of nerves and pure excitement as I have worked towards increasing my Astro skills since my first shot in 2019!\n\nThere will be more…\n\n20% of the sale of this image will be put back in to an arts program in Kununurra.\n\nContract: ERC-721  \nEdition: 1 of 1  \nDate: August 2022  \nCamera: Nikon Z6  \nSize: 7560 x 5030 px  \nSold Elsewhere: No  \nSingle Image: Yes  \nArtist: Vicki-Louise White @ VLWphotography\n\nLicensing: The NFT Holder is free to use this image for displaying privately in non-commercial settings.\n\nWhere displayed on social media, in virtual galleries and virtual rooms the creator, VLW Photography should be credited.\n\nRights are not provided to produce commercial merchandise, commercial distribution, or derivative works.  \nPlease contact the creator to discuss.\n\nThe Copyright remains with the creator, Vicki-Louise White at VLW Photography.",
