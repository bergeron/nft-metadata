    "description": "The Playboy Rabbitars are a lagomorphic-themed civilization of 11,953 unique, non-fungible rabbits inspired by Playboy iconography, heritage and lore. In the context of the metaverse, the Rabbitars are NFTs that live on the Ethereum Blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. Each Rabbitar is generated from 175+ traits, including fur, ears, facial expressions, apparel, accessories, occupation-related characteristics and more. At its simplest, you can think of each Rabbitar as a key that unlocks membership to all the possibilities of Playboy on the blockchain: exclusive access to Playboy art and artist collaborations, IRL and metaverse experiences, and physical and virtual fashion. (And yes, you can tell your friends you officially belong to a Playboy Club!). Visit https://playboyrabbitars.com for all the NFT-ea.",
