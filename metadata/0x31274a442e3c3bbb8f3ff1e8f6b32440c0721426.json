    "description": "I am Ukrainian, living in Kyiv. Russia came to my country with war. I donate to the Ukrainian army, but itâ€™s not enough. So I want to sell my old piece and donate all costs from it to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\n\nI created this picture in 2013. Back to then, there was peace in my country.\n\nIn 2014 Russia occupied Ukrainian Crimea. Later it started the war in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Now, in 2022, Russia started a full-scaled attack at the whole territory of Ukraine.\n\nSupport Ukraine, we need it.",
