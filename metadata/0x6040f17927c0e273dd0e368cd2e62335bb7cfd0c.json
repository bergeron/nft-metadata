    "description": "I remember seeing this bright light poking through the curtain.  \n\nI quickly peaked out the window and saw the sky beginning to burn. Honestly I've never got out of bed so quick and grabbed my camera.\n\nStanding on the decking in thermals only (as you don't think about clothes when you see a sky like this ðŸ¤£) \n\nIt has to be one of the best sunrises I've seen in a long time",
