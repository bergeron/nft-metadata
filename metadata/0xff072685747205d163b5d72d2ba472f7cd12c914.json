    "description": "2023\n3000 x 4000\n27mb\n[DEVOID](https://www.hyperrealfilms.com/devoidart)\n\n'This generation's painters grew up with video games, TV, and the internet. For me, it was Atari 2600, dial-up, and VHS tapes that had been recorded over multiple times until the original material had been lost to the noise. What was left were echoes, errors, and pixel dust. WALTZ IN THE FIFTH DIMENSION is from FLOURISH, a collection of abstracts that explore my fascination with multiple 'stacked' realities and higher dimensional perception. Each piece starts as an artwork that is slowly undone and used as its own brush - cannibalising its form on the way to something else.'\n\nBIO: Justin Tagg (DEVOID) is a multi-disciplinary storyteller based in the UK. His film, literary and art work has been exhibited around the world, whilst his deep interest in maths, science and philosophy give his work a constant sense of metaphysical speculation. ",
