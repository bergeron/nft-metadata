    "description": "Sunrise at the Sandy Point Shoal Lighthouse in the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. I woke super early the morning to fly the drone not knowing what the sunrise or weather was going to be like. Right after I got to the location the sky just started to light up this bright red color. I immediately put my drone up in the air and I was able to capture this shot. Sometimes it's just a matter of being in the right place at the right time to capture a shot like this. \n\n\nTitle: Morning Light  \nEditions: 50  \nArtist: Kevin Olson",
