    "description": "From bliss to misery, anxiety to indifference.\n \nMoods is a mini series done to reflect states of mind as they happen. Similar to keeping a journal, each of the pieces in this series is meant to reflect my state of mind on a given moment as I'm working on them.\nThis has been a fairly long endeavor, between procrastination, the difficulties of self-reflection, and the very frustrating variation in mood each day, I ended up jumping from piece to piece, dictated by what felt right that given day.",
