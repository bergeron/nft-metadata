    "description": "Sacrificing comfort and stability, my life of full time travel has been an ongoing quest towards freedom and discovery. My name is Caleb and Iâ€™m an American nomad. I find happiness in wild places and seek intimate conversations under remote skies. Stepping away from the         ordinary and pursuing the bizarre, my expectations were surpassed in nearly every way. From some of the tallest mountain tops to the deepest oceans, I've dedicated to documenting places and cultures of the world unexplored by most. I believe that embracing the journey is more valuable than the end destination. I'm a photographer of fleeting moments - a storyteller, a brother, a lover, and a friend.                                            I'm grateful for this opportunity to meet you and grow together. \nHappy travels!",
