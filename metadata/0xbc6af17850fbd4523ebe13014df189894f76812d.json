    "description": "There’s a story about a horse who can never stop running, for if he does, his legs will give out and he’ll never run again. So he runs. He runs until his veins pump battery acid. And then he runs some more. Past the people he loves and those that love him. He runs towards an invisible end. And yet, regardless of the unknown that lies ahead, he’s certain his feet are on the right track.",
