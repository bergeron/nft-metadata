    "description": "Inner Tools is a collection of 777 animated GIFs that brings back the ancient art form of mandalas through a contemporary lens. Inspired by the structure of mandalas, these GIFs utilize vibrant colors, glitch effects, and 3D renderings to create a unique visual experience. As a tool for meditation, where you can experience a state of flow and peak experiences, Inner Tools is the bridge between the past, present, and future, as the timeless practice of mandalas is reimagined for the digital age."
