    "description": "Inspired by Ophelia's story, I wanted to create this photo. But my Ophelia is still alive, she looks into your eyes. \"Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes, as one incapable of her own distress.\" She is carried by the waves of a dark stormy river, there is a question in her gaze...\n\n07/22/2021 6:34, morning near river Dnipro in Kamianske, Ukraine. It was a sleepless night for our shoot. We talked all night and drank tea with delicious cookies. And early in the morning we moved to a location on the other side of the city. I checked the bottom of the river and Yulia was able to enter the water so that we could start filming. The water was really rough and it was difficult for her to stay in one point, but we managed it. We had fun that night and morning by the river, I still remember the sound of the river and our laughter. Happy day for the dreamer.\n\n2766Ñ…3457",
