    "description": "Title: PROTECT BLACK TRANS LIVES (2020)  \nDate Photographed: June 10th, 2020  \nLocation: Downtown Los Angeles, California, USA \nPhotographer: Raven Trammell\n\nWe had been marching for a few miles at this point. We stopped to gather for a moment, as the organizers of the march motivated us through their bull horns. \n\n\"WE NEED EACH OTHER MORE THAN EVER!\" \n\nThis was moments before LAPD shut down all public transportation. Leaving hundreds of protestors stranded. Rather than panic, we continued our march in the streets of Downtown Los Angeles.",
