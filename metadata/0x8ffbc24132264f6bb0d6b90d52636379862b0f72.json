    "description": "Love, is the foundation of the kings of heaven to creation. It can soar in one second and then crash upon its own destruction.\nHeavenly Kings hold ultimate power. One second, they can destroy the world, but in another second, they can rebuild it. They are masters of the elements and the very balance between good and evil.\nFor centuries, monarchs were considered the embodiment of divinity on earth, destined to rule by God's will. Never underestimate the power of love.",
