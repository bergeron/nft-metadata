    "description": "\"My November was my solo trip to Utah. I ended up hiking 6 miles in the snow in Bryce Canyon; it was gorgeous. And it was the first time in my life that I did something like that on my own. It made me realize that I was strong and that I could really do anything I want.\"\n\n\"My November is a windy city in the Bay, fall leaves and shortened days, knitted caps and hoodies grey, with good food and coffee made (fresh).\"\n\n\"My November was when my daughter was born 7 years ago. She was (and still is) my everything.\"\n\n\"I think my November is coming up soon. In the last year I realized what’s my true potential and we have big life changing plans (professionally and personally) for 2023. So I kind of feel like it’s still somewhere in the future tbh\"",
