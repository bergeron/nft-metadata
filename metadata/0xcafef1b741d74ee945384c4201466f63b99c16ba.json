    "description": "Acrylic and resin on canvas 120x120\n\nDigitizing the flow that walks in the depths where the soul slips.\nThe reflection is murky as if dissolving something and the current flows without memory that is long gone.\nDon’t let this moment be desecrated by being dragged away.\nBenevolent fate. Did you hear me! Theme, plot and cast.\nI’m going to get up from my chair and do something.\nDoing the opposite, I dare to say that times, displacements and universes do not wait for my passive presence.\nWe are elsewhere going too far by standing still.\nI warn you that waiting is a dangerous place.\nThe debauched mind remains in the bodies and in the proposed crossings.\nHow can we expect the connections that the irrational accompaniment of a cycle that ferments with us can provide?\n\nThe first owner will receive the framed work shipped from Brazil in a wooden crate and will be on the whitelist for the new NFT's in this collection that will be released during 2022.\n\nhttps://www.nini.art.br",
