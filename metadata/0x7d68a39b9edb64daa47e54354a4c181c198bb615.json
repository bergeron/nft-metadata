    "description": "Land of Blossoms is collections of NFTs inspired by The Peach Blossom Spring, a fable written by Tao Yuanming in 421 about a chance discovery of an ethereal utopia where the people led an ideal existence in harmony with nature, unaware of the outside world for centuries. The peach blossom spring has become a symbol of an ideal world. The story inspired many later poems, paintings and music compositions. The Flowers & Birds is the first collection of Land of Blossoms. This collection consists of generative digital art based on freehand style watercolor & ink paintings of flowers and birds. For more information, please visit our website: www.landofblossoms.xyz.",
