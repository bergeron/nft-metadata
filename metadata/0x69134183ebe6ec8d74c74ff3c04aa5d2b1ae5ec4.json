    "description": "Our lives are one big puzzle,\nWe don’t know how many pieces we’ve got, There are people that fit in quite nicely, And people who try but do not, We’re constantly adding more pieces,\nAll the memories of things we’ve been through, We add laughter and tears and adventure, And the lessons we’ve learnt to be true, Everyone has their own puzzle,\nThere will be ones where you do not fit, Don’t you ever dare make your piece smaller,\nJust so you can live there for a bit, If you keep cutting off all your edges,\nOne day you won’t recognise what you see, And you’ll forget the person you once were, Before the world told you who you should be, Make the most of each piece in your puzzle, It’ll be a grand masterpiece when it’s done,\nSo you won’t have to look back when it’s over, And realise you’ve left out the sun.",
