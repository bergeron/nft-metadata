    "description": "Genesis drop from 20-year-old producer Ancientz out of Oklahoma, USA.\n\nFrom the artist: Music is a universal language that I'm learning to speak. No matter the genre, there is always a complex process that creates a beautiful result in the end. My only dream is to share with the world what I create. If I'm not making music, I'll either be working or playing a game to help the music making process not be repetitive or daunting.\n\n "
