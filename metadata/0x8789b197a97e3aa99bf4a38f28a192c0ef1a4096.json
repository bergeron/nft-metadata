    "description": "The Idea Metaphor NFT series correspond with the Thought Metaphor NFT series which are constituent parts of the Psychedelic Disko Flux collection minted on the Ethereum blockchain on various platforms. As a digital non-fungible token, the meaning fits exactly with the theme of a contemporary practice that fixes a thought in code, in an eternally mutable collective consciousness. \n\nThese works are developed from and towards visual research into late 1960s culture for my Fine Art practice-based PhD at the University of Leeds using hand-marbled paper, physical collage, digital collage and animation. These pieces are integral to the development of physical works and installations.\n",
