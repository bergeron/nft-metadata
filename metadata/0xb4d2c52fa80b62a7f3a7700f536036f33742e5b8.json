    "description": "RHYTHM OF COLORS\n\nThis photo won a gold medal with \"Aydin efes\" in the homeland themed photography competition held in Hipa in 2019.\n\nZeybek is a local folk dance.Zeybek represents a brave man who protects the people.\nIt can be played by one person or several people.\n\nGame figures vary according to the player's emotions and skills. For this reason, in single zeybeks, there are differences in the gait, collapse and turns of those who play the same game. Tabs, knee kicks, walks in the game symbolize zeybek's self-confidence, honesty, bravery and challenge to the environment.\n\n\nEfe and Zeybek outfits are truly magnificent and embroidered with extraordinary delicacy.\n\n\nArtis: Seckin Yenici\n Edition: 1/1\nDate: 2015\nFile: jpeg 300 dpi\nLocation: Kusadasi - Aydin / Türkiye\nImage Size: 5400x 3600",
