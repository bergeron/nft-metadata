You can choose to rock something that was made in bulk or, you can choose art that was made handcrafted and tailored made to your liking by an artist who's been making art his entire life.\n\nGUCCI PANDAS is a limited edition, hand crafted, custom sculpted and, custom painted  NFT's originally made as \"Frenly Pandas\" derivatives but breaking off into an independent series of primarily panda shaped one of a kind sculptures.\n\n(Full IP rights are granted only to the current owner of each NFT)",
