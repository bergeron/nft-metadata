    "description": "I took this photo in 2021 at Tuz Gölü, the second largest lake in Turkey.\n\nThis is a lake that people can walk on because it is a shallow lake. I had taken pictures here before, but this was the difference. Instead of water, there was mud on the surface that should normally be covered with water. After a few days of heavy rain, the lake was covered with mud.\n\nOf course, this had a different visual effect. I tried to take a view from the top with the drone next to me. The result was much better than I expected. It was as if the people walking on the lake were on a different planet.\n\nBecause I trust the power of my photo, I submitted it to the Sony World Photo Contest 2022. The result I expected came and my photo was shortlisted in the landscape category.\n\nCamera: DJI Mavic Mini\nDimensions: 3000 × 1158\nResolution: 300dpi\nLocation: Ankara, Turkey\nDate: 19/07/2021\nEdition: 1/1",
