    "description": "Mona Lisa, the first Marilyn Monroe. The symbol of seduction, mystery, and allure. The image has become such a household name over the centuries, that I feel that the woman, who once sat and posed for Leonardo DaVinci, must be rolling and screaming in her grave. \"That is NOT what I was smiling about. I didn't even want to become Immortal. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT RESPONSIBILITY LEO?!?! DO YOU?!\" \n\nSo here,  I go...trying to free the imagery, from the commonality that is associated with, \"knowing the Mona Lisa,\" that has penetrated and held fast within the minds of millions for centuries. \n\nMarcel DuChamp, one of the members of the Dada movement, symbolized the \"anit-art.\" Taking images and objects from the world around us and placing them within a context that allowed for an entirely new perspective to be seen, or uncovered.  \n\nCheers to you DuChamp or the Inspiration and A glass or two for you my Moaning IMortal Mona.
