    "description": "Clade is a fictional character entering into fact. She seeks for visual works and directs the absent audience (i.e. the audience who do not directly come to watch them) towards the texture of works, by concentrating upon their influential elements (e.g. form, color, and the established intertextual relations). Clade chooses secondary state for the given works in order to describe their hidden details attracting her attention.",
