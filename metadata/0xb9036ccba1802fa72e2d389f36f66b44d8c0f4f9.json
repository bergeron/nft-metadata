    "description": "After 71 years of dedicating my life to the stars, I am thrilled to mint my genesis NFT, \"Newton 1 - The Witch Head Nebula.\"\n\nLocated approximately 900 light-years from Earth in the constellation Eridanus, IC 2118 (also known as the Witch Head Nebula) is an ancient supernova remnant classified as a \"reflection nebula.\"  The Witch Headâ€™s interstellar dust grains are illuminated by the light reflected from the nearby blue supergiant star Rigel, the brightest star in constellation Orion and the seventh brightest star in the sky.  The cloud's outline looks like the profile of a laughing witch, which is how IC2118 got its nickname.\n\nThe photo was shot from my home observatory in Osoyoos, British Columbia.\n\nClear skies,  \nJack Newton",
