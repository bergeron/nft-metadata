    "description": "A piece that captures the real estate business and behavior of some house owners across Nigeria. \nThe lifestyle and memories of living in a “Face me, I slap you” or a room and parlor with general kitchen, toilets and bathrooms, leaking roofs ,  the terrible  holes in your bathroom and kitchens because of big rats, the love and fights shared amongst the kids in the compound, the terrible house conditions because the landlord has refused to pay attention to house maintenance but always expects you to pay your rent on or before due date😂, environmental roasters and one black sheep in the compound that won’t adhere, the drama and fights, the cracks on your walls, the writings, posters and bills😂😂\nNot to forget awarding the rank of Cheif Tenants C.T to the person who has the longest stay record in the compound.😂😂",
