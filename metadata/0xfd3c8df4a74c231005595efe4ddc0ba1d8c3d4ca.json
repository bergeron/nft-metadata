    "description": "“The Big Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”\n\nIsn’t that how the saying goes? As a New Yorker now indelibly linked with Apple imagery, I’ll call it close enough.\n\nMy grandfather, Albert Grobe, was a classical News Man - the Chief Announcer and Head of the broadcast arm of the New York Times, WQXR. When he retired, he began a second life as a photojournalist on the side, appearing in, among others, LIFE Magazine.\n\nLIFE was the photojournalistic sibling of TIME.\n\nNearly 5 decades later, three of my own photographs* were displayed in an art gallery for the first time - sponsored by TIME Magazine and located in New York City. The Big Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.\n\nI hadn’t seen my hometown in three years - since The Beforetimes - and I couldn’t stay long. The whole trip was a mere 48 hours, but time is a fickle thing, and TIME is what brought me home in the first place.\n\nThis shot was taken the evening after the gallery opening, just as the sun was setting on Park Avenue.\n\n\n*Works featured in the TIME Gallery:  \nPatience & Grace  \nMonumental Task #6  \nPhotographer’s DNA #49",
