    "description": "🌎 During my last trip to Julfa city, I had the opportunity to shoot this collection.\nJulfa is located between Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran along the Aras River. \nAs a result of the political and economic situation in the region, it is not permitted to take photos. However, it took a lot of coordination to photograph the fantastic architecture of this area.\n\n🏅Despite having been taken less than a month ago, this collection won second place in a prestigious national photo festival.\n\n📸Date Taken: May 2022\n\n🏙Dimensions: 3945 × 2630",
