    "description": "ugly faces in dark places is a collection of 49 faces with unfiltered thoughts that glow in the dark, created in a darker personal period of my life.\n\nan artistic exercise that followed two rules: each face shape had to be defined by a single circular stroke drawn with a mouse; each thought had to be the first thing that came to mind after looking at that face.\n\n\nfew were originally minted on tezos, in 2021, but barely seen the daylight before hic et nunc closed, leaving them trapped in nft limbo until now.\n\nreleasing these into the world is finding closure from those dark times. because some things are only seen when the lights go out.",
