    "description": "My last name in Dutch means rose and my favorite color to use in my artworks is red, so I couldn't resist creating an artwork featuring a red rose.  \nThis is an autobiographical artwork in the sense that it represents my first months in the NFT world. In this beautiful rose you will find a bunch of hidden NFT's I have created.\n\nThis NFT comes with a non-exclusive commercial use license that can be found here:  \nhttps://foundation.app/@ArjenRoos/nftcl/1",
