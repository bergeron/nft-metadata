It snowed heavily, and the girl was a bit anxious because of the cold weather, yet, she was also amazed by the snowy scenery. \nMeanwhile, Snowflakes fell on the girl's long eyelashes.\nThis illustration was done when I went out on a snowy winter day, inspired by its color and scenery. \n(a large size of the illustration in jpeg or png format will be given to the collectors)\n\n2522X3421",
