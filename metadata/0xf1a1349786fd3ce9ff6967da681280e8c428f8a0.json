    "description": "As I walk with the mountain I am greeted with the warm embrace of silence.\n\nThe silence that speaks volumes through the faintest of whispers of the heart. \n\nThe silence that heals.\nThe silence that nurtures.\nThe silences that clarifies, purifies, and amplifies.\n\nAs  I find myself speeding up my pace, \n\nthe mountain in her wisdom reminds me to tune in. \n\nTo slow down.\n\nStep.\nBy. \nStep.\n\nOne foot in front of the other. \n\nIn her wisdom and silence, she whispers into my soul:\n\n“Nature never rushes and she is always on time.”\n\nAnd in that moment, I remembered that I am nature.",
