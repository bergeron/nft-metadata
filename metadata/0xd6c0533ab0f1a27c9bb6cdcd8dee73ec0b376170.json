    "name": "BeatRita Cenci",
    "description": "BeatRita Cenci\n\nBeatrice Cenci was a young Roman girl who met an early and unjust death on the infamous bridge of Castel Sant'Angelo on September 11, 1599, at the hands of the judges of Pope Clement VIII Aldobrandini, for allegedly conspiring against her violent and rapist father, who was eventually killed by her relatives.\nAccording to popular belief, her ghost appears on the bridge every anniversary of her execution and is the most famous ghost in Rome.\nHer tragic story has inspired many artists, including P. B. Shelley, Stendhal, A. Dumas p√®re, N. Hawthorne, A. Artaud, and A. Moravia.\nIn the visual arts, the portrait to which I have paid homage (with Rita as a young Beatrice in a defiant pose, seeking revenge on her persecutors), once attributed to Guido Reni or his pupil Elisabetta Sirani, but now believed by art critics to be by Ginevra Cantofoli (1618-1672), is particularly noteworthy.",
