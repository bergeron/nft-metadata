    "description": "The Crystals of Ether function as an access token for the pre-sale of the Adventurers mint.\n\nIt is said, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. The Ether Crystals are that critical element within the Kingdoms of Ether that are used as a form of currency, and also by those who believe such magic, a catalyst for revolution, exists in these precious elements.\n\nNot a technology, an element, but as with all elements, ones that start as a simple precious mineral often evolve, their use becoming more complex as great minds get to work. Their powers are just being discovered, they are used in technology, they inspire, and they help create change.",
