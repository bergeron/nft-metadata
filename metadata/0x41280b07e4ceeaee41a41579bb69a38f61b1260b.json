    "description": "Urban Disconnect | NYC HiberNation  \n \nFor centuries the great cities of the world have expanded. Now having reached critical mass and cities no longer serve the needs of people.  \n \nIn an historic moment for mankind an octagonal section of Manhattan detaches and rises above the rest of the city, revealing a gargantuan android head from below the surface. Accelerating off into space the android takes with it, it’s captive population, and leaves behind a giant crater and an astonished world.  \n \n---\n\nThe Urban Disconnect series showcases moments on the android’s perilous intergalactic journey.  \n \nIn this first release, NYC HiberNation, the people of NYC are put into a state of 'cryo-sleep' through the simulated winter months.",
