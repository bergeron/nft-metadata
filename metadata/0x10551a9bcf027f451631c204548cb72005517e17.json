    "description": "It's my belief that the strongest portraits are those that strip an image down to bare bones. As such, minimalism, simplicity and geometric shapes have always been major themes across my work. This piece is not only not an exception to that practice but rather what I consider to be a quintessential example of those principles used to their fullest extent. It is, in short, one of my most beautiful and revealing images. \n\nEDITION: 1/20\n\n\nLICENSE: EXTENDED EDITORIAL\n\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
