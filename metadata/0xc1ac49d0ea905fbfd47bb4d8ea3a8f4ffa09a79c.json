    "description": "One collector purchases an abstract painting called \"Ghost Voices\" and hangs it in his mansion. Strange whispers start to haunt him, but instead of feeling scared, he feels empowered. He realizes that the ghosts trapped within the painting give him strength and power. The whispers guide him towards success in his business and personal life.\n\nThe collector becomes obsessed with the painting and spends hours staring at it, learning to listen to the whispers and interpret their messages. He soon becomes one of the most successful and powerful businessmen in the world, thanks to the guidance of the ghost voices.\n\nDespite others' warnings about the painting's eerie presence, the collector refuses to take it down. He believes that the ghosts trapped inside give him strength and courage in his darkest moments. And when the collector finally passes away, his ghostly whispers continue to echo throughout the mansion, passing on his knowledge and power to those who dare to listen.",
