    "description": "In the middle ages, red-haired women, red flowers and scarlet animals were burned to death. Red women were chosen especially, and they were seen as witches or vampires, The Spanish Inquisition was deciding on the tortures. This shows us how much violence against women is practiced.\n\nIn order to show the effects of this dark period in my collection, the veiling of black is blended with red, which represents fire and sins. The collection, which pictured the strong and independent women, is planning to push the target audience to question",
