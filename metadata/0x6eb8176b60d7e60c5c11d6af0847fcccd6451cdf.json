    "description": "Hilma af Klint (1862–1944) was born in Stockholm where she studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. She established herself as an artist, exhibiting figurative paintings. As a devout Christian she later became involved in spiritualism, and interested in the ideas of Rosicrucian theosophy and anthroposophy. In 2018 a large survey at the Guggenheim Museum in New York became the best-attended exhibition in the history of the institution.\n\nAn official seven volume catalogue raisonné, published by Stolpe Publishing with the endorsement of the Hilma af Klint Foundation, was finalized in 2022. The second volume, Paintings for the Temple, were created between 1906 and 1915 and are af Klint’s most important body of work. The digital extension of the catalogue includes all the 193 key artworks offered in the NFT series Hilma af Klint - Paintings for the Temple, presented by Stolpe Publishing, Acute Art and available on the GODA platform.",
