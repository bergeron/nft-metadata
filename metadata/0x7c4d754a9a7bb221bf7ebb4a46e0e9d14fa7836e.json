    "description": "Mountains surrounding the city of Quito. Ecuador 2012.\n\n\"Buscando a Bolívar\" is the result of my journeys through Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela between 2009 and 2014, during the presidencies of Evo Morales, Rafael Correa and Hugo Chavez. \n\nAlong this route I found much more than I was looking for. I was dazzled by the unexpected, actracted by the ambiguity and the complexity; which are the very essence of reality.",
