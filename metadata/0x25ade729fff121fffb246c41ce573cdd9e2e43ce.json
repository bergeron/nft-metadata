    "description": "\"THE GREAT CHAPBOOK 4\" is a selection created from freely available preset 3D models and images captured while playing online games, which are first converted into 3D scan data models and then rearranged into a screen layout using 3D design software, while adding various elements such as water, fire, or smoke effects and physical environments. \n\nThe resulting videos and images are then uploaded online, released into the open virtual environments, in the form of a meme which runs for about 3 to 10 seconds - mimicking the survival strategy of today's video and imagery contents. The selection of works invites the audience to an imaginary world of nonlinear plots created by fragmentarily connected numerous images that the artist has been obliged to collect.\n",
