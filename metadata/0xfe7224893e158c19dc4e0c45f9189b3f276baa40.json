THE ONLY WAY OUT IS IN\n\nQ u i e t ,\nTrapped in silence.\nShe sense the pull out the Self, so subtle.\nShe feels love, she finds love, she is love.\n\nShe is breaking in - turning the trapped into the flow.\nShe merges with the Self and become one with the Divine.\nFor the sake of love, love of the Divine Self.",
