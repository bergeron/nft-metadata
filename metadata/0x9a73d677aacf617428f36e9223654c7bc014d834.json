    "description": " Jimmy Edgar is a multidisciplinary conceptual artist whose works encompass sound, sculpture, digital images, and blockchain technology. Deeply inspired by the meta\nphysical phases of matter, he explores the materiality of physical and digital domains through his works.\n\n\n“Visual expression always felt to me as my foundation. Music came so naturally to me that it seemed to be a means for me to be involved with visual media. I’m driven to creatively and technologically innovate within the harmony of both.” - Jimmy Edgar \n\n\n‘Monument’ is a testament to the Obelisk in culture. The work reimagines what these objects might look like in the future — and speaks to the current state of digital objects today.\n\n\nJimmy has graciously donated the work to raise funds for Refraction. All proceeds go to our summer programming as we continue to experiment with ways to redistribute economies across artist communities, and champion diverse curation around the world. ",
