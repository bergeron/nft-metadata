    "description": "In Seattle, whenever it snows, the city shuts down. There aren't many snowplows available in the city because it doesn't snow often enough to justify having them. One of the things I love the most about snow days in Seattle is how quiet everything gets. I love going for walks around the neighborhood with my camera to see how much things have changed under a blanket of snow",
