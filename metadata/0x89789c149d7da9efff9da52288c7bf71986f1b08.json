    "description": "Often times when I'm taking photos on the ferries, I'm joined by my partner and our dog, Bixby. They're not typically shown in photos that I mint, but I have a personal collection of photos of them on the ferries that I will love & forever cherish.\n\nI'm extremely grateful that I get to share these beautiful life experiences, doing what I love with the ones I love the most.  I always enjoy stumbling upon a candid moment between passengers, also sharing a beautiful life experience together, aboard the ferries.  ",
