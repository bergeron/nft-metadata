    "description": "A piece that represents my then to now.\n\n“The Crossing” is my first open edition and pays tribute to my sold out genesis collection of the same name. While at the same time maintaining the aerial perspective synonymous with that of my most recent collection, “Moments From Above”. \n\nThis image was shot from above the iconic Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo, Japan. While it was captured at the same time as “The Crossing” collection, it represents the development in my editing style since its launch in August of 2021. ",
