    "description": "At first I drew three large circles, which looked like the heads of flies. When I drew the mouth, I wanted to draw a skull, which reminded me of Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies.\nBeelzebub is known as a demon of great renown, but his countenance is strangely friendly.\n\n最初は大きな3つの円を描き、それがハエの頭に見えた。口を描くと髑髏を描きたくなり、それが蝿の王ベルゼブブを想起させた。\nベルゼバブといえば大悪魔として知られているが、その表情は不思議と親しみやすい。\n\n****\nCOLLECTION STATEMENT\n\nThis is an experiment that begins with unconscious-driven work and moves to consciousness-driven work.\n\nThe works listed in this collection are created by painting colors unplanned and on impulse, and then materializing the views seen in the process.\n\nThe purest human emotion is at the DEPTH, and we can only observe it through the unconscious.\n\nIn order to visualize the emotions in DEPTH,  have the process of consciously finding the landscape from the patterns drawn by the unconscious.\n",
