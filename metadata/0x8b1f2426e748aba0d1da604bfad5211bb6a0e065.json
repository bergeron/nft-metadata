Only in interaction with the world can you understand who you are, see yourself in the reaction of everything around you as in the reflection of a mirror. But you are also the creator of everything, because when you observe something you choose how to identify what you observe, this is what builds your reality and depends only on you who you are, because in fact it does not matter as it is only an invention",
