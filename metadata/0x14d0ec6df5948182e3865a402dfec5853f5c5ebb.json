    "description": "[I created an RGB under-lit “Hikaru Skirt” by sewing LEDs around the hem and placing the battery and control board in a 3D printed belt pack.\n](https://imgur.com/a/cAyO2)\n\nThe images of me modeling the skirt were stolen by a Chinese company to market an LED sex toy- which could not possibly have the same effect. The images have been passed around to so many distributors, and enforcement is so difficult in China, that there is little hope of taking them all down. \n\nUnfortunately, some corporate sponsors who have seen the images thought they were real- and canceled contracts.\n\nSo, how to flip the script on the various companies profiting from my stolen images featuring their product going viral? \n\nSell it as an NFT. \n\nSomeone gets to own a viral meme that has seen millions of likes and reposts, the information that my images were stolen and are a misrepresentation of my work becomes more widely known, and hopefully, I receive some compensation for what it’s cost me in work.",
