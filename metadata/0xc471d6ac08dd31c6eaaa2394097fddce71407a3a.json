    "description": "This work is a 3D-rendered corset that has been custom-made using a bust scan. Inspired by the functionality of exoskeletons, it symbolizes the casing and protective armor that has evolved and solidified over the years leading up to the moment of scanning. This intricate shell represents a lifelong process of breaking and regenerating, reflecting the transformative nature of existence and the eternal process of self-renewal.\n",
