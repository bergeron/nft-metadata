    "description": "Lauryn Hill once said “Music is suppose to inspire, how come we ain’t getting no higher” \n\nMy goal with music has always been to inspire and elevate us to a higher place, so I focus on themes of Love, Self expression, Revolution. I know the power of music because it has saved my life many times, and so I move through it with intention.\n\nBuilt for Greatness is a song to inspire and empower, I play it in the morning and to hype myself up in the gym and everywhere really. I want you to feel like you can do anything after listening to it, because you actually can. I believe self love is the key to solving all our problems. Because how we treat ourselves is how we treat others and all living things (the planet, animals, people). This song aims to aid in the self love journey. \n",
