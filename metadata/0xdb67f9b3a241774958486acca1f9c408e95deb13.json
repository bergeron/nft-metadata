    "name": "Solitude Tower",
    "description": "Solitude Tower stands tall and proud, a beacon of isolation in an endless sea. Built by an anonymous artist, the tower's minimalist design is a reflection of the artist's desire to escape the chaos of the world and find peace in simplicity. The tower's three stories, each one home to a different house, symbolize the artist's journey to self-discovery. The first house, is a reminder of the chaos and noise of the world the artist wanted to escape. The second house, on the second floor, represents the artist's longing for a simpler life, a life where you can escape the noise of the world and find your own path. And finally, the third house, on the top, is a representation of the artist's realization that true happiness can be found in the quiet moments of solitude. As you gaze upon Tower, you can't help but feel a sense of longing for a simpler life, a life where you can escape the noise of the world and find your own path. ",
