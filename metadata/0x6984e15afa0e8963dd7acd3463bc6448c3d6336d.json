    "description": "“Venice Canals” — 4k (3840 x 2160) | 3m. Ai neural style transfer treatment of footage of of the Venice Canals by Mohler in 2022. Video of the Venice Canals in Los Angeles fused with a photograph of a \"Rent a Surfboard\" sign on the boardwalk taken by Mohler in 2021. Part of the “Painted Cities” series which explores the imaginative qualities of machine intelligence to create the memory and dream states of a city through the fusion of motion and ink. The digital paintings are created using multiple forms of Ai, especially Neural Style Transfer, to fuse videos with ink, texture, and photographs often from the surrounding area. “Painted Cities” explores how machine intelligence can be used as a tool to extend our imagination. Part of the generative and Ai art movement. Sounds by Luke Mombrea.",
