    "description": "\"What were the skies like when you were young?\" - the orb\n\n100 Sunsets is an exploration of the feeling of sunsets, the transformation from day to night, the intersection of color, gradients & time. The work explores the atmosphere and uses colors derived from atmospheric optics.  \n\nThis summer, I spent some days living on a boat with my family, and I loved watching the sunsets on the water.   I found myself often transfixed, and invariably having the discouraging thought about how nothing I could code would even come close to the wonderful chaos, the noise and oscillations I was seeing on the water surface.  It would be impossible to recreate these looks.  But I remember thinking, would it be possible to recreate the feeling? \n\nThese studies are an attempt to capture the feeling -- of watching the sun set, of seeing a day end, and the start of something new. \n\nPress ‘h’ for high resolution, and ‘s’ to save an output image.",
