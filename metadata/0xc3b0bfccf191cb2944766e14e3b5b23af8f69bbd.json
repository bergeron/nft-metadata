    "description": "The FACTORY of big dreams\n\n\nPerformed by Celzidor Andrei and Nicolas Putzolu\nVisuals by Paweł Wilkos\nSong: Dazo L'oizeau - NI\n1/1 art\n\nWelcome to our FACTORY where we create, motivate and always find inspiration. This place is somewhere deep inside us and you.\nSOUND ON!\n\n\n\"Your mind is like a factory\"\nIt is a busy place, producing countless thoughts in one day. Let your thoughts create the reality that you want to see in your life. Give yourself space to think.\n\nIn April 2022 I invited Nico to Warsaw, Poland for this dance NFT project and, with the help of Paweł, we reached in the outskirts of the capital a very big (and abandoned) factory which inspired us and our dance moves very much.\nIt was really cold but dancing electro is always helpful in this kind of situation :)\n\nBonus content:\nThe winner of the auction will get \"behind-the-scenes\" footage as a gift and a high-resolution video file.\n\n\n#electrodance #danceNFT #celzidor #nico #NFT #factory #danceNFTs #dancer #dancers #airburner",
