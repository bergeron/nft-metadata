    "description": "“The way you call me honey\nThe way you’re outta money\nYet you still never have time to spend”\n\nYou know the drill: the kind of person who displays all the red flags and constantly hits you up, asking if you're down to chill? “FuckBoy” is all about the disappointment in those empty promises, toxic relationships, and what seems like the endless cycle of choosing the wrong type. \n\nIn the early months of the pandi, freshly locked down and in our endlessly productive zoom meetings, “FuckBoy” was created. At first, it was a song we had written to pitch for another artist, but through these past three years, it has become a favorite of mine to sprinkle in the encore at my live shows. \n\nHey friends! I’m SOZI! I’m a Music Artist, Songwriter, and Producer born and raised in Los Angeles. I’m so excited to drop this Sound Genesis and can’t wait to connect with all of you! Join my Discord so we can chat some more! ",
