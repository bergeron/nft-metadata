    "description": "While we pursue the convenience of the city life, we always need nature in spirit.\n\nI want to express that in this work.\nThe lights that fill the photo represent living in the city with a bright night like daytime, and the green in the cell phone represents nature. And the butterfly is our exhausted heart. They want to go back to nature.",
