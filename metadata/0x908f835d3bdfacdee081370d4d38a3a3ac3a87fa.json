    "description": "Mountains offer a wonderful sense of clarity, focus and calmness. Nowhere else in life do I feel more alive. These granite megastructures form a bridge between heaven and earth. To explore them requires voluntarily abandoning the comfort & security and acceptance of pain and incredible efforts - this way, they offer a fleeting glimpse, through rushing cloud and blowing mist, of a realm pure and unstained by the moral ambiguity of human affairs. These mountains of rock are the mirrors which helps us know ourselves better. It requires that we confront the reflection we find and work with all that is weak, lazy, and fearful within ourselves.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
