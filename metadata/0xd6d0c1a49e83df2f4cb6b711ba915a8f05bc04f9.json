    "description": "noun\n\nan-as'-tas-is. Noun Feminine. Definition. a raising up, rising (e.g. from a seat).\n\nAnastasia is derived from the Greek word 'anástasis,'' which means 'resurrection.'' In Slavic languages and English, it similarly means 'reborn.'' \n\nIn medicine, a condition of increasing health and vigor; convalescence.\n\nResurrection.\n\nPlural form of anastasi.\n\nWho the ‘f’?\n\n‘F’ nft holders and $ash community members merge together to release incredible art and a forward step into the future of the digital ERA; in addition to what @pak has in store\n\n(‘f’ & $ASH HODLER value).\n\nWhat the ‘f’?\n\nf-purpose: The Pak ecosystem was deeply affected by ASH2, and this drop will show how we come together as a community to show the power of the community. \n\nf-VALUES: Family, FRENS, fun, fairness, function, etc.\n\nManifesto:\n\nPAK performances art titled ‘f’, was a free drop that demonstrated the realness of FOMO. Some participated, some spectated others gave into fomo. Shortly after this nft was claimed a private portal in PAK discord opened: the ‘f’-chat. \n\nHere PAK welcomed the new partners and loosely implied the 50% partner parcel properties. With no promises, utility or roadmap; the f-collective is now forming from this community. With 1234 ‘f’ nfts as a free giveaway, a short window opened for ‘f’-holders to burn their nft for the $ASH. After an $ASH Chapter Two tornado DROP, causing the entire ecosystem to erupt; the ‘f’-collective is here to provide a solid foundation forward. Composed of creators, collectors & community this is a true decentralized venture that can blossom into something special.",
