    "description": "Designed and developed in Photoshop.\n\nFile Dimensions: **8921 px * 5376 px**\nFile Size: **16.1 MB | JPEG**\n\nI climb the steps to reach the top of this ladder made of steel and prop,\nWith every rung, I strive and cope to reach the highest peak of hope.\n\nI step on colleagues, friends, and foes and make them fall with every blow,\nI climb with greed and selfishness and leave behind my humbleness.\n\nI trade my soul for corporate gain and ignore the conscience of my brain,\nI work long hours and sacrifice the moments with my loved ones nice.\n\nI scale the height with ruthless might and never care for wrong or right,\nI forget my values and my pride and march ahead with ambition's stride.\n\nAnd when I reach the topmost rung and hear the cheers and praises sung,\nI realize that I'm all alone with none to share my glory throne.\n\nSo, if you seek success in life and want to climb the ladder's strife,\nRemember that it's not the height but the journey that's worth the fight.",
