    "description": "Flashback #1\n\n“November. The grayness outside the window. But there is an orange radiant doorway instead of my heart. It warms me and makes me happy. But I know soon it will end. This door shouldn’t be open for me. But I’m trying to keep as much of this warmth as I can. Doing so, I don’t notice that it burns me out. My flame is left to smolder in the meadow, no one knows for how long”.\n\nArtist: Juless.joy\n\nsize: 3880 x 4849px\n\nyear: 2020\n\nformat: JPG",
