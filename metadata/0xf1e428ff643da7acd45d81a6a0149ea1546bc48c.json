    "description": "There is no better painter than nature itself, and the Indian Peafowl is a testament to that. The iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, is quite a sight when in full bloom. With nature providing subjects such as this, one only needs to look closer and admire. In my effort to bring creativity to photography so that it can be called \"art\", the natural world continues to remind me that all that is required is the ability to see. \n\nEdition 1 of 1 Image Type: \n\nPNG Resolution: 3868x2484",
