    "name": "LionÂ´s impressive aura",
    "description": "Hey there! I captured this shot from a fully grown male lion on a 100 days wildlife project in 2019. I was travelling through South Africa to capture wildlife in all its beauty. The physical power of lions but also the aura of them is truely impressive. They are classified as apex predators which means that they have no natural enemies.\n\nAll funds will be used for further wildlife projects or to support wildlife sanctuaries. You can decide what you would like to support.\n\nSome of my works from this trip has been also requested and published by BBC-Earth.\n\nwarm regards\nSasan",
