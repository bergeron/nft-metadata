    "description": "The first lost sock in our collection. While we were looking for it enjoyed walks in the amazing world of the game Mario. Whether you played this game or not you probably heard from fans how interesting this universe is. So our sock is enjoying the arcade and traveling through the pipes, collecting stars and walking with Captain Toad. Maybe it'll even meet the princess herself.\n\nOur socks are not alone - they are travelers, but we want to help those who are really alone or have lost their home. We will donate a part of the paintings sold to a fund to help the homeless or people in dire straits. Donâ€™t forget it!\n\nCollection limited: 20 pieces",
