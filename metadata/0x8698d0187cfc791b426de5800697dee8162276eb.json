    "description": "This cinema graph with music is a collaboration between Rachel Wood and Matt Bednarsky\n\nThe photo was taken by Rachel on her first trip down the West coast of the USA in 2020. \n\nAfter waiting for hours for the light rays to happen, she was about to drive away in defeat when the forest suddenly became alive. Lesson learned, for there to be light rays, the sun needs to be high enough in the sky to shine through these tall trees.\n\nMatt is a Pop and Folk artist who has over 7 million streams on Spotify.  A talented musician with an interest in Web3, this is his first collaboration in the NFT space.\n\nA Warm Red\nWritten and produced by Matt Bednarsky\n\n\"A warm red, deep in your soul \nSinging with wonders unknown\nWhen you quiet down \nYou can hear a beautiful sound\nFrom a warm red, deep in your soul\"",
