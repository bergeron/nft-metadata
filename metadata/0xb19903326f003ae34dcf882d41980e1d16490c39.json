    "description": "The beautiful and curious spirit Kura (expressed as the koi fish) is endangered and alone until a goddess finds her. As she struggles to swim towards her, the goddess can't help but cry. Reciting a lullaby, the goddess gently lulls Kura into a water bottle to take her home with her. Every sunrise in her new home, she jumps out of the water in a joy to see her goddess, still curious and beautiful and now safe and loved.\n\nMade April 4th to May 4th 2023 using Procreate Pocket and Affinity Photo.
