    "description": "The flood destroyed cities and countries in the struggle with man, but after a while nature became bored and dreary, and she created a wonderful new life - Watty. Her heart is filled with love and unity with nature, water. She likes to float paper boats on the waves among these strange things sticking out of the water.",
