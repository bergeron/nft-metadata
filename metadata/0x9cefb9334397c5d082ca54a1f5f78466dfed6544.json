    "description": "| BEHIND SILENCE |\n\nI am not a yeller ,\nBut pain builds up in me,\nYou might see me smiling,\nBut I am screaming deep beneath,\nI keep my mouth shut,\nFinding silence as the key,\nLocking some emotions that may harm if free,\nDonâ€™t try to dig deep in me as fire may burn you too,\nLet me burn alone far inside,\nas my soul is now used to.",
