    "description": "‘Eternal Winter’ (2022)\n\nEdition: NFT 1/1\n\nArtist: Shaun Stewart\n\nThe Canadian Rocky Mountains hold a special place in my heart. Having spent two summers of my life living and working in Banff National Park, I have always desired to return during winter to photograph the majestic snow-capped peaks.\n\nThis mountain has captured my attention on numerous occasions while exploring in the park, but the conditions were never quite what I was looking for to photograph it. Finally, over five years since I first visited this location, I was able to capture the peak in all its glory.\n\nWaiting patiently from our vantage point, we watched the clouds roll through the mountains, snow blow from the ridges, and light dance across the towering peaks until at last, the sublime light illuminated Panorama Peak.\n\n",
