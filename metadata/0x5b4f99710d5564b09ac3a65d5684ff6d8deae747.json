    "description": "This series of photographs was produced in 2013 by a talented photographer, Sermkhun Kunawong. The photographs present the concrete (external state) and the abstract (internal state) of human on 3 elements, the body represents nature, shape, and shade of the human body, the mergence conveys fusion or being in each other between a woman and a man who blends together harmoniously, the soul reflects the human desire to be superior to ordinary.\n\nIn the series of the body, the artist has brilliantly placed shadows to show the perfect and pure form of the human body. \n\nBlue has always been a symbol of intelligence and authority; thus, it is the main tone of this series which can be noticed by the name “The Blue Man” \n\n“The choice of blue is a key element because it is my favorite color inspired by the sculptures of French artist Yves Klein, combined with a passion for cubism, this collection led to the creation of my collection.\" the artist Sermkhun Kunawong said.",
