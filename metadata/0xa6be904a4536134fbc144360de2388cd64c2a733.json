    "description": "A West Point grad and Commonwealth General, Mercer’s stoic leadership has served his people well. Clad in distinct armor, Mercer stands out as a unique soldier. A believer in teamwork, he has demonstrated the importance of unity throughout the hardened ranks of the army. With calculating prudence, Mercer navigates the Miltons’ bureaucratic rule within the walls of the Commonwealth, and seeks to deliver safety to the people under his protection. Now faced with looming political challenges and the influence of newcomers, the temptation to bend the rules in Milton’s empire has become stronger. Mercer marches into the Metaverse with this hand-sculpted 3D artifact, crafted with care and expertise by designers at Orange Comet. With every detail masterfully sculpted, this 3D digital likeness is a true high-value collectible.",
