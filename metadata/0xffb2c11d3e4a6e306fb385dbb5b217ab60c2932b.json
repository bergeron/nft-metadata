    "description": "\"Beyond the test of fire, defying the cycle of life, the phoenix is reborn from its ashes\".\n\nYou must have had many hardships in the past, that makes you feel suffocated, empty and lifeless. As the poet rightly says, \"Only the test of fire makes fine steel\", these life experiences make you stronger, to rise like a Phoenix, and to be reborn as gentle and pure like an angel.  \n\nThese paintings are reflections of my past where I try to portray these musings.\n\nMay the fireflies follow you, guard you and guide you towards the light!",
