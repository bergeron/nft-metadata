It has typical neo-historicist ornaments but also rare art nouveau details made of black ceramics and art nouveau colored glass above the door. The house is immersed in the background of the oak forest. The photo is part of a series awarded with the first place of the Sony World Photography Award in the professional Architecture category.",
