    "name": "New secular tradition",
    "description": "In today's dynamically changing world, the question of why we need tradition, whether we still need it and why, seems extremely topical and important. It is impossible to replace the tradition, often shaped for hundreds of years, with something new and artificial. Although we do not always remember about it, traditions, customs and values ​​inherited from previous generations define our identity - cultural, national, local or religious. Globalization and the ever-accelerating pace of life exacerbate the conflict between what is modern and what is traditional, awakening the need to return to the sources, the roots.",
