    "description": "Parallel 1 is an image from a series on the theory of Parallel Universes based on our decisions and actions.  These universes are constantly in flux yet all have some sort of relation to each other.\n\nAll of the images in the Parallel series come from the same negative, printed on silver gelatin paper, then processed through a chemically destructive bath called mordan√ßage.  The original images are simple black silhouettes that go through the chemicals, bleaching the image and causing the blacks (where the heaviest silver nitrate deposits live) to swell and come off the paper in vails.  These vails are then manipulated creating a completely unique photograph.\n\nThe idea of the parallel with this process is to take the same negative, the same image, and create an infinite amount of unique photographs that depict the idea of an infinite reality.  The NFT is just another step in this process, a completely unique digital object created around one single entity. ",
