    "description": "From the series \"Code Map\", portrait of Tokyo\n\nSize: 2000x 2500 pixels\n\nThe project considers 15 major cities in the world I've never been to before. I study the results of the influence of the algorithm of searching engines on the perception of visual information we are looking for online. The visuals that I have selected from each city using Google images were recycled into these still life photographs.  By means of texture, shape, and color, I create a new subjective atmosphere of places, produce new emotional reality for them after my digital trip. Then, I place it back, thereby creating a certain form of a cycle. The system that provided me with data acquires the same data in a reworked form.\n\nhttps://dubinkaitem.com/codemap/",
