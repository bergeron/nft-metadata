    "description": "I visited Cuba in January of 2020 and one early morning I took a stroll around Old Havana with my camera in tow. My first impression was that everything seems to slow down in Cuba, almost as if time has just stopped.\n\nAs I continued to get lost in the labyrinth of Old Havana, I came across this young boy sitting behind the wheel of a classic car pretending to drive, seemingly without a worry in the world. As I poked my camera through the passenger window, he threw a curious stare down the barrel of my lens, and at this moment I captured this photograph.\n\nSometimes in life, there’s no knowing where we’re going and there’s no certainty of what tomorrow holds. But in a positive light, we are still here on this earth, we are still breathing, and we have the choice to create magic today!\n\nI think it’s important to remember that at whatever stage of life we are in, we should be playful, stay curious, and not take life too seriously.\n\nTitle: There’s No Knowing Where We’re Going  \nArtist: Jonny Melon  \nEditions: 50/50  \nLocation: Old Havana, Cuba  \nYear: 2020\n\nThere’s No Knowing Where We’re Going is the first edition by Jonny Melon",
