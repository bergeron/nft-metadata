    "description": "This is one of five images I took of the local people on the Tonl√© Sap on my final journey back home. Though I was intending to visit again, my plans were squandered due to the pandemic.\n\nThis is a local fisherman with a boat full of small lake fish taking a rest. Temperatures here in the summer would reach 40 degrees Celsius easily (104 Fahrenheit). So warm in fact that the water itself would be hot to touch. There were times when we had to get out of our boat to push it through shallow waters caused by areas of drought.\n\nThe engines on the boats were modified car engines and howled and roared like Cerberus on steroids. It was known for the locals to modify engines for speed and for noise. Great during the day but utterly awful if you were trying to sleep at night!\n\nI dream frequently of the lake. There is not a day that goes by where I do not miss the intense heat of the sun beating on my back, the boat engines roaring past my ears and the children of the lake waving goodbye.",
