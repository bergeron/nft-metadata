    "description": "trying to get out of your Heaven, for your paradise is my hell. Your blessings are chains of my slavery, I desire Freedom, I desire to fly in the sky which is not belongs to you , I desire to be the god of my own to be your angel, I was shouting the truth But you muted me and named me the Angel of Malice.\n\nAngel of Malice, digital painting, sketchbook Autodesk, 2550 * 3300 pixels ",
