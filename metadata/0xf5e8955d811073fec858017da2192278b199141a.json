    "description": "There are moments in this life that are beyond words. Where beauty is unmatched, and the heart is stirred. In Iceland, under a full moon and October sky, a landscape of glacier ice shone vividly stretched out on the horizon as a swirling, rhythmic wave of light painted the night overhead. \n\nSpellbound and captivated, I sat on the shoreline taking in the ethereal dance. My first international Northern Light experience and the arctic dream I’ve been longing for finally realized.\n\nThis image was captured in a single frame and now serves as a personal reminder of how powerful these emotional connections we experience within nature can be. Moments that remain etched in our memories and our dreams, compelling us to chase that “feeling” time and time again.\n\nArtist: Jenna Dixon\n\nExtended Editorial License - This image can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
