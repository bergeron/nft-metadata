Knowing the story of how our movement came about and honouring the icon Marsha P Johnson - for me it's not about seeing how companies \"support\" us as allies, but rather to engage with our community more deeply, to share stories and exchange experiences and to rally together in our fight for equality. \n\nCommunion for the most part is a religious term, purposefully chosen as a conversation starter in regards to those who choose to oppress us for loving who we do and expressing who we truly are - now is not the time for division but a time to stand together. \n\nArt is activism, love IS louder.\n\nJ-A",
