    "description": "This is my first drop on Sound.xyz!\n\nI'm so excited to bring my music and world to web3 and give an opportunity to bring fans on as collectors and owners.\n\nThis song came from a place of heartbreak and loneliness through the lens of losing a hero. It was written in tears by a fireplace with my co-writer, Jesse Dueck. Both of us had recently lost a meaningful relationship and what started as a conversation of love and loss turned into a song and story about losing someone you can't replace - the Hero.\n\nThis is the second single I've released off my forthcoming debut EP \"From the Sun\". This record was produced and mixed by Will Kubley (PKA: bodyhaunt) and Ethan Roche (Heyboy), and mastered by Chris Gehringer. All sounds and samples created in studio with purpose.",
