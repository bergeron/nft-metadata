    "description": "Fingers separated one blue piece after another. The long and empty conversation that would never end went on and on. During this time, she explored every chip of dried paint on that phone booth. Inside those blue chips was brown, black rust. No wonder the paint couldn't protect and hide all the imperfection of the metal that had crept in.\n\n-So metaphorical. - She thought and accidentally said it out loud.\n-What?! Are you even listening to me? Stop acting like that, or else I will...\n\nWhy listen to any of this if you already know the end? An unknown bright light blinded her gaze. She turned and stared at the incredible shooting star. It was the light that made her turn away from the dried, rusty paint of the phone booth, leaving that voice behind, too. A voice that was as if it had never been familiar to her...\n\nThere is only her and that divine light. It's a good sign. She knew everything would be all right.",
