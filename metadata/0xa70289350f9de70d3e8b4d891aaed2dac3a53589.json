    "description": "Koyashskoe Lake. Crimean peninsula. â„–1\nA pink lake of incredible beauty. The lake is located in Kerch, on the territory of the Opuksky Nature Reserve. They call the lake pink because of the hue of the water. The Dunaliella algae, which produces beta-carotene, is responsible for the pink colour. The algae originated in the lake from a mud volcano beneath the reservoir.\nThe magical colour is also influenced by crustaceans, which produce enzymes and endow the mud with therapeutic properties. There is 340-400 grams of salt per 1 litre of lake water. The content is 20-25 times more than in seawater.\nLake Koyash is located in immediate proximity to the Black Sea and is separated by a narrow strip of land no more than 10 m wide. The lake is 4 km long, 1.5 km wide and about 70 cm deep.\n",
