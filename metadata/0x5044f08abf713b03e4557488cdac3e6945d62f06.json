    "name": "1982 Mouton-Rothschild",
    "description": "An extravagant Pauillac that opens with a Beethovenian grandeur sings in the key of C minor. Amazingly youthful, spring-like and lilting, the cedar-infused black fruit gives way to a contrasting, hymn-like tertiary subject: sweet tobacco, leather, graphite and mint, with its eccentric meter, rhythm, and thematic outline in place â€” Mouton is in perfect harmony, balance, and maturity.",
