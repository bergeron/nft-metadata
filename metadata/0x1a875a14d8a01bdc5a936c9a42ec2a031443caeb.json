    "description": "The former factory Aeronautica Caproni \n\nOnce it produced parts for fighter planes and other military aviation equipment and was one of the most important factories in this field during World War 2.\n\n77 years later: where concrete and glass once predominated, there is now an urban jungle. Such a contrasting and at the same time so harmonious combination.\n\nThe Motif was created in what is actually an inconspicuous pump house. The combination of the blue concrete walls, which received an interesting structure through the decay and the plants that in the light of the window slowly pave a way into the interior, result for me a work of art of the natural process of decay",
