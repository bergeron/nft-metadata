Since his youth he has always been an excellent tango dancer. Every weekend, despite his age, he is given permission to go out and go to the \"Plaza del Entrevero de Montevideo\" to dance Tango. He is always dressed like a tango gentleman from a bygone era.\n\nMontevideo, Uruguay 2019   Photography by Aaron Sosa  \n\nEdition of 15, when the editions are sold out, I will place the edition numbers on a random selection page and one lucky collector will receive a special 1/1 edition of a Valdemar portrait.\n\nThis selection will be posted on my twitter with screenshots.",
