    "description": "We always associate the Day with productivity or new beginnings and Night with horror or hardships. but Day and Night are both a part of the same world and a part of our lives.\nWhen the sun is up, there is energy, brightness, and life. And when the moon is up, there is quietness, coziness, and relaxation. \njust like the sun and the moon, Elly and Selene, although they never meet. they share the same sense of harmony and purpose. And they are indeed two parts of the same world.",
