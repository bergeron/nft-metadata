    "description": "The absolute truth about the falseness of rendered vertexes came to me while staring at the screen waiting for this piece to finish up rendering.\nEach subsequent pixel completed an image and each subsequent image completed the animation.\nI now understand and so do you.\nThe screen adores our addiction to the possibility of its true fantasy. It is pure love what we feel when the flashing colours illuminate our face. \nThe vertexes behind the pixels behind the render behind the sequence of images hide our naked soul.\nVertex is the answer.\n\n1080x1350 px\n120 frames at 12 fps",
