    "description": "This artwork was created for the exhibition \"I am...\" powered by Gxrls Revolution and Jean-Michel Pailhon.\n\nWho is Marzipan Physics? Is she a fictional character? A muse? An artist? An alien physicist? Is she my pseudonym? My alter-ego? My creation? The answer is: all of the above. I am her, and she is me. I am Marzipan Physics!\n\nIn this piece, Marzipan sits upon a giant atom, a symbol of physics and human’s ability to harness its power for both creative and destructive purposes (as well as reference to the famous Atomium monument, which inspired me as a child living in Brussels.) Floating next to Marzipan is Zowie, an astronaut she met when her spaceship stalled on VezX-54 Prime, a planet known for its multitude of bubbling geysers. Zowie repaired Marzipan’s ride and the two have been fast friends ever since.\n\nThis 1 of 1 digital work was hand-created using 3D and 2D software, assisted by AI, which generated background textures and concept art for the Zowie character. 3840 x 2160 px.\n",
