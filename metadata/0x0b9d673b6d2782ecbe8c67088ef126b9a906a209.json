    "description": "The Aurora Borealis, a gift of light and colour from our sun. Created from electrically charged particles flinged out from the sun due to solar storms. Crashing into our magnetic field and displaying colours of green and purple. From the softest streak of green, to a full coverage of the whole sky.\n\nNot everyone can witness this spectacle of light, since it is a phenomenon only visual close to the magnetic poles.\nAurora chasing and tourism is a big thing, and there is no wonder why. \n\nIn Asian culture the belief is that the lights were viewed as a battle between good and evil dragons who breathed fire across the sky. In Japanese culture, the belief is that a child conceived underneath the Northern Lights will be blessed with good looks, intellect and good fortune.\n\nLet your eyes and mind sink into the deep colours and patterns created naturally over the sky.\n",
