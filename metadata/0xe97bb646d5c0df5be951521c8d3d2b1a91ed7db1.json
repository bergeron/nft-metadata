    "description": "February 7th, November 7th... 9 months to the date from the first iteration of what Wakanomy was, to what Wakanomy is. I feel we’ve ascended on so many levels during this time. So many lessons learned, some the easy way, some the hard. The anticipation of giving birth to a new Wakanomy had my anxiety through the roof, but my anxiety turned into pure excitement of the unknown when I looked around and saw my Wakanomy family right there with me in the waiting room. Wakanomy Is A Process and we trust the process. Holders of Waiting Room In Space will have access to a token gated group AMA, by yours truly. I will share my experiences, what I’ve learned and what I've been through while building in web3. I’ll also answer any questions asked, doesn’t have to be topic specific. Thank you for believing in the vision. Thank you for supporting the vision. On my lowest days, this is what keeps me going. Thank you.",
