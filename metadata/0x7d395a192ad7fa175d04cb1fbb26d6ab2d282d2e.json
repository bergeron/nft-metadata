    "description": "I was in Trinidad back in 2018 when I met an older man sitting in the front of a little house. I start talking to him when I see his strong hands and details between the fingers. At this moment, I start taking photos and asking about the history behind. He was a ‘’Guajiro” all his life, working from morning to morning, and now, he needs a rest after a life working.",
