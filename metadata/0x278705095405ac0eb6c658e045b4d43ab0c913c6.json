    "description": "I want You to be reminded of out interconnection to everything that exists in this vast universe. I want You to know that there's no such thing as “self”. We exist in the mountains, animals, insects, clouds, and the sun in the same way all those things exist in us. But also, we exist in other people, our parents, our friends, people we don't personally know, even people we don't like, we all are connected.\n\nRealizing our true nature is the first step to stop blaming, killing and destroying everything and everyone around us. It is the first step towards healing our broken bonds from a place of love.\n\nThis is a piece inspired by Thich Nhat Hanh's teachings.",
