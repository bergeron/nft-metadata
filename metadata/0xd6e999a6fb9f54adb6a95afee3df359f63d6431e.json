    "description": "Mandelberg speaks:\n\nThis is about transience. I have no idea where I came from or who sent me to this place called Earth. I know my time is limited, life can be over at any second. I look closely at everything around me because my eyes will go blind one day. I take photographs of the things I see, I preserve moments, shapes, light. I combine pictures and create images that have never existed. I look at them and ask myself: ´what is The Reason I Exist?´. This is about eternity.",
