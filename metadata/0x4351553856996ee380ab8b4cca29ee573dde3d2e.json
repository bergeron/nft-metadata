    "description": "In the beginning, there was only one shape. It had the power to transform itself into any form it desired. It became a human, with all the complexities and emotions that came with it. It became an animal, with all the instincts and raw power that came with it. It became everything in between, and nothing at all. \n\nThis is the essence of the Humanimals collection - a celebration of the infinite possibilities of existence, and a reflection of the interconnectedness of all things. Through portraits that blend human and animal forms, the collection explores the similarities and differences between the two, seeking to capture the essence of each form and the beauty that arises when they are merged.",
