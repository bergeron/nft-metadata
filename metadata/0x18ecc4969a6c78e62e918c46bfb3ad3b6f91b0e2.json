    "description": "I met Nastya a few months ago when I joined the community, it's funny that we wrote messages to each other at the same time. I was attracted by her responsiveness, sincerity and support. All this I have felt throughout all these days here. That's what prompted me to buy one of her works. Subsequently, she also became my collector. In her works, she flawlessly displays the beauty of the female body, its fragility, tenderness, but at the same time incredible endurance. From the first seconds of our IRL meeting I realized that in front of me is a person close to me. She almost immediately started calling me \"elk\" - she thought I was much shorter and smaller, and this nickname was fixed on me. Even before we met, we decided to do this shoot, but I couldn't even imagine that all this would eventually turn into a real and strong friendship. I am glad to show you her as I saw her. With huge shining eyes and a completely unquenchable thirst for art. Fragile, but strong. Kind and empathetic.",
