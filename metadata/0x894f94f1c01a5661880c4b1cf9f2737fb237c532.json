    "description": "Spending the night under the stars is one of my favorite activities. I made a trip out to Colorado in 2019 and stayed in the mountains not far from Pikes Peak. On a clear night I captured the Milky Way with my star tracker and also captured Pikes Peak in the distance. The moon that night was setting so it painted a soft light on the mountain which I love. Once the moon set, I captured the Milky Way and blended it with Pikes Peak. This photo to this day is my favorite Milky Way photo I've taken. And I've taken a bunch of them!",
