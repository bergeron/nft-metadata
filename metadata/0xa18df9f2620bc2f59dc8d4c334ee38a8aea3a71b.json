    "description": "A new multidisciplinary work where each element has its unique meaning.  \nFirst level: The waves, they symbolize the environment for an artist to try to balance his work with marketing every time he has to.  \nSecond level: The good and the bad, these opposite sides, we never recognize at first but with time we get saturated with.  \nAnd finally the last level, which is the artist, he who feels the competition and always competes with other artists rather than himself, in hopes of elevating his craft.  \nEnjoy!!!",
