    "description": "The plot is transparent in the art.\nThe problem is as old as the world. The problem of domestic violence.\n1 out of 2 children (1 billion children) suffer some form of violence each year.\nStranger children are harder to help. But you can help your own child.\nI feel very sorry for the girl in the picture. I want to protect her, but I can't.\nBut I will do everything possible to prevent this from happening to my child.\nBeing a parent is hard, but it's our choice. A child is a privilege.\nLove your children! ",
