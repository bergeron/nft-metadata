    "description": "Collection of digitized linocut artworks.\n\nShe ran away from Africa when she was 13. She went through the refugee camp to save herself and to be able to help those who stayed at home.\n\n​She has a name but I will not say it because it’s non the one-person story but all those boys and girls who have a dream and ready to fight for it.\n\n​She looks at you with a child eyes: shy, timid and afraid. But at the same time you feel her courage and audacity; she is ready for revolt and she will be a Star, for sure!\n\n​The first paintings were monochrome (limited editions of 9 pieces, 100х70сm each). After I started adding colors and textures, combining different colors of paper and materials (banknotes, a pack of coffee, metal of cans). As a result – collection of unique artworks united by this Girl in a turban.\n\n[See art collection website for full description](https://www.girlinaturban.com/)",
