    "description": "This picture was made with Stable Diffusion. It's a 2688x1536 pixels \"painting\".\n\n\"Dust\" can depict a number of different scenarios. The fight could be sparked by a variety of reasons, such as disagreement, conflict, or competition. Perhaps these men are trying to help each other. It could be a dance, a sacred dance, or a funny one. \n\nBut where does the orange dust wind come from?\n\nFor me, Art must be a little bouquet of possibilities. One can wonder what it is really about, and what does the artist want. I kind of like that.",
