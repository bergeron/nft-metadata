    "description": "Doofan has two amazing friends who have been by her side since she lost her Dad after the Fulani herdsmen clash in Benue state, Nigeria\n\nTo her left is Ngufan, who helped her interpret what I said in English to their local language as she could not understand English properly\n\nAnd to her right is Doose, who supported her while I listened to her touching story\n\nThey share this great bond and I could not help but capture that bond in a photograph\n\nNow each time I look at this image, I remember exactly how I felt that day seeing these girls help their friend Doofan\n\nI have learned that in life, we all pass through so many difficult situations and all we may need at certain times is that friend that we can count on \n\nDoofan may not have everything that she desires yet but she has something that a lot of people don’t have, ‘True Friends.’",
