    "description": "Anecdote: I went to the market to buy plain bread and rice. Just like every other day, I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans, and when I passed people in the aisle, they gave me a faint smile, but otherwise paid me no mind. When I got home, I made a ham and cheese sandwich, and I washed it down with some 2% milk. Afterwards, I had a medium-sized serving of vanilla ice cream as a treat. Nothing very exciting ever happens to me, but I don’t mind. I’d say I’m the most-average average guy there is.",
