    "description": "While I continue to grow up and be a teenager, I feel so many emotions all at once. The good, the bad, the crazy. It’s hard to pinpoint where everything stems from. I tend to struggle with how fast time flies by, too busy focusing on trying to slow down the present, that I miss what’s already happened. And there are times where I find people questioning my beliefs, or my feelings towards others. As humans, we are constantly juggling so many different aspects in our life, trying to find a balance. \n\nDevan and I love this track. We make all our music together and give it our all every time. Magic is the only outcome. I like to think that this song creates an escape for all of us. Or even a safe place to be ourselves. A place to finally exhale. Without judgment, without fear, without stress, and without worries. \n\n‘Don’t Have to Explain’ spreads a little light on all the flourishing stresses we have. About making decisions, wanting to pause and be in the moment, and even protecting our own space. We should never feel obligated to have to explain ourselves. We should be open and understanding of each other. We should encourage and learn from one another. \n\nBe present.  \nBe mindful. \nBe grateful. \nWhen you listen to this song, know that you are here. \nAnd you don’t have to explain a thing. \n\n- mia lailani & devan ibiza \n<3 \n",
