    "description": "The most famous Oscar ceremony clip in history, depicted in the simplest way possible: two sticks dancing around each other.\n\nThe primary purpose of this piece is to determine if the media, and the internet, have done a good enough job that almost anyone can recognize the reference clip when they see it.\n\nThe second purpose of this work is not to blame the actor for his act, but to point out what the media and the web are doing with it, and how fast and far things are going on the internet... without a very solid reason behind it.",
