    "description": "In this digital painting, one Black boy is depicted sporting an afro and a patterned sweater, with a vacant gaze and his hands clutching on his pacifier. He stands in front of a background of colorful paint splatters and is protected by two gold rings. This painting was created to highlight the challenges faced by young Black boys in the United States and across the globe. It shows how soon innocence can be stripped away and the weight of the world given in exchange.",
