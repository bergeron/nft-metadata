    "description": "1997 Was a momentous year for Tony Stewart in the Indy Racing League. He earned his first IRL career win when he grabbed the checkered flag at Pikes Peak (lead 193 of 200 laps). Even greater, Smokeâ€™s season-long dominance led to his first and only IRL championship - which is celebrated in this original NFT. Tony Stewart is the only driver in history to win a championship in both IndyCar and NASCAR.",
