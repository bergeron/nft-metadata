    "name": "New Ophelia",
    "description": "Many people know the Ophelia painting by the young artist John Everett Millais in 1852.\nBut have many wondered about the history of this painting, who was the model that Millais posed to create Ophelia, and how did it happen?\n Elizabeth Siddal, the 19-year-old model who posed for Millais in the studio, had a difficult time. Dressed in a vintage dress, she was lowered into a tub filled with water and warmed with candles. One day the candles went out and the water gradually cooled down. The master, who was engrossed in his work, did not even notice it. The girl did not dare to interrupt the inspiration of the painter and became seriously ill. \nI decided to make my own version of Ophelia, but what would it have looked like if  Siddal had posed in another century, in a beautiful copper and pewter bath with a wrought iron stand.\nI redesigned the bathroom twice, then it took me 2 days to find the right fabric for the dress and another week to work out the details. Here is my \"New Ophelia\".",
