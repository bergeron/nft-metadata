    "description": "Not just 'color', these two colors actually symbolize psychological effects that you often don't realize.\n\nRed is a warm and positive color that is often associated with a physical need and a desire to survive.\nThe color red also emits energy that triggers our emotions and motivation to act.\nSo you could say, red is often used by those who are confident, brave, and have a leadership spirit.\n\nMeanwhile, black color is a color associated with hidden, secret and unknown things.\nFor this reason, people who wear black are synonymous with mystery.\n\nDate Created : 12/03/23\n6144 x 4096 px",
