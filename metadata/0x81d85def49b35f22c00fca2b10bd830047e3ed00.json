    "description": "A dark, foggy morning, minutes before the sunrise. I'm sitting on a train to Budapest. Nothing as far as the eye can see, just us, speeding through the cold and frozen void. I'm finding peace in this loneliness.\n\nThis animation is the first in Anywave, a collection inspired by a person's mood swings during their daily routines. Each piece depicts the experience of an unlikely feeling during everyday moments, abstracting the scene to a sensory minimum.\n\n2000x2000 px looping, animated piece.\nParanoidAnyway, 2021",
