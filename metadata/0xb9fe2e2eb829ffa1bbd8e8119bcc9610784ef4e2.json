    "description": "For me, color is a metaphor for life because like the seasons of the year, life also has its seasons.\nThis work of mine is a hymn, a tribute to life, to hope, to movement.\nI represented the colors and the symbolism that distinguishes them individually, through my abstract photographic works, but drawn from reality, from uncontaminated nature and my favorite source of inspiration.
