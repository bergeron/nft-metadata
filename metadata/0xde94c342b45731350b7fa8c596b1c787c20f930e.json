    "description": "Someone said it's going to be hard, but we follow our dreams anyway.\n\nSometimes we cry, but we get back up and come back stronger.\n\nSomeday we know, we are all gonna make it... in our own ways.\n\n\"The moment we believe in ourselves is magic\" \n\nSize 2398 x 3508 px\n600 DPI\n\nThis is NFT with utilities such as art/ marketing online course access. More details at...\n\nhttps://ctclockwises.com/ctclockwises-nft/\n\nP.S. This piece is super “SPECIAL.” Since my YouTube community and I love to support small artists, we therefore commissioned FROST (@1__0RST3R on twitter) to partially color this piece. We therefore have such amazing coloring mood and a stunning background.\n\nWe hope that once this piece is sold, it can be one of the examples of why people should hire artists. \n\nUltimately, I wish 'WAGMI' will become a reality to everyone :)",
