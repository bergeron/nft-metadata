    "description": "This limited-edition 1/1 'Glitched' Hex'd is a gift to early collectors of The Hex'd NFT project by artist Joshua Van Horsen. These 1/1 “Glitched” Hex’d are actually part of the original HEXD contract that was paused indefinitely due to a glitch in the codebase. 35 Hex'd were minted off the original contract before the issue was found. Thank you for being a collector.",
