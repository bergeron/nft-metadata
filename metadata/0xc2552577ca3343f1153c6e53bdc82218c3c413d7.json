    "description": "Dante's First Circle of Inferno - Limbo, is resided by virtuous and unbaptized pagans, who did not accept the Christ, but were not sinful enough to warrant damnation. The first circle is entered after crossing the Acheron river ushered by Charon. \nThere is a castle of seven calls that has the light of reason illuminated fresh meadows which acts as the dwelling place of many shadows.\nThere is no tourment here, only sorrow. The only punishment here is the lack of choice to enter heaven. ",
