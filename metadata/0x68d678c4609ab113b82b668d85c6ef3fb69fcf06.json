    "description": "V3  \n“Punk Gradient” started with still images which are specifically generated from gradient colors. This series includes visual narratives from different periods of punk culture and alternative production of vision. When the forms are integrated with design, “Punk Gradient” has its language of color. As a reminder of the proponents of De Stijl in a new age version, it advocates pure abstraction and completeness by a reduction of the essentials of form and color. Visual compositions of new “Punk Gradient” are simplified with visual compositions which is the vertical, horizontal, and destructive side of using specific aesthetic colors of Punk's primary colors.\n\nV1 on screensaver.world  \nV2 on opensea",
