    "description": "They pose for me. They move with every blink. They know the transience of each moment. Me too.\n\n In a split second, the light changes. I don't mind. \"You have to realize quickly, everything begins to disappear\" said Cézanne.\n\nThere are parts of me in them, even my name.\nBut those are not my features. Or are they? It´s me?
