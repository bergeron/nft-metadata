    "description": "I have been living in UAE for the last 20 years (2002-2022), have witnessed the major development in UAE including the world's tallest building Burj Khalifa. \n\nIn this collage, i have included 33 photographs of Burj Khalifa from 2005 to 2009 in different stages of its construction from different angles. In addition to that 17 photographs of developing Dubai included to complete a total no of 50 photographs.\n\nWhy 50 photos?\nUAE just celebrated its 50th National Day, I wanted to make NFT of 50 photographs as a tribute showcasing its development through my camera.\n\nAll the photographs are taken by me using different cameras Olympus, Sony, Canon etc.\n\nItâ€™s a unique 1/1 Edition\n\nPhotographer: Adarsh Kuruvath | metadarsh.eth\n",
