    "description": "A lost soul drifts through the Chromosphere in search of other lost souls, which she calls Animas. These souls are easy to spot because they are made of chrome and are very reflective. They float on the wind, looking for other souls who will join them. As they explore the Chromosphere, they learn more about the different places and creatures they meet on their journey. They explore the different and mysterious levels of the Chromosphere and learn how to traverse different levels. They also explore the different paths that can be taken to find their way to a certain place. As they travel, they keep picking up new souls to accompany them on their quest.",
