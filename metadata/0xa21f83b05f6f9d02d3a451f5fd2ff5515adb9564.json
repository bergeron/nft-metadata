    "description": "Running in Circles is the constant process of death and rebirth. The shedding of ones ego as they get closer to their true self. Don’t be afraid to become who you truly are. I know it’s scary, but on the other side of that metamorphosis is something beautiful. You’ll lose friends, maybe family members, and ultimately you’ll lose yourself.  Im here to tell you its okay. For what you’ll find are friends, a family, and a self who loves you for being you. \n\nIn order to progress through this journey you’ll have to make the ultimate sacrifice and burn each track. Leaving behind your old self to emerge anew. \n\nBurn to redeem Track #1 here - https://app.manifold.xyz/br/track-1-awaken\n\n",
