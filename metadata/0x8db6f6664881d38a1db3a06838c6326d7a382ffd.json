    "description": "1/4 F2.8 ISO 320 CCT 5450\n\nAll passing sceneries are captured with the same setting. Tunnels and rural areas are underexposed, and stations and cities are overexposed. They are full of variables like speed, angles, and lights. By adding one constant value, these photos represent the world without auto-correction.\n\nYou can not see the stars with dilated pupils for a bright street. Our eyes smart enough to ignore unwanted objects in the frame. You still admire the sunset blocked by electrical wires and trashes on the ground. We live in the processed world in a way. Discriminations, poverty, wars, we can easily ignore what we donâ€™t wish to see.",
