Am I the product of this System?\nAnd maybe I will have this greatest wisdom\nTo understand...\nIt's always been just me.\"\n\nTo create this work, I was inspired by the question of the rapid entry of Artificial Intelligence into our lives.\nThe indisputable fact is that this has facilitated, and in some cases even made it possible in principle to\nperform complex monotonous operations instead of a person. And over time, these operations become more and more complicated. Artificial Intelligence is being trained and in the near future will be able to replace a person in almost all jobs. This picture offers a fantasy of what will happen to humanity in a few hundreds of years if we do not take into account the risks that may arise with the thoughtless introduction of AI.\nShakespeare's Hamlet was taken as the basis for the performance.\nItem resolution of 2500x2100. The high resolution Jpeg and a little surprise will be send to the owner.",
