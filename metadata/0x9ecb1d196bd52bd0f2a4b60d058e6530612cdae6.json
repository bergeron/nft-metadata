    "description": "\"How Ya Doing Baby?\"\n\nInspired by the fourth track off of Balt Getty's Sad Boy LP, 'How Ya Doing' is the story of a passionate love that ended but never lost its luster. Time has passed, but when the lovers reunite the feeling continues as though nothing has changed.\n\nA glance into each others eyes, a touch, and one simple question - 'How Ya Doing?' Getty's icy cool way of capturing this emotion through minimalist production and simple yet poignant lyrics is a hallmark of the Sad Boy project as a whole. Capture this moment for yourself in this one of one audio-visual NFT.\n\nThe first buyer of this collectible will receive -\n\n1. [Sad Boy Hoodie](https://www.purplehausrecords.com/product-page/sad-boy-hoodie \"Sad Boy Hoodie\"), signed by Balthazar Getty\n2. A lossless WAV file of the song\n3. A high-res video",
