    "name": "Portrait of Salome",
    "description": "The young and beautiful jewish princess Salome is known in the history of iconography as the woman who took the head of John the Baptist, but when the image of Salome was reproduced in a theatrical work by Oscar Wilde in the Victorian era, the archetype of a strong femme fatale was re-established as a woman who is insensitive to authority and depends on her freedom. Nowadays, this archetype is tried to be suppressed in a way that is not very different from the old periods within the patriarchal system. However, all the conditions necessary for a woman to create her own portrait will continue to exist within this archetypal image and the reconstructed story. The new portrait of Salome makes him cease to be an object of desire, and in this new fiction Salome refuses to play the role of the image that satisfies her ambitions over a man.\n\nOil on canvas, 80cm x 105cm, 2020\n\n\nOptionally, the picture can be physically given to the buyer.",
