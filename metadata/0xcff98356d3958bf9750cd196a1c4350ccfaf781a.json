    "description": "Digital Artwork, Physical Painting: Mixed Media on Canvas, 240x200x4cm.  \nThis digital artwork is part of a cooperation between the artist Hoker One (Steffen Mumm) and arttrade. Participants have the opportunity to invest in a physical painting and receive one of the 80 heads depicted on the real work. The work fractionalized by arttrade is part of the exhibition “Wonderwalls” (Selim Varol Collection) at the NRW Forum Düsseldorf until 05.02.2023.  \n“Steffen Mumm, also known as HOKER. The German artist lives and works in Düsseldorf and is also internationally known and active. With roots in the graffiti scene, passion for calligraphy and much study of illustration, you can find a symbiosis in his work today. In addition to large sprayed “Calligraphy” lettering, he is known for his “HEADS”, which are created from his graffiti tags and illustrations. They can be found today on canvases, vases, sports cars and numerous house walls around the world.”",
