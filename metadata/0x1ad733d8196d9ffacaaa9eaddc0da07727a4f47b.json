    "description": "This digital performance borrows the teachings of sacred geometry to explore the creative potential of the sphere and the complexity that resides within it. \r\nThrough balance and order, we can reveal the creation of complexity.\r\nThe rendition of universal geometry in this virtual installation merely reveals the inherent complexity of the spheres by applying the teachings of Euclidean space. \r\nThis process is achieved without artificial effects and follows the orders and efficacies of pure materials, which thus manifest in a cyber-simulated realm with light, atmosphere, and aura. Just like the spheres, the individualâ€™s true potential can only unfold in resonance with others. \r\n\n\r\nBehold one of the basic, yet most complex geometrical bodies: the sph3re. \r\nThis token can only reveal its true potential once shared. \r\nIts purpose is to create new ash holders but you may use it to reward existing ashlings. \r\nThe choice is yours.\r\n\n\r\nthespheres.xyz",
