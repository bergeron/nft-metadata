    "description": "This collection of 35 skylines was created while working on an art commission for the Louis Vuitton location in Köln, Germany.\n\nThese abstract interpretations of the Köln skyline and its mix of medieval and modern spires were created using analog, in-camera techniques. Using an iterative process, I manipulated various plastics, color gel sheets, and lighting sources in front of the lens to create distortions and gradients resulting in these colorful, impressionistic treatments of the iconic skyline.",
