    "description": "Kowloon Walled City was the densest place on earth. It was a hastily put together conglomerate of tiny apartments, one on top of the other, caged balconies slapped onto the sides and connected through a labyrinth of damp, dark corridors. \n\nThis informal city was not only a hotbed for organized crime, but also a vibrant community of commerce and hope.\n\nNot to say that this wasn’t home to a lot of people and that no “fond memories” were formed there, but still, like all slums, it was a tough place to live, fraught with contradictions in the haze of hope for a better life.\n\nArtwork Spec :\n3000px X 3000px\n300 dpi\nedition : 1/1",
