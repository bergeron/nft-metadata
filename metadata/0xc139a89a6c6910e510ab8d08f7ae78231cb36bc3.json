    "description": "Jump ship is the first release from the illusive Groggy Jones under Ollie Chanin’s Stone Face Records. Capturing Groggy’ ethereal style and earthly influence, Jump ship is message in a bottle from Groggy to his lost love waiting for him on his home planet. Combining jazz and R&B with electro soul, Groggy’s Yxesosian roots make for an unforgettable sound that leaves the listener feeling deeply harmonious with the universe.\n\nGroggy Jones is a musician and producer from the planet Yxesos, where music is an integral part of daily and spiritual life. Groggy's love for music was amplified when he discovered Earth's diverse range of genres through his cosmic radio. Driven to experience it firsthand, Groggy used the forbidden \"tempo tether\" to travel through space and time, landing in New York City. Due to the lack of harmony on Earth, he is unable to use the “tempo-tether” to return home. After being stuck on Earth for 32 years, feeling defeated and hopeless, Groggy meets Ollie Chanin, who reignites his hope and encourages him to reach for the stars.\n",
