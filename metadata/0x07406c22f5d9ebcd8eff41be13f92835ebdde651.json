    "description": "I panick each time the door creaks open and reveals your terrifying presence. The trauma it brings, the pain it ignites, the scar it leaves on my already battered soul, the darkness that beclouds the tiny space you left for me, has made me the shadow of myself. Oh! How can i be free from this anguish of your constant abuse? Happiness, laughter, love and care, fled my life the day u took control over me. My worth is like spilt milk on rocks and all my six senses are bruised beyond repair. What is my crime? trust, love, loyalty and patience? I doubt i am still sane. The stigma of your abuse sticks fast.\n\nEdition : 1/1 \n  \n\n**Artist Details**: \n\nName: Emmanuel Odu \n  \n\nTwitter: [@soldiersfromth](https://twitter.com/soldiersfromth) \n   \n  \n\n**License** : Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
