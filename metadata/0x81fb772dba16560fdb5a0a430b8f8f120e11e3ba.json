    "description": "Long ago, there was a strong storm at sea. The waves rose and the sky darkened. People were afraid. But there was a reason for this storm. Poseidon, the god of the sea, had been separated from his lover Amphitrite and this storm was an attempt to win her back.\n\nPoseidon decided to do everything he could to lure Amphitrite by transforming into a beautiful young woman. But this woman was not really human. She was Aphrodite herself, the goddess of beauty and love. Poseidon cunningly flirted with her and eventually won her over.\n\nAphrodite fell in love with Poseidon while he was with her and they had a child together: a baby girl. Aphrodite wanted to give this child to the people of the world and she left the child in the sea. The sea carried her safely and dragged her to the shore. There, a farming couple found the baby, cared for her lovingly and raised her. This child was the goddess Aphrodite herself, the symbol of beauty and love.",
