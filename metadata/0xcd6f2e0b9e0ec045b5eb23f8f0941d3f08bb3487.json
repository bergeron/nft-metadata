    "description": "I visited the border with Poland and Ukraine this month to document the ongoing refugee crisis as a result of the Russian invasion in Ukraine. \n\nMore than 3 million people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries due to the war happening right now, most of whom are mothers doing everything it takes to keep their families safe.\n\nBetween assignments I made this portrait series of people boarding trains and buses from Przemy≈õl, Poland, on their way to other destinations around the country and Europe. \n\nThe images are named after the Ukrainian cities that have been hit the hardest since the war began. \n\n50% of the proceeds of this series will go to the International Committee of the Red Cross, currently providing aid to the mothers and children fleeing the country.",
