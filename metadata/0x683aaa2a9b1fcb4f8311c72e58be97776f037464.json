    "description": "Observing Ditema tsa Dinoko/Isibheqe as a language whose essence is codified with KwaNtu spiritual practices, Baba Tjeko engages how the geometric motifs take on both contemporary and historic meanings. \nThe piece is a reimagination of how the Ditema artform would have evolved from days of old to now. \nAs a digital representation, Tjeko's voice presents  visceral colour schemes that are punctuated by movement to further illustrate the evolution of the language.",
