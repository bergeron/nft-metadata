    "description": "The NFT community is like a big exciting race from earth to infinite space!\nCollectors, artists and simply spectators in one continuous race.\n\nI worked on every detail of this piece for a very long time trying to achieve the smoothest animation possible, and each character was reworked more than once.\nI had to strike a balance between detail and movement, because too much detail would turn the smoothest animation into chaos.\nAt the same time, I wanted every pixel of the artwork to move, sparkle, stretch, and change, for the artwork to be alive.\n\nAfter all, that's what our NFT community is - diverse, numerous, and never standing in one place.",
