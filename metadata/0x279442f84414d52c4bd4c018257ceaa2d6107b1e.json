    "description": "The Mask, 2023\nBy Zak Krevitt and Spasi Sohrani\n\nExpansive identity is nuanced, messy even. Emotion can overwhelm us or embolden us, twisting our personality, or defending our safety. We are trying on masks imbued with different purposes to navigate the world. What is the sense of self in all of this? \n\nThe ceature in this artwork manifested in an aggressive form, teeth bared and eyes trained wide. Is the monster attacking, or protecting? Are you wearing the mask, or observing it? Is this a private inward feeling, or a public display?\n\nA physical mask by Spasi Sohrani, then we held a photo shoot w/ the mask, and finally, I created a custom AI model with the photos to arrive at this artwork. \n\nThis process was alchemical, a transference of energy across people, cultures, and dimensions.\nWe gave birth to a new being, a creature that could now inhabit an infinite number of invocations while retaining its core identity. Our creature begins its long journey here, as The Mask.",
