    "description": "Pictured here is Viviana in her home environment. This image was taken at her home in Orlando, FL. It's the first of the collection. It was shot on expired 35mm film. Her birthday was coming up and she asked if the shoot could include cake. Of course, I said \"Yes\".\n\n\"Home\" is a collection by photographer David Lawrence. It explores the sacredness (and humor) of nudity and sexuality in the context of someone's home environment. The images in this collection are meant to be raw, personal, and honest in how they convey the human experience.\n\nThis image was shot in August of 2022 using an expired roll of 35mm film. Scanned and developed by Indie Film Lab.",
