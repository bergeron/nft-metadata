    "description": "The DEPRI MATES project consists of a series of portraits that appear humorous and playful at first glance but reveal a deeper meaning upon closer inspection. The figures, referred to as \"DEPRI MATES\", portray human inadequacy in dealing with the pace of digital possibilities. The figures reflect the volatility of the crypto market and the overload of available information on the human mind â€” the bipolarity, the oscillation between mania and depression, and the constant fear of missing out. They document our human reality in transhumanism.\n\nLicense: Non-Exclusive Commercial Rights (Creator can terminate license for hate speech).
