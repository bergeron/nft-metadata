    "description": "I cared, raised, loaded them to truck and brought to the city. Here are my sacrificial animals\nI don’t exactly know how much they weigh, as much as your eyes see\n\nIt’s delicious if you ask about meat, they ate grass of upland. There is a river above the village, they drank water from there\n\nGive me your hand, let’s deal, I have people to feed\n\nI’ve lied here for days, flies and bugs with me at nights. My bed is not comfortable, but I brew tea, it tastes good with sugar\n\nWhen the sun goes down, townsmen leave, the square is left to us. It becomes quite like my village. The air here is not clean but I dive into the lights of the city\n\nMy journey starts on feast day before noon. I dismantle my tent and load it. I drive for 18 hours in a narrow seat without sleeping. Sometimes on wet sometimes on icy roads\n\nI am human too, I have children and my wife. I have a mother I miss and my father\n",
