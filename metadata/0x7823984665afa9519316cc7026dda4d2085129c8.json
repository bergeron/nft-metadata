    "description": "The story tells of a very wise and wise princess, her name is Princess Mandalika. She is the daughter of a king, namely King Tonjang Beru who once ruled in the land of Lombok.\n\n\"The Bau Nyale\" tradition is a legend that is preserved in Lombok and is used as an annual party in Southern Lombok. Bau means catch and Nyale is a type of worm that is believed to be the incarnation of a princess.\n\nThis tradition began to be developed around the 16th century, namely after the princess made the decision to sacrifice herself.\n\nUntil now, the \"Sasak\" tribe still lives and continues to support the various cultures and regional traditions they have. One of the traditions of the Sasak tribe is the \"Bau Nyale Tradition\" which is inherited by the Sasak people.",
