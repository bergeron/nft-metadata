    "description": "Future Encounters is a photography practice project that explores the relationship between women and technology in post-human feminist vision. From the natural ecological relationship between women and all living creatures, to the self-exploration and self positioning of women in the human river, and the new alliance of feminism in network technology, she has put forward new questions and thoughts on women's identity and self-identity in the face of the development of modern network technology.\n\nSize: 6837Ã—5467 px",
