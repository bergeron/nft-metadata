    "description": "A rose is never just a rose. In this case it is the rose par excellence. It is the Italian flower. It has the Italian colours, those colours recalling the Italian patriotism that is well known worldwide and that is able to describe who we are, what we are, what we are capable of. We see a rose of white and pink gold, a bright rose made of gemstones set with finesse and craftmanship. We see a rose recalling the apotheosis with which Salvador Dal√¨ painted the Meditative Rose. In this case the highest and most engaging culmination is triggered by an NFT which is different from anything you could have ever imagined. You can smell its fragrance, you can touch the softness of its petals, you can feel its vital force. It will not wilt, as our Italy will not, as none of us would want. As jewelry is immortal par excellence, this item will not never die, but it will keep gaining value. The surprise you do not expect is to receive it even physically, to place it on the table, to touch it, to really feel it in your hands. This is not just an NFT."
