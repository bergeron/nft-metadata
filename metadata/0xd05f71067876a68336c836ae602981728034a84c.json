    "description": "Genesis Cryptorunners are Hackers that fight against the Big 5 Corporations of the [2112.run](http://2112.run) universe. The collection is divided into 5 Factions: The Punks, The Makers, The Guild, The Cyphers and The Stray Dogs. \n\nThe faction of the minted NFT is random and each piece has a unique hand-painted style never seen before in NFT projects.\n\nThis collection is the key to the entire 2112.run universe, and with it you will be able to:\n\n- Play the game that will come out in March, in which you will hack into corporate servers and earn $DATA tokens.\n\n- Validate your NFT on Discord and participate in the holders section and giveaways.\n\n- Take part in immersive roleplaying Discord Events with prizes.",
