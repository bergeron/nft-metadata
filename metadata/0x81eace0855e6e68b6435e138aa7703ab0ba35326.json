    "description": "How is the contemporary world evolving and what will happen in the future? There are always positive and negative implications in any change of course, and with this story, which is narrated through the blockchain, Orlandin will give you a glimpse of what awaits you. At the beginning we are always skeptics, and we see any new setting in a diametrically opposite way to reality. It will be a head, placed in the middle of an assembly line and alienated from itself and its setting, to explain to you how much analyzing and understanding the present can be functional to your growth and to the opening of new scenarios. This is a primordial \"photograph\" of the future that accompanies you towards the discovery of that parallel world we called the metaverse.\nPOWERED by ITALIANFT.ART\n\n",
