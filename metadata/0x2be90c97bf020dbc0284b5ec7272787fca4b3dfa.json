    "description": "Roe in the grass. Black and white photography. (2012)\n\nAs the dawn light kisses the cold November hills, I wander alone, lost in the majesty of the landscape. Suddenly, at the curve of the hill, a tapestry of beauty unfolds before me. My heart races as I snap shot after shot, trying to capture the raw, intimate imperfection of the moment. These precious creatures, so at home in the wild, are a gift to my senses, a reminder of the breathtaking world that surrounds us.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
