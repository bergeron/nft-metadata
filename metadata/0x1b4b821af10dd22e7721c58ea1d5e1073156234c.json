Downtrodden by their humiliating fate, these Nymphs sink into the bowels of the earth, firmly sheltered by the indifferent parent rock. Itâ€™s covered by heavy sheets of soil that resemble red velvet generously anointed with a thick layer of nutritious humus. Cracked relic slabs, decorated with scarce unidentifiable ornaments, act as frosting on top. Together, these disjointed segments form a single multi-layered foundation for the Perfect Canvas of Metaphysical Asphalt, upon which the Enigmatic Master frantically tap-dances, disturbing the tangled bonds between the fragile covers over the abyss.\n\nMaster Links:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/mastertriplex\n",
