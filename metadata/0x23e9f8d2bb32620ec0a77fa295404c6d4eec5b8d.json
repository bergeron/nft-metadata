    "description": "This work is a drawing of what I thought when I started NFT.\n\nI had been drawing analog pictures for a while, but a friend of mine who is a partner of Samurai Brothers asked me if I wanted to try NFT.\n I was asked if I wanted to do NFT by a friend who is a partner of Sam Library Brothers, and I have been challenging myself in various ways.\n\nI've always loved drawing, and I'm very grateful to have been given this great opportunity to have people all over the world see the pictures I enjoy drawing.\n\nPeople from all over the world pay money to buy my paintings through ETH.\n\nWe would like to think of ourselves as samurais living in the modern age, and would like to draw various interesting things.\n\nMay this world be a paradise like this painting..",
