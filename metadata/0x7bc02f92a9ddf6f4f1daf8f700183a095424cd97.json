    "description": "I stumbled across this beautiful scene while showing my friend from São Paulo around the southern regions of Norway. We drove up and down the county of Telemark for 10 hours, and was presented with this gorgeous scene that stopped us in our tracks. A slow river with wild salmon jumping right in front of our eyes, with a majestic backdrop. \n\nUndoubtedly one of my all time favorite images that I have ever created, and a perfect representation of the Norwegian countryside, where I grew up.\n\nThis  photograph is an ode to the paintings from the romantic period, and is inspired by \"Brudeferd i Hardanger\" by Hans Gude & Adolph Tidemand.\n\n\n‘Norwegian Romance’ is a limited edition by Ole Haugland\n\nTitle: Norwegian Romance  \nArtist: Ole Haugland (hauglandphoto)  \nEdition: 30 | 30  \nPrice: 0.030Ξ  \nDate: 30.07.2017  \nLocation: Telemark, Norway\n\nLicense : Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
