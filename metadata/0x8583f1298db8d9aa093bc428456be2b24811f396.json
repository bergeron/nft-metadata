    "description": "My work often focuses on visions and hallucinations, yet it is also a reflection (and perhaps a critique) of our own reality. This piece explores the concept of a creation myth - but from the perspective of Wayfinder, a character that can channel and move between alternate realties. This work is an illusion, but one that conjures up some of the most profound questions that we grapple with: How is it that we have come to exist? What came before? What comes after?\n\nWayfinder | 2023",
