    "description": "Cactus flowers are often found growing in the desert. The desert can be an unforgiving environment for much life to grow and thrive. It contains some of the hottest, driest, and loneliest environments that can be found on earth. These flowers symbolize resilience, hope, and a promise that the best is yet to come. No matter how difficult the conditions we find ourselves in, cactus flowers remind us that hope can be found in the midst of those circumstances and that together we can bloom into beautiful possibilities.\n\nArtist: Priya Saihgal\nTwitter: [@PriyaSWTC](https://twitter.com/PriyaSWTC)",
