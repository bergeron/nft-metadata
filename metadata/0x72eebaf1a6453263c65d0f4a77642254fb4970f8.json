    "description": "What can remind a child more than a toy? Toy and child are almost synonymous depending on the situation.\nThis photo was part of an exhibition I held in the 90s in the context of a joint effort to help a family build their house.\nThe place was a slum in the midst of garbage. Not only in a symbolic way, but in a very real way, it represents the reality of many human groups around the world living in extreme poverty and need.\nThere is still solidarity. Rare and less and less sensitive to real human needs. But there are still people who care.\nA burnt toy inside an equally burnt tree cries out for help in several dimensions of our existence as a species.\n--------------------------------\nCanon AE1 program\nCanon 70-210/4 FD\nMicrotek ScanMaker i900\nFilm Ilford HP5\npng - 4658 x 7087 pixels / 34.5MB",
