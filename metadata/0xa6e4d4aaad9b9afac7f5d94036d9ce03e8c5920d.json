    "description": "Captured Work:  \"SEHNSUCHT NACH MASSE\" published in 2019, originally salt printed with 200 edition. \n\nThis over 100 million pixels NFT was platinum printed into physical piece with QR contract address by artist, Yoichi Ochiai. Platinum printed is said to last over 500 years. The printed work will be labelled with the NFT contract address of the digital art. \n\nWhile real works have editions and platinum prints exist in multiple material forms, there is only one NFT digital master plate. Physical platinum-printed works with a long lifespan will be displayed in exhibitions. Each time a work is seen, everyone can confirm the ownership of the digital master plate of the exhibited work.\n\nHerein lies the question of existence. In the future, which will remain longer, the material print or the NFT of digital data? Isn't the difference between digital data and material existence Sehnsucht nach Masse (Longing for the Material World)?\n\nEdition #1/4\n 12360 pix ×  12360   pix\nYoichi Ochiai, 2021",
