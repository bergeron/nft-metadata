    "description": "We Used To Leave Around Here\nA collection of  Composite Photography \n\n1/1 7360 x 4912 Pixels\n\nI am a storyteller using Photography and 3D to create staged images which are alternately playful, often mysterious, thought-provoking, and at times disturbing. \nI compose my models  into digital created sets where they become characters in  my  world. \n\nI consider my work to be voyeuristic. Exposing the women bodies and asking them to perform titillating scenarios. But the women on my images are always in control\n\n",
