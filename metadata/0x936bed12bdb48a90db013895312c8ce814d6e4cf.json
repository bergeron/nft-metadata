    "description": "\"muy bn\" as in very good... Colloquially written. This is a \"wena onda\" (cool vibes) collage from street artworks from Bogotá and Cali, in Colombia.\n\nI started with a Cartesian plane of 4 pictures and from there pasted a couple of stickers here, a couple of graffitis there... And suddenly this 7650x9900 noisy px image came up. And later a whole series both in color and BW.\n\nFrom this one I would feature the mexican mariachi ad, the complot theories and the sticker that says \"sos mi película\" (you are my movie), which I find very deterministc. In general I love the mixture of political, commercial and artistic imprints in the walls which shows a great spectrum of feelings of a community. \n\nTo find in the collage:\n- A devil.\n- A cigarrete with wings\n- Different art disciplines\n- How many cats are there?\n- The meaning of the complot",
