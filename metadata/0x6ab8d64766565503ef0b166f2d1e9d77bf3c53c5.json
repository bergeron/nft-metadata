    "description": "« Easier to ride a wild horse than this »\n\nThe Apocalypse of John was written in the first century, describing something that would be close to our vision of the end of the world. Almost two thousand years later, the end of the world has still not happened.\nTime has changed, and the pain that the four horsemen carried with them has changed too.\nThese NFTs are a new interpretation of John's vision, and show what an apocalyptic destruction or dystopian society could look like in today's world, given all that humanity has created: technology, trash, overconsumption, AI, control… \nThis collection will contain various NFTs and will reveal angels, beasts, and the devil, all related to the myth. The first part of the series to be revealed: the horsemen, however there will be not 4, but in fact 6, bringing with them a new curse.\n",
