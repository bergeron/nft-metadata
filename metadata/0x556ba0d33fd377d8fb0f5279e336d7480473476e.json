    "description": "'You're not talented enough' says the demon in your head. 'You're never going to be as skilled as that leading artist that you admire. You're a failure', adds another voice.\n\nBeating yourself up for not being “good enough” is exhausting. You try so hard to be great, and then you feel bad when you see others succeeding in ways that you can’t seem to achieve. When you feel down about your work or progress, that negative thinking can become a vicious cycle.\n\nAs Charles Bukowski once said: \"Don’t fight your demons. Your demons are here to teach you lessons. Sit down with your demons and have a drink and a chat and learn their names and talk about the burns on their fingers and scratches on their ankles. Some of them are very nice.\"\n\nOur demons keep us honest. They challenge us, motivate us, and help us figure out the next steps. They keep us grounded and humble.",
