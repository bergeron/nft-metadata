    "description": "First piece dropped on new smart contract is this abstract of chives reaching for the light. Representing all of us in this wonderful NFT community during what it truly quite a time to be alive! Or, a chive!\n\nI was inspired to pick this after reading [Medici Miniutes](https://www.mediciminutes.com) about [@XCOPY](https://xcopy.art/) and how they got their start on Tumblr.  I've always loved Tumblr and have posted there for years.\n\nThis post had over 1000 \"notes?\" and was my most popular of all time, so it makes sense to share here as #1 on the new smart contract!!!  \n\n[5-2013](https://2stustudio.tumblr.com/post/51094315745/httpwwwcolbybrownphotographycomyour-favorite)\n\n[8-2015](https://2stustudio.tumblr.com/post/127782159816/and-a-portrait-image-now-abstract-bokehlicious)\n\n[5-2019](https://2stustudio.tumblr.com/post/185063075041/what-a-time-to-be-a-chive-abstract-bokeh)\n\nLicense  \nPrimary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
