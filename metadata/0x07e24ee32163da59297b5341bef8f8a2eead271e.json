    "description": "This photograph was taken when I was in high school and IcelandAir was a cheap way to fly to Europe, at the \"cost\" of a layover in Reykjavik.\n\nThe photograph is of the harbor in Reykjavik. It was taken with an AE-1 film camera and scanned with Kodakâ€™s PhotoCD system. It is basically untouched since then.\n\nIt is the genesis piece of 6529 Raw and my genesis art NFT.\n\nUpon sale, I dedicate all copyright rights to this artwork to the public domain worldwide under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 license.",
