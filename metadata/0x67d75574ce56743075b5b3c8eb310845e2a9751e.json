    "description": "'Doesn't Matter' was written because although you might think it doesn't matter, you never know the impact until you do it. \n\nI wanted to experiment with different production styles and see what I could create. Sat in the studio with an idea and inspiration, this is the result. \n\nThere is something in this track that feels calming to me and is good for the soul. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it. \n\nVocal Credit to: Citizen DJ Project, Joe Smith Collection at the Library of Congress, Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division. \n\nArtwork by Ross.Cracked\nMastering by Rob Small Mastering",
