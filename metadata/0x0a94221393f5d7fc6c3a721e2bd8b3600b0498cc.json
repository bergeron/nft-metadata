    "description": "ABOUT US  \nHomeland 2.0  \nOberlandla stands for a cosmopolitan form of attachment to one's homeland that has grown out of Bavarian roots. We call it Heimattümelei 2.0 - in love with the Bavarian Dahoam, but not completely monogamous. Mia practically live in an open relationship with their homeland. Our understanding of love of home: it is a foundation and no border!\n\nThat's why there's a skull and crossbones in the logo: a skull doesn't tell you whether it's Mandal or woman, gwampad or boan, black or white, Bayer or Preiss, homo or straight, spiked or poor, stupid or bad.\n\nWhere 's Hoamatgfui cuddles with open-mindedness and tradition drinks with the subculture a Hoibe.  \nWhere tradition mixes with free spirit and your roots grow beyond the horizon.\n\nThere san mia. OBERLANDLA®\n\nTwo people from Munich who moved from the city to the country years ago.  \nCreative smashers and obsessed t-shirt beautifiers.  \nInspired by good design from all over the world and by the Bavarian dialect.",
