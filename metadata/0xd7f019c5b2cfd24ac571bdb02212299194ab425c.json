For this NFT I changed it making it a unique artwork for a collector to enjoy.\n\nAs with all my NFT's making prints and even selling those prints is allowed for the owner of the NFT making it possible to earn back the investment and having more people enjoy the artwork. The right to print passes along to the new owner when the NFT is resold.",
