    "description": "Twitter Blue has become the new Pandora. Tons of Avatars running around trying to find their place in the metaverse. Once you have linked/subscribed, you are fully apart of the tribe. Don't Change anything once your set up your Avatar PFP and username. Doing so, you will lose your Twitter Blue Checkmark that you are paying hard earned money on. Now...other people won't see you like they do other Avatars. You will become blind them. So just a reminder. Once your create your Avatar on Twitter Blue, never changed it.",
