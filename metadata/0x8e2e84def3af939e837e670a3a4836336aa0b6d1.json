    "description": "Drosera or more commonly known as Sundew may be my most photographed subject ever. I have published three series of these alien looking plants and this one belongs to first of the image series which is called “Drosera”.\n\nI’m intrigued mostly about their other worldly appearance and vivid colors, but these are also carnivorous plants which makes it even more interesting. \n\nThis particular specimen was photographed in the summer of 2014 at a local swamp in Southern Ostrobothnia, Western Finland.",
