    "description": "The collection « The wall » is my logbook.\nThursday May 5, 2022 ///\nAs a passenger in the 21st Century I wanted to show my experience with the evolution of AI in art world. From the first humans who left their trace on the walls all the way to those who promote their work on social network, millions of years have passed since then. The evolution of AI is so rapid that I can see its (hi)story being written right in front of my eyes in a matter of a couple of months.\nI don’t yet know how this logbook will evolve, as I don’t know just how far AI will bring us. Only the future can tell ///\nFrom left to right : 01 original footage (March 2021) / 02 Rissc hits hard! (July 2021) / 03 Neon girl (August 2021) / 04 Rissc hits again! (March 2022) /// Dancer: Rissc / Music : Rim Laurens /// 4K (3840x2160) 25p, 11sec. The collector will get the original video file in 4K.\n",
