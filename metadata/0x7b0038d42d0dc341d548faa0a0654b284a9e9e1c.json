    "description": "Narada, the young artist from Berlin, was born in 2015 and is already one of the youngest NFT artists in the world. He developed an early passion for the world of art and has particularly focused on the art of linocut printing. Inspired by a visit to the studio of a renowned artist, he has been working with this technique with passion and dedication. In 2022, Narada released his first NFTs, including original works of art, on the Tezos blockchain, which sold out immediately. Now he is proud to present his first NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, which is based, among other things, on the traditional technique of linocut printing. This artwork is part of a limited edition of a total of 5 different prints and it is Narada's favorite picture. Each print is unique and showcases the unmistakable handwriting of the young artist whose talent and passion for art is undeniable. This special artwork is now available in a limited edition of only 500 pieces as an NFT, offering collectors and art lovers the opportunity to own an authentic and unique work of art by one of the youngest NFT artists in the world.",
