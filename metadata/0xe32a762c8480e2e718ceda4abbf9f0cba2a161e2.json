    "description": "'The nest' is part of a series of landscape-metaphors on the transformations of matter. The folds of time and space are displaced and reveal glimpses of other dimensions which virtually manifest in the reality of the physical world. Blending between minimal metaphysical landscape and complex otherworldly sheer apparitions, these artworks transport the viewer to a contemplative and meditative state, where deep philosophical background and visual mesmerism are intertwined. 'The nest' is AI-generated and procedurally animated.",
