    "description": "\nLike an Echo.\nEverything we do in our life reverberates towards infinity and immensity.\n\nWhen we leave, our footprint remains somehow, transmutes.\nBut it is still part of this crazy Universe.\n\nEvery action, every gesture we make, every moment we are part of, builds who we are.\nThe enlargement of the Spirit does not rest.\n\nWe ultimately have to let go of so many things in life that the only thing left for us to do is trust.\n\nFaith calls us to the surrender of the human, reminds us that more than a Body and more than a Soul, there is a Spirit that sustains us and that there are many things that from the body we cannot understand but always happen to us for something greater. \n\nIt is life.\n' I sail on the water and trust that my power of action is limited, although necessary. In that limitation, I take responsibility for each small gesture that makes up something greater of which it was a part '.\n\nOnly then will you reverberate in infinity in the purest way possible.\n\n ∞♡",
