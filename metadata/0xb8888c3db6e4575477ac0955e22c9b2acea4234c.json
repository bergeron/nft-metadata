    "description": "This song is a single off of our debut album dropping this year. \n\nWe wanted to reference the structure and feeling of our biggest song ever \"Phases.\" Once we started to get into it, the song took on a life of its own making it one of our favorite songs ever created. \n\nThe song is about not being ready to go on in life without someone you consider a significant other. Life feels complete when you are around this person and for some reason this person isn't even considering you. \n\nIt's a love song but it feels bigger than that. ",
