    "description": "A love letter to the mountains who keep me: \n\nTucked away, in one of your many contours, I admire you. I live for you and everything you offer me, and in return I acknowledge the power you have to take everything that I am. \n\nI’ve guessed at your intention, and will continue to search for your meaning in this world, as I continue to search for my own. \n\nYou Inspire me, impossibly, endlessly. You’ve taught me respect, awareness, love. Allow me to imagine, how we would be, if I were less afraid.\n\nThe mountains are my sanctuary.",
