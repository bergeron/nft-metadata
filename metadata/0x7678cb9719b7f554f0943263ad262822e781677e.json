    "description": "‘Prophetic Dreams’, from ‘Metamorphosis. Black’ series by Maria Pleshkova.\n\n//\n\nInk drops into the water. Transparency becomes black. Black absorbs light and heat. Black hides everything.\n\nMy Microcosm is changing in parallel with a dramatically changing Macrocosm. I need to adapt to reality, but instead, I’m trying to escape. Making art is a form of escapism. Through photography, I create my own universe. I transform my anxiety, fears, obsessions, and shame into pictures.\n\nThe older I get, the faster time seems to go. The fear of death is the fear of the unknown. It’s impossible to imagine non-existence.\n\nI make self-portraits because I am so often alone, and because I am the person I know best. Creation is the opposite of death, and each self-portrait is the answer to the question ‘Am I still alive?’\n\n//\n\nSelf-portrait. Digital photograph, manipulated. 5000x5000px. 2016. Edition 1/1.\n",
