    "description": "Change of Seasons: Spring NFT has been issued as a unique edition. \n\nPhoto: 5271 x 3473 px\n\nSpring is an epitome of birth, a new beginning. It reminds of freshness and youth. \n\nEverything speaks of nature full of life: blooming trees, green grass, wet soil welcoming all kinds of newly-born creatures crawling under your feet, white virgin clouds and deep blue sky. \n\nThis bare landscape has so much to it. It just pleads with you to visit and stay for a while, observing the quiet beauty of the prairies. \n",
