    "description": "Each step through the darkness upward and toward the zenith a challenge, a repetitive requisite, a mantra. Eventually cresting the top of the sculpture and emerging into the light, riding on the energy of enlightenment, we feel the cathartic flow of the freefall - a freefall into a renewed state of calmness, back to the realities from which we came. Only now with a changed state of mind, a new awareness, an altered perspective.\n\n'Black Slide Mantra' by Isamu Noguchi. Sapporo, Japan.",
