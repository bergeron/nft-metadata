    "description": "Thursday, February 24 2022 Russia launched an unprecedented invasion of peaceful Ukraine. People were woke up by missile explosions all over the country. The Genocide of Nation Began. Russian military kills women, kids, bombs civil houses and hospitals. PUTIN's Imperial Desires MUST BE STOPPED. We are talking about peace in Europe and whole world. Appreciate all countries that support Ukraine in this unfair war. \nThis Artwork is a collage from recent photos taken across the country, consequences of \"the Russian Peace\" that they brought. \nUkraine is still standing, not surrender. \nFunds from selling this NFT will go to help Ukrainin people. \nSlava Ukraine!",
