    "description": "Sarah Trouche is a French visual artist who uses performance, photography, video and sculpture as her means of expression. She draws inspiration from encounters she makes during her travels and uses her body as a tool to convey art and political message. \nDuring the « non fungible body »festival 2022 in Linz, the artist did the « Global Warming Performance » on the rooftop of the museum in front of the audience. \nThe performance protocol was for her to masturbate in the middle of ice blocks until she reached an orgasm. \nThe photography of the performance is made with ultra violet filter. \nThe performance was a political eco feminist statement in relation with the collection of the Linz Museum ; the artists Egon Schiele and Valie Export. \n#sarahtrouche #valieexport  \n#egonschiele #orgasm  \n#performanceart #bodyart",
