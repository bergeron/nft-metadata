    "description": "Rocket Dog Runs for Mayor\nSometimes I have trouble getting started with a song, so Iâ€™ll start with a song title. Once I come up with a title, I like to imagine what the finished song might sound like and create a story about what inspired it. \nI came up with the title of this one and then quickly started writing lyrics and a keyboard melody. Once I get started with that, I can clear my mind and just let everything else fall into place.",
