    "description": "\"Moving\" is the first collaboration of many between Omotayo and Arghtee. Both returning back to London after first meeting at Art Basel Week Miami, the pair met up at ZEROREST Studios in Hackney at the end of December 2022 and the magic started to happen with \"Moving\" being the first finalised piece of work between the pair. \n\nOmotayo has since officially joined the Ice Starz as \"Snow Mama\" and the two have been knocking out collaborative effort after collaborative effort, so expect to see a lot more music involving both creative energies soon!",
