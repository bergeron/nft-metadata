    "description": "That day, the sun was hiding behind the little piece of black cloud. The moon was between the earth and the sun, and there occured the solar eclipse. The birds' chirping was clearly heard. The thick, cold fog had limited the eyesight. I looked at the sky. I was sitting there. I try to repeat my body form. It's difficult! I can't! Impossible! Can you hear the birds'chirping too?\n\n\n∎Technical Specifications: \n⦁Technique: Photography, Videography\n⦁Style: Video Art - loop\n⦁Size: 2K\n",
