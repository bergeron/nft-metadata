    "description": "amnesia\n/amˈniːzɪə/\n\nnoun\na partial or total loss of memory.\n\nA fashion narrative that uses the idea of being imprisoned in a dream to convey the feeling of being enclosed in a cocoon. \n\nI hold fast in my conviction and hope, yet I can't say that I have very distinct memories of you. I feel entrapped and really cold because the gold chains aren't actually gold. We might have shared few good memories together, but I'm a slave with memories as brittle as a feather.\n\n\n",
