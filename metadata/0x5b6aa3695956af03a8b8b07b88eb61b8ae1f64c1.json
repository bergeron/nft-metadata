    "description": "Every year since 1998 I've tried to render something festive for the holidays.  Sometimes it's something totally new, sometimes I adapt an existing scene.   \n\nThe theme is usually light in the darkness though and that was true in 2000 when I used the same Lightwave particle system that I've employed for \"Pyre\" to bedeck a tree with my first attempt at multi-colored lights.  It was very popular at the time.\n\nSomeone reposted this render in a gallery somewhere and it went viral.   It's appeared on tv and various websites/social media pages numerous times and I never sought compensation.   I would rather more folks enjoy my work during the holidays.    Still, it would be nice to get a credit from time to time and that's never really happened.\n\nMinting it on the blockchain will finally solidify for all time who created this particular Christmas render.   \n\nHo ho ho!",
