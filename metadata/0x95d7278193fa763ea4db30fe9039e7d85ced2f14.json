    "description": "This is a 1/1 limited piece created by Oliver Vanice in December, 2021. \n\nThis piece is a marriage between traditional photography, digital art, and “neurography” — the use of artificial intelligence in a true artisan way — to create a unique, one-of-a-kind artwork.\n\nThis NFT invites the audience to explore where the neurographer welded the photo and the digital art together, and to find the story hidden behind them. This piece represents the meeting point of skill, craft, and technology.\n\nBuying this piece would support the artist to continue to create, to experiment, to push the boundaries of “neural art”, and it would be an investment in the career of fresh talent coming up in the fine art world.",
