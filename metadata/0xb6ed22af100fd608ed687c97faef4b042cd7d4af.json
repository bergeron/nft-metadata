    "description": "So we like text projects this week, do we? Well here's some generative profanity for you, dipshit. FUCK LOOT is a text based NFT project where 50% of the mint profits and 100% of the royalties go to a community wallet that holders will be able to draw from based on their FUCK LOOT holdings. Balances are tied to each NFT and will be easily verifiable via our website when the payout app is launched. Get fucked.",
