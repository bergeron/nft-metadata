    "description": "This art is the result of my deep concern for our planet: people, nature, energy. Everything that regularly happens on Earth because of people is clearly not what our beautiful world was created for. But despite all the pain I feel, I still have hope in my heart, as in the eyes of the Ð¡reator. Yes, it is sad and painful to look at what is happening, but I believe and hope that our planet will live in peace and harmony. I believe. I am full of hope.\n1/1 digital art 3000*4000 300dpi",
