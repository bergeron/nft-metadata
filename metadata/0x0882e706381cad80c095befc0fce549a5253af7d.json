    "description": "A few weeks ago I got a letter from the Department of Human Health. My daughter who is 1 years old has lead poisoning. I've been working on this piece of art since then. She has 7u of lead in her blood. Myself & my significant other have around 1u in our blood. This piece of art is a tribute to her strength. We can not stay at our apartment. Right now we are staying with family. It takes around 3 months for lead to exit a child's system unless it gets into their bones & bone marrow. This piece was a form of therapy for me & also to spread awareness about this horrific blood disease. I will write a thread so NFT collectors with kids know more about it & how to limit exposure to it. Google the symptoms & what can happen to a child after exposure. I cannot write them. There are a TON of subluminal textures, & art styles I used in this.",
