    "description": "The Croc, who lives in the Underwater World and serves under the God of the Sea, leads a large army to protect the Aqua Kingdom. He is known to be a hot-tempered person who always speaks his mind but is also extremely loyal. However, he does not agree with the pacifist policy of the God of the Sea because he considers this as a hurdle to the Kingdomâ€™s development. His hot temper and simple thinking make him an easy target of the dark forces.",
