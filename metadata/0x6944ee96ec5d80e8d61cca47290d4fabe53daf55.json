    "name": "Flamingo in Portrait",
    "description": "Iâ€™ve always thought that flamingos are one of the most interesting looking birds. Long stalks for legs and elongated necks, with an explosion of bright color ranging from pinks to reds for feathers. This photograph reminds me a bit of a Rembrandt painting, which was a result of both the pose the flamingo was in, as well as the light. ",
