    "BRAIN FOG - HOW I LOST EVERYTHING AND FOUND A CURE": "TL;DR Brain fog can be cured by combining small regular doses of psilocybin with a myelin regenerative diet for a while. This journal is about my personal experience and research that prompted that conclusion. **Obligatory** I am not a doctor. I do not recommend that you do anything mentioned herein. This is a story about my personal experience. It is not a medical recommendation.   2.22.22 In December 2020 I moved from NY to CA to live with my mom and my sister. Lockdowns had made the city a dismal place and it felt like an important time to be home. My parents were on the tail end of a divorce and my mom had only just opened her first business. I thought whatever expenses I had in NY would be much better used for the family. I wanted to help in any way I could and it seemed like a solid plan until I ran into complications with my health.  Shorty after settling in, I experienced a sudden and unwarranted rapid decline in my cognitive ability. Over just a few months my entire life changed. Up until that point I had been a talented photographer working at the top of my industry. Exceptional physical and mental health were an endowment I had enjoyed and safe-guarded my entire life. What I am about to describe happened out of the blue and is unlike anything I have ever experienced.  From one day to the next, it was impossible to get out of bed in the morning. My body became really inflamed. I had dark circles under my eyes that lasted for months. Normal daily activities were exhausting. For the first time in my life I dreaded interacting with people. I couldn’t look them in the eyes. Articulating a conversation was extremely difficult. Constantly I found myself tongue tied. The sheer thought of trying to express myself through art or go after any of my business goals brought on anxiety. My outlook turned from optimism to fear and hopelessness seemingly overnight. The voice in my head was sad, yet there was nothing in my life to actually be sad about. Although I missed my girlfriend and my friends from NY, it was noting to warrant dysfunction. My diet and lifestyle had even improved since moving to CA. I wondered if I was depressed, I had always heard about depression but never experienced it. Maybe this was it. At some point I realized how completely cut off from myself I was. Almost every personal skill and ability that I was proud of and that defined my character was changed in some way or just gone completely. I couldn’t do anything with the precision, timeliness, and thoroughness that I could do it before. I was numb. To the point where music didn’t even sound as good. For the first time ever I had real suicidal thoughts. It was hard to control my temper. I was emotionless to those around me. And to nature. I lost vocabulary. I couldn’t do math as well. My memory was so bad I would lose grasp of what I was reading halfway through a paragraph. I was so ashamed that I did everything in my power to try and hide it. I didn’t want anyone to think something was wrong with me. I just wanted myself back. My real self. Not even money could motivate me to talk to people at a certain point. I stopped taking calls with my clients so that they wouldn’t hear how much I was struggling. Instead I would write emails, but those took hours. It was even hard to type. I would stumble over keys where before I could type faster than I could think. I was working on a website to sell my photographs but I completely lost objective. The brain fog was too much. And not only with my website, but with everything. I found it impossible to think clearly or strategize whatsoever. Even the simplest of photography would exhaust me and was overwhelming. A skill that was practically muscle memory because I had been doing it for over a decade. I stopped booking clients all together. I lost my income.  At this point my stress become visible. I was a menace to be around. My relationships with my family deteriorated. Then my friends and my clients. It was the hardest for my mother and and 14 year old sister as I was closest to them, living with them. They were filled with terror and concern. I was not the same person that they had known their whole lives and I had no explanation. Nor was I ready to admit how damaged I was. I was still completely in denial of all of it. It was so difficult to be around me that my sister went to live with my dad, and my mom asked me to leave. Who could blame them. Who wants to hang around someone who’s been stripped of all their life forces, let alone live with them. At that point I wanted to just die. I had lost everything. Betrayed everyone that mattered to me most. It was the worst moment of my life.  I never ever imagined myself  being in this place but I actually told myself “go do some drugs.” Believe it or not, this is actually the part where things kind of turn around. I did mushrooms first. I had done them before, so I figured I might as well start natural and work my way up. Im glad I did. After eating them a couple of times, I began to feel a little different. Not the trippy psychedelic different that you’re probably imagining, but different like it was easier to get out of bed in the morning and I felt less tired during the day. Even days after I had eaten them. I also lost the desire to do anything harmful to myself. Whether it was substances or eating bad food, I wasn’t interested, I cared about myself. It was nice, but the rest of my life was still a mess so I didn’t think much of it. I did mushrooms a couple more times and then things got a little interesting. In the weeks that followed, it was easier to talk to people. I didn’t stumble over my words and my thoughts were clearer. I didn’t avoid coffee shops or dread going to get groceries. I actually had the courage to strike up conversations with ladies who I was attracted too.  Nice too. I was beginning to wonder if the mushrooms had anything to do with it. I did them a couple more times and sure enough I noticed all the same things. It surprised me how the relief would last for weeks. Each time I did them it took the brain fog longer and longer to crawl back and I felt like I was regaining a grip on myself. Of course I wanted the brain fog to go away and never come back so I decided to eat mushrooms every week for a couple of months. Here is what happened: The brain fog never came back. I could look people in the eye again. I could articulate conversations. My vocabulary improved. I could do mental math again. My inflammation went away. The dark circles under my eyes went away. I could focus for hours tirelessly. I had no anxiety even when faced with difficult situations. It was effortless to strategize around business and approach photography creatively. I could even learn new things. I reached out to my family and wasn’t afraid to do it. I felt love in my heart when I thought about people. I cried for the first time in a year. I had sparkles of joy, tons of energy….  and music sounded fuckin’ BOMB again, and even though I stopped eating mushrooms consistently the feelings are lasting. I am BACK. Reconnected with my soul is pretty much the best way to describe it.   At the time that I was beginning to feel the first positive effects of mushrooms, I reconnected with a dear friend of mine from high school. He had suffered a severe concussion some years before and discussed with me his recovery. It was like a marathon for him and unfortunately still is in ways. He tried dozens of things, but was particularly excited to tell me about how mushrooms were helping him. Shockingly, many of the symptoms he was relieved of I was also relieved of. To this day I find it eerie. How could I be experiencing so many concussion-like symptoms without ever having a concussion? There are too many parallels for me to ignore. Especially when looking at the physical effects of mushrooms. Sure, they are known for visuals mostly. Probably less known is that they stimulate neuroplasticity in adults. Children’s brains have natural neuroplasticity. (Which is by definition the brain’s capacity to grow and evolve from life experiences. It is the brains ability to create new neurons and build new networks.) This is why children learn so easily. Maybe in the case of my friend and I, we were rebuilding damaged networks? It was clear to me that I was healing from the more subtle, physical effects of mushrooms. I never even took enough to have visuals, and it’s not like they gave me superpowers or anything. The abilities that came back were abilities that I had always naturally possessed. The same abilities that gave me talent, personality, and character before I was cut off from myself. How on earth was my brain damaged in the first place though? I was 26 and I certainly hadn’t lived a life of alcoholism or drug abuse. Let alone had a concussion.  Perhaps the most haunting thing about what happened to me is that maybe it was physical. Unlike how depressions are rumored to be, nothing sends me back. There is no relapse. I don’t feel fragile. This has been really put to the test too. Dealing with the trauma and aftermath of everything has subjected me to the most severe mental strain imaginable. I’ve nearly been homeless. My relationships with my family remain in ruins. Im in the worst financial place I’ve ever been. I’ve been sad. I’ve been stressed. Despite this, the brain fog doesn't return. I feel physically well and fit. Clear headed. Completely capable of healing my relationships and my finances. Im not scared to do things like share this story. I feel like Im in charge of myself. I find joy in things. I can look people in the eye. I could not say the same for myself before healing. Even though I had far less stressful circumstances to deal with. In hindsight, the brain fog seems so bizarre and artificial. Both Covid and the Covid vaccines are rumored to have side effects of “brain fog.” Although I’ve never tested positive for Covid or had the vaccine, I wonder if I was affected in one way or another. It’s still a mystery to me.         6.9.22 I thought my story would be over now but I had another run-in with brain fog. This one brings some answers and luckily was nowhere near as long or as severe as the first time. I was traveling in May 2022 and caught a cold from a flight I was on. Im just gonna call it a cold because I didn’t actually test positive for Covid. I have my suspicions of course. The whole experience was strange from the start. Before I had any respiratory symptoms or knew I had a cold, my mental health dropped off a cliff for no apparent reason. I felt depressed, lethargic, and anxious. A couple days later I got a sore throat, runny nose, and a cough. Those symptoms were gone within a week and nothing to write home about. What persisted weeks later was fatigue. Dark circles under my eyes. Inflammation in my body. Difficulty getting up in the morning. Difficulty focusing. WTF. Never in my life has a cold led to cognitive disfunction or lasting symptoms like this. The symptoms are gone now but it seems so unusual and sinister. I can’t speculate if the sicknesses going around right now are manufactured or not, but if they are; I am living proof of crimes against humanity.  In my research about brain-fog I have come across multitudes of articles mentioning “long covid.” Which I suspect this is. I’ll link a few here so you can see what I mean. In a Wired Interview: (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.wired.com/story/the-secrets-of-covid-brain-fog-are-starting-to-lift/ ] about “long-covid,” Allison Guy describes symptoms that were shockingly similar to mine. And this article from NPR (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.npr.org/2022/07/31/1114375163/long-covid-longhaulers-disability-labor-ada ] attempts to describe the effects this can have on ones life. Both articles are rather depressing but that’s not the only thing they have in common. They both also fail to mention a cure.  The NPR article goes as far as referencing guidance from the DHHS (Copy paste the link) https://www.ada.gov/long_covid_joint_guidance.pdfthat states “long-covid” is a disability. Followed up with a long COVID guide for employers (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.npr.org/2022/07/31/1114375163/long-covid-longhaulers-disability-labor-ada ] and a suggestion that people who experience symptoms should apply for Disability aid from Social Security. (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/disability/  ] The tone was to accept this new reality and compensate rather than heal. Sure, I’ll collect the Social Security, Im entitled to it. But accept this mysterious condition with no cure? Ummmm, no. Absolutely not. TF? (We do not have to accept that horse shit wrapped in cat shit. I am high functioning and so are you. It’s our responsibility to remember how amazing we are and find ways to perform how we always have. There’s no telling what will happen if we do not.)  The good news is I’ve fought this and I’ve won. I’ve had the deep dive into healing so Im gonna share with you the things that helped me most. I learned that microdosing psilocybin and having a consistent diet that promotes Myelin regeneration (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.optimallivingdynamics.com/blog/25-proven-ways-to-promote-the-regeneration-of-myelin ] works wonders. It actually eliminates these effects all together eventually. Naturally. To the point where you don’t need psilocybin at all. I explored a myelin regenerative diet after discovering this study called: Mild respiratory COVID can cause multi-lineage neural cell and myelin dysregulation. (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00713-9 ] The study was done on mice who survived Covid. Yes, unfortunately in a lab. The scientists found that myelin dysregulation was common in the Covid survivors and lead to “lingering neurological symptoms that resemble cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment.” Wow, okay, cool. Myelin is the stuff surrounding your nerve cell axons that facilitates electrical impulse conduction in your brain. In other words how your brain fires. Although the study goes pretty in depth into how Covid destroys this important stuff, it fails to mention a cure. Eating foods that regenerate myelin was a solution of my own and luckily I found this helpful article: (Copy paste the link) [ https://www.optimallivingdynamics.com/blog/25-proven-ways-to-promote-the-regeneration-of-myelin ] that got me started.  Perhaps I should also mention that the diet worked best when my ingredients were sourced as naturally as possible and ideally locally. Eating any processed foods or anything non organic made me feel even worse. Pretty much anything from the normal food supply chain made me feel worse. I’ve had to be selective with restaurants and I’ve had the most success eating simple natural foods. Steak and eggs and veggies are a good place to start. My story is rather personal but Im choosing to share it anyway. If I have the opportunity to help just one person it was worth writing. Im not sure how many others are experiencing this so please share it however you can. I hope this reaches those in need and also some experts who can help answer my questions.  Thanks for reading!
