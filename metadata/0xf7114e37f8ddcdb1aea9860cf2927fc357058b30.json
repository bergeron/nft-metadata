    "description": "Something I've always loved about being a photographer is learning new ways on how to tell a story. In 2018, I started to mess with developing my own film, and this was the very first roll. I didn't know at the time of development but something was going on with the chem and the film was sticking together. It ended up creating this acid like look. I have a couple other rolls that are like this, but this is a good start to what would become my film photo journey. ",
