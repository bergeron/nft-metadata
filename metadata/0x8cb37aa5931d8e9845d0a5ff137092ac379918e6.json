    "description": "\"Gamer's Nest\" is an esoteric mélange of neon chaos and digital serenity. Fractals of luminous anime creatures traverse labyrinthine circuitry, creating a cosmic carnival of pixels.\n\nIn the epicentre, sits the gamer, a tranquil deity amidst the chaos. Their throne, an organic-electronic fusion, suggests a nest — a sanctuary within the sprawling electronic Eden. \"Gamer's Nest\" presents a curious paradox: a reality that's both our escapist fantasy and electronic entrapment.\n\nArtwork information:\nDigital animation (mp4)\nFrame Rate: 30 fps\nduration: 33 sec\nresolution: 720p",
