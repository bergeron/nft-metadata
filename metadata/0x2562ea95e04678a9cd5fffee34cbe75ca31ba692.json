    "description": "The concept of this NFT is to connect the past and the present as I mainly do in most of my art creations. \n\nAn ARTEM coin in high-speed motion explodes a classical statue. It's a meaningful representation of the \"Virtuality\" of the blockchain smashing the \"Reality\" of the past tangible world.\n\n It's also a dialog in between the past & the future that arise the question of the conservation of the Historical aspects of Humanbeing. \n",
