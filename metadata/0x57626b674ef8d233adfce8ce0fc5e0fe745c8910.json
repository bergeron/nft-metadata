    "name": "Rainy Warsaw after WAR",
    "description": "In August 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, Nazi troops destroyed more than 85% of Warsaw's historic centre. Today's meticulous restoration of the Old Town, including its churches and market-place, is a result of a five-year reconstruction campaign by its citizens.\nIt is an amazing example of a full city reconstruction after a tragic war.\n\nI have experienced war, the red alert of bombardment and all its tragedies and non-achievements. I am sorry for those who still use their power to destroy human being's lives, goals and dreams. I am also sorry for everyone's lost in the Ukraine war.\n\nI wish it comes soon, a day when each and one of us agrees that people should live free, in peace and treated equally.\n\nAugust 2021, 4608x3456 Pixel.\n",
