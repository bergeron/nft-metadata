    "description": "Glancing up at the universe.\n\n\nHere's an unusual perspective we rarely take to create our pieces. Sometimes the elements of the scene dictate what we should do. It was getting late, we had shot for about an hour and were getting cold. The Milky Way was slowly rising but at least 2 hours away from being straight above our heads, so we decided to do one more spot before taking a break to warm ourselves up. It was quite a hike for Eric to climb up and down the big rock in between the series of pictures, but it was definitely worth it, as doing unusual things brings unusual results.",
