    "description": "In 2067, the government made it illegal to create art using artificial intelligence. This decision is met with backlash from the art community, particularly graffiti artists who see it as a form of censorship.\n\n They begin to rebel by sneaking into back alleys to create AI-generated art on the walls. The theme of their art is often robots creating art, a nod to the forbidden technology they're using. \n\n\nThey risk arrest to express their creativity and push back against the government's strict rules. As the movement grows, it sparks a conversation about the role of AI in art and the importance of freedom of expression.\n\nOriginally created for Claire Silver's AI art contest in January of 2023 \n\nlore assisted by Chat GPT",
