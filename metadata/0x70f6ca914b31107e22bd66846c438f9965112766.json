    "description": "In downtown Minneapolis there used to be an older gentlemen that would play saxophone on Nicollet Avenue. He is blind and just loved to play and listen to the sounds of the saxophone bounce off the walls of the city skyscrapers. I caught him playing one night while photographing downtown and couldn't miss the opportunity to memorialize him forever.\n\nEdition: 1 of 1\n\nArtist: Tyler James\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
