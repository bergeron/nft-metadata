    "description": "This is a token of my gratitude to everyone who has supported me and my work. It is hard to verbally express how much it means to me so I figured this may do the trick. \n\nEgo is a tricky thing to balance. Everyone has it. It is built up to protect you from harm of all kinds. A negative side effect of this is that you can get in your way sometimes. Because of this I think it is very healthy to cleanse the ego and accept the consequences of your actions. Consequences don't have to be correlated to something negative. They are just the effect to our cause. Just make sure your cause is good. \n\nAnd once again, thank you. \n\nLove  \n-LETHAL",
