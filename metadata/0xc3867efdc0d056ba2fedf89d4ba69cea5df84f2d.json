    "description": "On the streets of Kolkata, time stands still. It’s a city untouched by the heavy hand of globalisation. Tradition thrives on every street corner. Nowhere is this more evident than the bustle and chaos of Malik Ghat Flower Market. Malik Ghat lies in the shadow of the Howrah Bridge, on the banks of the Hoogly River, a tributary of the sacred Ganges. It’s one of the largest wholesale flower market on the planet. \n\nTwo thousand sellers gather daily to peddle their blooms. The streets are lined with bowls and knots of flowers. Every colour, species and fragrance fused together, overwhelming the senses. The sellers take pride in protecting and maintaining every stem. They wander through the market, carefully avoiding collision while draped in hundreds of flowers. Their silhouettes mutated into a shape shifting mass of foliage. Bringing a soft sensuality to these hardworking, stoic men.\n \nEdition 1/1 by Ken Hermann",
