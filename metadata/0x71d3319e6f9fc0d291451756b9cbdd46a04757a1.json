    "description": "‘Peru, a journey for my father’ is a series of images taken on a trek in the Andes Mountains of Peru in 2005 after the loss of my father. The work illustrates a longing for connection and a search for structure during a period of grief and uncertainty in my life. Finding solace in the landscape and connecting with strangers through my lens offered a cathartic experience I feel played a part in my acceptance of loss.\n\n25% of profits go to the Multiple Myeloma charity www.myeloma.org.uk",
