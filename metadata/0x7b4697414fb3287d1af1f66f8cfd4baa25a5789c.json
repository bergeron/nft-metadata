    "description": "Cole lives in the highest house in the forest. Like every other night, he comes to the window to watch the outside and sees Anna return from a night walk in the woods with her dog. Sima takes care of her stubborn child playing among the sharp corner houses while Yani is reading a book in the yard. His eyes fall on Fred, his other neighbor, who is kissing his lover. Suddenly, he realizes that his cat is gone to the house's roof and is staring at something. In the bright moonlight, Cole could see what his cat is staring at. They were a boy and a girl dancing on the moon.",
