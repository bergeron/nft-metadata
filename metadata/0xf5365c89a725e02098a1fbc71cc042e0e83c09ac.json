    "description": "Before the pandemics, I was an aspiring street photographer. Then the quarantines struck and I was homebound as with the rest of the world. As hard as it was for me, there was an upside. I started to lookup more and discovered a whole different life up there. I fell in love with observing the clouds, the different colors, the birds flying freely... I found solace in painting the skies.\n\nNow, whenever life gives me a hard time, I look up and capture the sheer beauty the skies offer us. That's why I picked this piece as my first ever NFT, hoping that you find the same peace and calm that I found in it.",
