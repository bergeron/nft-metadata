    "description": "Lunares Somnium: ‘Moon Dream’ is a collaboration with KEISER CLARK. The Board like the fashion collection also named Lunares Somnium, fuses the effortless cool of California’s surf community with the electric-flare of ‘80s and ‘90s rave culture reimagined in an out of this world ocean-scape. Pulling from the Dusk Blue, Navy, and Black hues and the Interstellar theme running throughout the collection, the Board takes us on a journey into the horizon.\n\nInspired by his Original BitBoard collection, Calvyn's LUNARES SOMNIUM is the second design in the evolution of the digital surfboard art style.\n\nWhere the BitBoard collection is more focused on the surfboard, this next development is focused not only on the surfboard but the world & landscapes in which it inhabits too.\n\nWhilst majority of the BitBoard collection has multiple editions, Fleur Ex Machina and it's successors will all be 1/1.",
