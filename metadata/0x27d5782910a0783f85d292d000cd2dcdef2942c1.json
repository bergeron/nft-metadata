    "description": "This image taken of a tree on my daily walk.  It is the product of 4 separate shots and using the process of focus stacking to bring out all the details.  This contains multiple types of Lichen in a beautiful tiny ecosystem.  I have named is Island because the center element reminds me of an island between two rivers.  I truly hope you enjoy and can appreciate the small and beautiful things that are everywhere if you take a moment to look.",
