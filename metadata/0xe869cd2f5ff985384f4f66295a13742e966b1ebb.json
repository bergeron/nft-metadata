    "description": "When creating, stagnation comes in the form of blocking our intuition, and attaching our expectations to the analytical side of our minds. To break that cycle, we only need to sit still, and let the waters of imagination guide our spirit and body. With no Judgement, we'll see ourselves, and our creations as they truly are. As manifestations of everything that is.",
