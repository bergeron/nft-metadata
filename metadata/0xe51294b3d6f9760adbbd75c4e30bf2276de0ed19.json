    "description": "This NFT has been awarded for success in a Phantom Galaxies Planet Auction, and entitles its owner to a Planet Genesis Mintpass.\n\nThe owner will be able to transfer this NFT to an official Phantom Galaxies wallet (see below for Wallet ID) - once this transaction has taken place, a Planet Genesis Mintpass from the Planet collection will be sent to the ownerâ€™s wallet.\n\nIn the vastness of space, the great monoliths of Planets blot out the stars. Each Planet is unique, ripe with opportunity. Every holder will be able to rule and build as they wish, and reap the benefits. Auction victors have staked their claim on a piece of the galaxy, and will be justly rewarded.\n\n\n\nPhantom Galaxies Wallet ID: 0xC2f37E0C46C82A4bde20c3eC803202D61f94C941",
