    "description": "place: Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow\n\nsong: Local Natives - Ceilings (Kasbo Remix)\n\nThese pretty golden glass pieces have always captivated me. Every bike ride would eventually end with me standing under the building mesmerized by the beauty of its roof structure. But it's not always that bright and shiny. It's only at the first light of the sun that you can truly admire the architectural beauty of the building, as the first rays mildly touch the glass, blinking at you left and right.\n\nHowever, most of the people don't have the access to such beauty, forced to watch from the ground and not being able to experience the full spectrum of emotions from how amazing this place is. I was one of these people too. Until that morning.",
