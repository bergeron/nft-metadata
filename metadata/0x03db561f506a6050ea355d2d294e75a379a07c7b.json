    "description": "Free Love is my attempt to (sonically) open up the hearts of the world. it’s a “love bomb” if you will.  we aren’t just captives to the power that be.  Art, especially music, is extremely powerful and should be treated as so. \n\nThe song has little to do with the original meaning of the phrase, or just me saying “go fuck everybody.”  it’s an invitation to feel the ever present frequency of love. i’ve been feeling the need to remind myself and others that love reigns supreme - we often get comfortable with the ill ways of the world and accept them. \n\nwhile working on this song, I was around a bunch of older musician guys (well vetted producers/session players known well in the la music scene). They talked about the hippy/60s era - which kind of turned to shit.  and they loved the track but were saying “free love man? we’ve tried that”. I wanted to repurpose the phrase and bring new context (instead of people rolling around in mud).  \n\nThe world is in a dark place with human rights, threats of war, confusion, etc. to me it could use a dose of positive energy.  \n\nenjoy Free Lizzy.",
