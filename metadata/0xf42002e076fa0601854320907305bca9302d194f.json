    "description": "Once rich and opulent, Kolmanskop is henceforth a ghost town invaded by sand and lost in the middle of the Namibian desert. Founded after the discovery of diamonds by German settlers in 1908, it went through a real « diamond rush » and became fast the nerve center of the area due to its rich deposit of diamond. The legend says that even by night, you only had to go down to find diamonds in the sand thanks to the moonlight. Kolmanskop faced a striking prosperity that attracts many adventurers or other prospectors from all Africa ; prosperity symbolized by the fact that the inhabitants of Kolmanskop used to get their clean water from Cape Town in South Africa or that they imported their Champaign from Reims ! Kolmanskop emerges from the soil very quickly, as the new immigrants settled in the city. From a German inspiration, we can soon find there an hospital, a butcher shop, a bakery, an ice fabric, a bowling, a casino, a school, a power plant and even a swimming pool ! ",
