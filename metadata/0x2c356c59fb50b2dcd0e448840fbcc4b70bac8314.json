    "description": "For as much time as I have spent in the ocean, there have only been a handful of days where the water was as clear as it was on this morning.  I was diving with a group of my close friends in one of our favorite spots during the summertime.  Picture six adults splashing around, gleeful and delighted over how far visibility stretched beneath us - nearly 30 meters of clarity.  The light rays from the sun penetrate the water differently on those days.\n\nHawaiian sea turtle, shot on 35mm B&W film while freediving. 2022.",
