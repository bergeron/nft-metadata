    "description": "Early backer membership card for the Crypto Whale Club. Entails the holder to future benefits down the road. Whales (Bulls) is an expressionist representation and commentary on the New Creative Economy, Crypto-Art, and the NFT Space. The piece features Adam Disbrowâ€™s distinct use of layering and symbols to create a free space for the mind and eye to express itself honestly, while simultaneously providing objective commentary on the current Crypto-Culture. Also prominent is Disbrow's 'Quanta' or 'Fractal of Creation' -- Single Square with Line Through -- the 'Forks and Spoons' of tactile sensation, and his signature 'Gold Square.' Whales (Bulls) was created for the Crypto Whale Club as an Exclusive Membership Card for the most bullish of the crypto whales.
