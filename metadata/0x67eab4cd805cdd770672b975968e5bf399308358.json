On August 2022 Opensea banned me from the platform as other artists in Cuba and countries like Venezuela and Iran. \nThis collection aims to return the NFTs to the owners. \n\nPlay and trust  \nSold: 11/29/2021  \nto: \n0xa88ca43d06ed3107a1555987388faa7fda71e395\n\nPlay and trust (short story by María Jesús)  \nI play and dream. I play and trust. I play and hope. \"Follow your dreams\", they say. \"Dreams come true\". \"You don't fight enough\". \"You don't believe enough\". \"You don't pay enough for the bauble that's going to save you\".  \nI stand on my island surrounded by blue, I see the fences and walls (ours and others), and by the way, the cracks in the walls, the leaks and the scaffolding. A thousand corpses of dreams whisper in my ear, and I think that the Universe only conspires so that we cannot understand it.  \nBut I play and I wait. I play and trust. I play and dream. And the strings exorcise my doubts.",
