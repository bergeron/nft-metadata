    "description": "There are two friends that I've known since I was less than a year old. We formed a music band together, and then one moved out to the Pyrenees mountains while we were still kids. We stayed close friends though.\n\nAnd as I started making electronic music, he would listen to my songs every weekend or so, encouraging me in the process. All my songs were similar to each other and not well refined, but I had this one thing that I was trying to create over and over.\n\nAbout 8 years later we were back together in the countryside, where we grew up, and I played \"Ten Thirty Seven\", a song made in 2023. I told him \"it's the same music I've been trying to make since we were teens\", and he replied \"yes, but it's getting better\". So this is the latest version of my one thing.\n\nMAXIM PERUMAL",
