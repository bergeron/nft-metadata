    "description": "This is a the first in a series of 11 black & white photographs that capture the abstract movements of water. Made in the darkroom, I used a light pen to draw onto water with a sheet of light sensitive paper beneath the water to capture the movements of my light pen. As I drew, I had no idea what the final result would be until I placed the light sensitive paper into the developing chemicals to watch the final result slowly reveal itself.",
