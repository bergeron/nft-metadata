    "description": "ever since my grandpa's death, I come up with all sorts of coping mechanisms.\n\none of them is creating these scenarios of him, having a completely different life, living in some beautiful old house.\n\nthere's a sense of comfort in imagining him being alive and enjoying his life, even without me or his other family members, just living for himself, all alone and healthy, not sick in some hospital room. \n\nhe was the light of my life, so I follow the light, the rays of the sun, to find his new home and then I wait, just for a little while, for him to show up.",
