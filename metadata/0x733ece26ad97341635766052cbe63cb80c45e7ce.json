    "description": "I was sick for the past week, probably from exhaustion..being out frequently..but I got a new guitar..Which I'm extremely happy about!\n\nSo yesterday I started playing some stuff and one thing led to another.. Not the usual case where the process is filmed and what not, so this is as raw a demo as It can get (if it weren't just a voice-memo). I was super stuffy, but started singing and I took a liking to how I sounded.\n\nFigured I'd continue fleshing out the beat and just getting it out there. Yesterday Create, Today a light mix, Now to Upload!\n\nThough I'm getting used to not overthinking music creation and giving it all the packaging... I'll continue this streamline process.\n\nThe concept of \"Radio Silence Pt.1\" to me, I've been elated to be involved in this space and in support of all the fellow pioneers herein. This is just another contribution to art. The song represents to me, \"The death of radio\", the hardships that come with being an artist, and having to sustain oneself through the commodization of said art.",
