Do they make us feel safe and whole, or bound and lonely?\n\n\"You, sent out beyond your recall,  \ngo to the limits of your longing.  \nEmbody me.\n\nFlare up like a flame  \nand make big shadows I can move in.\"            \n          \n- Rainer Maria Rilke, Book of Hours\n\n---  \nPainted from life with acrylic on board, now updated to find its home on-chain.\n\n\"I love my Body\" series celebrates our bodies in quick gestures--passing moments that say \"This is me, I am. \"\n\nThis work is part of the Everything Passes Collection: \nPaintings exploring passing moments in life, the big and small of the everyday: our bodies, quiet victories, relationships up close, beauty around us.",
