    "description": "This is song 3 from CACOPHONY, a new project from Reo Cragun and myself. CACOPHONY is a beautiful explosion. Deafeningly loud and chaotic and intimate at the same time. \n\nMY WEAKNESS is a sonic bedrock of this project - it started with a beat I made specifically with Reo in mind and underwent many, many revisions. New tempos, new production ideas, at least 4 iterations of the chorus, additional guitar stems from my friend Bobby Lord, all taking place over at least a year of back and forth.\n\nMY WEAKNESS crashes into being and is loud without remit but at the heart of it is a simple love song. About a love so powerful that it takes you over.  And your whole world, your whole being, coalesces around your goals with one person. Reo and I are both lucky enough to have people like that in our lives. This is a tribute to them.",
