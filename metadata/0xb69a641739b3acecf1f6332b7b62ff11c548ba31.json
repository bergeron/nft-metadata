    "description": "The Hundred Pacer Snake is one of Taiwan's most admired, and feared snakes. \n\nLegend has it, if you are bitten by the Hundred Pacer, you have only 100 steps before you collapse on the ground, and succumb to its venom. \n\nThe Hundred Pacer is also revered by the Paiwan tribe of Taiwan, and is viewed as their creator god. The patterns of the snake are also seen on the clothing, houses, ceramics and tattoos.\n\n\"The hundred-pacer snake is one of the major characters in Paiwan mytho­logy, and it is generally considered to be the procreator of the nobles and, in some episodes, of the com­moners as well. With local variations in details, the focal theme of the procreation myths is that a female human accepted a marriage propos­al from a snake, but not without strong dissent from her family. Jars with snake designs were given to the woman’s family by the snake as brideprice, along with the privilege of using the snake design.\"",
