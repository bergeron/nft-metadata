    "description": "I began my photography journey taking photos of the ocean. Surfers gliding across the waves and sunsets on the beach consumed my first 2 years behind the lens. During that time I came across the panning technique, where you move the camera with subject so that everything in the photo is blurry except for that one figure. Surf photographers employ this to create the illusion of speed and motion in a still photograph and there was a time where I was obsessed with this style. While trying to capture the elusive sharp surfer amongst blurry waves, I became intrigued by the the patters amongst the waves themselves. Eventually I gave up on capturing the surfer and focused on these patterns, swinging my camera back and forth at the ocean until I got a photo I was happy with. About one in 30 frames would result in something really neat, and those are the photos you see here.",
