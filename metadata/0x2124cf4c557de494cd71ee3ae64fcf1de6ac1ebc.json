    "description": "Volatile statum essendi [volatile state of being]\n\n “A picture of my existence... would show a useless wooden stake covered in snow... stuck loosely at a slant in the ground in a ploughed field on the edge of a vast open plain on a dark winter night.” ― from Metamorphosis (Franz Kafka).\n\nThis chemigram intends to define and portray a vision of the volatility of the human condition. It was painted with darkroom chemicals on photographic paper, a process that is itself volatile. \n\nIn addition, the collector will receive a high resolution and digitally calibrated scanned image [600dpi]. For more information, please, contact me on my Twitter handle.",
