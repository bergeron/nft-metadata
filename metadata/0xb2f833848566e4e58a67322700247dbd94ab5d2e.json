    "description": "The goal is to play with contrasts between realistic natural forms such as vegetal elements, switching between simple shapes and super complicated ones. Same for the textures, mixing realistic ones and artificial flat ones. \n\nThe whole collection has a weird balance between natural and artificial. The vivid colours also play a big role in the composition, balancing between realistic desaturated and super bright. \n\nIncluding tactile elements like rough or smooth surfaces and warm or cool lighting can create a sense of touch. How would they feel if we could touch them? How would they smell, sound, taste? The idea is to stimulate the five senses. \n\nThis places us as human beings in the current era, stuck somewhere between the real and the virtual world, separated by screens, and not knowing anymore what’s real and what’s not.",
