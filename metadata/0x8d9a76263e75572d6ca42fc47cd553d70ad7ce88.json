    "description": "In the city of Chiang Mai, more than 800 km north far away from my hometown, what a strange place for me. \n\nAll I could do was wondering around shooting with loneliness and befriended with the ray of sunshine. At the moment as a photographer,  I was really glad that I can see this beauty with my own eyes. The moment that I know that I want to keep shooting photos for the rest of my life.",
