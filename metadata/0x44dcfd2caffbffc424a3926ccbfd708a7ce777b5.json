    "description": "This image was captured by Byron while leading a morning safari drive in the pristine wilderness of Timbavati, a Private Nature Reserve on the edges of the famous Kruger National Park. He had the privilege of observing this leopard and his sister growing up in 2019 under the excellent guidance of their mother, ‘Moya’ (translated to ‘spirit/soul’ in Shangaan/Xitsonga). \n\n“At just over a year of age, the two siblings were beginning to explore their surroundings with more confidence while their mother was away, hunting for the three of them. In this particular encounter, the young male leopard led us to a dense area, sat at eye level in the dappled light, and displayed various facial expressions while grooming and yawning just a few meters from us. This is one of the most relaxed and confident leopards I’ve ever had the privilege of getting to know and that mostly comes down to how he has been raised by his mother. I’m sure he is now thriving in his own territory as he comes into his prime and I hope to meet him again someday.”",
