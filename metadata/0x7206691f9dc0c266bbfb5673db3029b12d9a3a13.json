    "name": "CRETEIDE MOTHER",
    "description": "Creteide Mother is an incredible and mysterious artwork in the Enigmatic Mothers series. This series is composed of eighteen works that, together, have the task of holding the clues to solve a great riddle yet to be discovered.\n\nThe Creteid Mother, in particular, is a work characterised by the imposing presence of the mother figure. The woman depicted seems ancient and wise, and her erect and decisive posture communicates strength and inner stability. But the particularity of this figure is her mask: a face with an indecipherable expression that seems to conceal a secret.\n\nThe dark, deep colours of the main image alternate with lighter, brighter shades. This creates an effect of depth and structure typical of all the works in the series.\n\nThe Enigmatic Mothers series is a unique opportunity to admire surprising works of art and a challenge for all fans of puzzles and mysteries. Each piece holds a series of clues, and the final secret can be discovered only by solving all the riddles.",
