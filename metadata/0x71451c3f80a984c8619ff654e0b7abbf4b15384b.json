    "description": "Mind's Eye is a series about the pareidolia effect, repression and the unconscious. The series explores the deep, dark and the disordered, through art, while using the noble aesthetic of nature, flowers and trees. What do we really see when we go deeper with our look? The perfect symmetric structure that we are desperately looking for to slack the mind, while our unconscious is in need of a disturbance, to be untamed.",
