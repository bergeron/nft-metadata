    "description": "58.7 seconds. That was the duration of totality, the moment the moon covered the sun completely, during the Oregon 2017 solar eclipse. \n\nIt is said that witnessing a total solar eclipse is a spiritual experience. The tears that streamed down both our faces and the gratitude we shared for that moment confirmed those sentiments. ",
