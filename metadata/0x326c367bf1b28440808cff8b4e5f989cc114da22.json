    "description": "A desire... secretly kept in the bottomest corner of my heart, untouched. A wish, which the heart made in a seconds blink when Rose laid down with the Heart of the Ocean.\n\nRemember, when our parents used to skip this very part of Titanic... Goodness I always wondered what happened next... until when I learnt to use the internet for school projects...\n\nAs a teenager this scene got imprinted in my memory and heart. Not because she undressed but because her name was Rose and her desire to be drawn with the rarest diamond was a heavy emotion to me. A woman's desire to break her chains and explore in love has always inspired me...\n\nI wanted to feel the same as her... hair tangled in my fingers... with heart racing as I waited for the moment to capture quickly.\nA trembling chest on the white sheets with Celine in my ears... my skin blossomed like a million roses matching the symphony... with its veins entangling around my heart forever.\n.\n.\n\nManjushree.\n\n13800px X 9200px, 575ppi\n\n\n\n",
