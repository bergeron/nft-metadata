Through likes, interactions, conversations, contacts, clicks and visited pages, different corporations identify the information that interests you, enclosing you in an echo chamber created by algorithms that only offer you the reflection of your own interests, limiting the universe of information that exists and pretending to be a free space, even if it is quite the opposite.\n\nFrom the series Echo Chamber\nFrom the project The End of the Internet",
