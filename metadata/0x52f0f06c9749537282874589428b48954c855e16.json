    "description": "Like many elves of Remenia her age, Mellow likes to take long journeys to places she hasnâ€™t visited in decades. Rediscovering the ever changing shores along the Endless Ocean became one of her favorite things to do in the past seventy years. The salt in the air and the unpredictable gusts of wind brought in by the turquoise waves is a nice change of pace compared to her usual place of residence up in the mountains. Even so, her heart belongs to the slowly swaying grass and the murmuring pines surrounded by the snow covered peaks she calls home.",
