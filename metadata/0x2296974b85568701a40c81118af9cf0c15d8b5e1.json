    "description": "The Forrest Abode is one of the multi-edition artwork from Living Spaces collection.\n\n\"Living Spaces\" is a collection of minimalist art that takes inspiration from the architectural design of houses. The pieces in this collection likely depict simple, clean lines and shapes that evoke the aesthetic of a minimalist home interior or exterior. The focus of this collection is likely on the form and structure of the house rather than on any specific details or ornamentation. Overall it is a modern minimalist art collection that creates a contemplative and serene atmosphere.",
