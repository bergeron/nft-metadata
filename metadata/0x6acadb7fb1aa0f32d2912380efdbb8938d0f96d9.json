    "description": "PHOTO\n\nThe photo has been captured along the Malecon in Havana, it was 5 a.m and I was starting a documentary showing the wake up of this amazing cuban city.\nI met a few fishermen going to start their day, a few people running along the Malecon and others stopping to stretch out.\nWhen I saw this girl stopping I set the tripod and hoped to be able to capture her, without too much motion, and the seaside, the lights of the city.\nThis is a long exposure, despite I had to keep it as short as possible to avoid a ghostly figure.\n\nHavana - Cuba\n\nLICENSE\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.\nThe license includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder.
