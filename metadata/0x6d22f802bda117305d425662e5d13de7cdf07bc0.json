    "description": "RED is probably one of the most complicated colors. It is powerful, eye-catching, it has been used by humans for thousands years.\n\nIn different cultures it is the color of power, love, beauty & death.\n\nRed is powerful yet feminine. It can be either warm or cold, like every woman. So I couldn't depict it as just a pretty woman.  \nMy red lady is calm & tender, but may go to extremes if needed.  \nShe looks mature and dreamy, she has gone through hardships that made her wiser. She is strong, self-confident, patient, kind & embracing.\n\nThe kind of mother I hope to be one day.\n\nRed is controversial like the life itself. Itâ€™s up to you to decide whether it is a red carpet or a red flag.\n\nTraditional gouache art, 2022.",
