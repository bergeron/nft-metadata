    "description": "The old soul of Johnny \"the gunfighter\", souls in color series\n\nTOM HOFF\nworked in 2022\n\n2048*2732pixel, 300DPI\nPNG\n\nThe colors we see tell us our own interpretation of reality. No one sees colors the same way you see them. The light, your way of interpreting them and your mood help you to make a construction of what you are and want to see. These souls are interpretations of fictional characters that wander through lights in this world. ",
