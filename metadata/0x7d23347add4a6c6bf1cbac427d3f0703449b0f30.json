    "description": "Blue is connected to Shiva, the destroyer of evil. Shiva the creator, creates life among the ruins of old energy that withstands the change. Tranquility symbolizes the recreation of energy. Just like the blue color of the oceans, the rivers, the lakes, blue means change. Our energy goes through similar cycles; after the wildest of tides, our inner ocean achieves the state of tranquility.\n\nA meditative audiovisual experience\n\n2160x2160, 20 sec",
