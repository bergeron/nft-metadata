    "description": "Jimothy the squirrel has always been a healthy boy. He obsession with working out has come from a fear of being run over by cars. One day when Jimothy was a child squirrel he witnessed a tragic accident where his friend Bobert had a tree fall on top of him. Jimothy wished he had the strength to lift the tree off of Bobert, but he could not help his friend at the time. From that moment onward, Jimothy vowed to build the strength so that no other friend of his would ever be squashed by a rogue falling tree. Jimothy hates vegetables, but he eats them because that is what he needs to do. Jimothy is the nut lifting champion.",
