The different 'scenes' can be advanced using the double arrows on the outside of the bottom menu, or by selecting a frame's thumbnail - which can be seen by using the 4-squared button. \n\nAlternate focal lengths can be selected by right-clicking (long press on mobile). \nFull screen is advised.  \nThe bottom menu can be hidden.  \nTry it in VR.\n\nSetup Details: \n1W LaserCube x2 coming off the desktop being reflected downward onto 2 sides of the 'floating mirror triangle' (orange beams)  \n1W LaserCube hung from a overhead going off a mirror mounted right above the centerpiece, reflecting down off the surface and back up through the 'floating mirror triangle' (magenta beams)  \n1W LaserCube through bumpy glass (lumia) being refocused by a 90mm glass ball - creating the blue wreath on the background. \n\n638nm (red) through generic star field diffraction grating onto background  \n505nm (water green) single beam  \n488nm (pretty blue) x3 single beams - one going off 4 Molybdenum mirrors, crossing back and forth in front of the camera\n\nGlass/Mirrors  \n@r0bp's Glass #Being \n4 Crystal Pillars  \n2x 50mm glass balls  \nLots of custom cut 1st surface mirrors - most harvested from rear projection TVs.",
