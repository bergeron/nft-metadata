    "description": "On this trip, 14709 is joined by Danny Greene and Mrs. Meebit to explore the vast and beautiful Iberá Wetlands in Argentina. This place is a remote and truly unique National Park managed by the wonderful people at Rewilding Argentina, heir to the legacy of Tompkins Conservation.  \n\nThis is not only a beautiful place though, there's way more to unwrap here.\n\nIt all started years ago with 'Tobuna', one of the first jaguars to be re-introduced in the area. Since then, giant otters, anteaters, pampa deer, scarlet macaws and many other species were successfully rewilded into a balance as originally intended by nature.\n\n1/1\n4935 × 6169\n\nThe collector also receives a signed ultraHD print in ArtBox with certificate of authenticity.",
