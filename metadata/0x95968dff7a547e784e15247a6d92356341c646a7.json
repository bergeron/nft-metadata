    "description": "Unknown XXXL, a psychologist from Oxford, carried out a project to study the phenomenon of \"pay it forward\".\n\nThe essence of this philosophical concept is expressed in \"do good to a stranger\" in the hope that he will show the same kindness to someone else.\n\nUnknown XXXL is fascinated by the potential of this philosophical movement, the idea that a single act of kindness can have a domino effect, spreading waves of goodwill around the world. There are many reasons why unselfish acts calm the soul.\n\nUnknown XXXL, in the course of his own research, has found that impulses of greed are more likely to spread among masses faster than generosity. But kindness allows you to give something back to society, and it makes you feel better by giving you an understanding of your love. You can be kind. You can change someone's life. You can make a miracle happen.",
