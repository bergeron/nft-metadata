    "description": "The first of a seven part audio visual series created using an ancient in-real-life 2000 year old Lar - a brass Roman figurine held at Guildhall Museum. Lars were kept as household gods - as confidants and protectors. \n\nThe Lar was used as a sensing object to create a piece of abstract electronic vocal music made using the artist's trAnSition AI app. The Lar's natural harmonic resonances peaked at 703Hz - and the piece of music was built around this frequency - giving voice to its mystical, silent protection.\n\nThe music created as part of 10 Songs for a Lar - Kent-Medway Museum Partnership.\n\nThe visuals were made using bespoke animation, and a touchdesigner-pollinations to create unique sound reactive movement - bringing the Lar to life once again.\n\nIn spirit of open source 5% will go to pollinations.",
