    "description": "Every 365 days, my sanctum will evolve- recreate itself into a new piece of art while retaining its true essence.\n\nThis is the beginning of a journey where existing barriers within our homelands tumble and creative possibilities flourish.\n\nMy sacred space is the visualisation of restorative nostalgia and the longing for 'new'. We understand the 'new' in terms of the known, forging new knowledge by stitching together the dissimilar. This is my goal with sanctum. As part of proof-of- learning, this will evolve through different vantage points and different medium for eternity on-chain.\n\nDimensions: 4800 * 4800\nInk on Hahnem√ºhle German Etching\nPrimary Collector receives Physical signed artwork.\n",
