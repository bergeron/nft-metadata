We can build and we can destroy, it is up to us to choose what kind of use we will make of them.\nThis photo was taken at the top of the slab of the house under construction where workers were assembling the iron frame network that would support the entire roof of the residence. \nIn one of the moments that the structure was being erected, I asked one of the workers to stop for a minute while I focused and watched his hands in the act of twisting a steel bar.\nThis is the image that inspired me the most in the conception of this work, summarizing all the strength of the details that constitute our involvement with work as well as in relationships with others.\n\n5309 x 7087 pixels / 300 dpi / 3.95 MB\n\nCanon AE1 program\nCanon A1\nCanon 70-210/f4 FD\nCanon 50/f1.4 FD\nMicrotek ScanMaker i900\nFilm Ilford HP5",
