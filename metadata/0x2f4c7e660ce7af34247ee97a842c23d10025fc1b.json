    "description": "A few weeks fresh from a breakup, my feelings were exactly like the lemon tart that my ex used to make — sweet and comforting memories of our time together co-existed with the sour taste of how it all ended.\n\nThis is probably the most vulnerable and raw song song I’ve written to date and I’m proud to release it as my solo-debut on Sound.\n\n---\n\nTo collectors — thanks so much for supporting me with this release.\n\n(1) I'm extending presale access to everyone who collected Lost in the Light (my collab with greydient). And also $PRESENT token holders, as a thanks to everyone to all my friends in Chaos & Songcamp.\n\n(2) A 5% split is going to my friend Prashant (aka Carrom Board) who helped bring this song to life. I'm using this as a way of onboarding him to web3.\n\n(3) I'll be investing the other 95% back into promoting Lemon Tart on web2 + into the upcoming album that I've been working on with greydient. \n\n(4) For the golden egg collector, I also plan to record a custom video of me playing a live acoustic version of this song.\n\n---\n\nLYRICS\n\nLemon tart and summer breeze\nRun by the river and the maple trees\nSeize the moment to tell me you love me\nI’d have to say I agree\nCoffee cake and sleepy tea\nOn the couch I made it’s you and me\nWe fall asleep before 10:30\nWe’re hanging out in our dreams\n\nForehead kisses, make a wish\nI wish I'd miss you just a little less today\n\nEarly morning summer rain\nDappled light shines through thе window pane\nSkin to skin, feel your breath on my neck\nAnd I’m lost till you whispеr my name\nLate to the station and I miss my train\nGuess I’ll have to stay another day\nI’ll stay with you for as long as you’ll have me\nUntil you’ll send me away\n\nOh the taste is bittersweet\nBittersweet, the taste is bittersweet",
