    "description": "\"seconds left to get rid of\" is a dynamic NFT artwork that displays a timer counting down the seconds until the end of a 20-year fascist regime. This powerful artwork represents the struggle for freedom and a better future after two decades of oppression.\n\nThe timer ticks down relentlessly, reminding us of the urgency of the situation and the need for action. As the seconds pass by, we are filled with anticipation and anxiety, wondering if and when the end will come.\n\nThis NFT artwork is a powerful symbol of resistance and hope, and a reminder that we must continue to fight for freedom, justice, and equality. With each passing second, we are one step closer to the end of tyranny and the dawn of a new era of freedom.",
