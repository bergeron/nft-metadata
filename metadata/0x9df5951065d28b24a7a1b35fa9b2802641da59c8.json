I am releasing this on Valentines Day purposely as I feel it can be a very 'rom com' style day and everything and every one else's life can seem more together than yours. This is a reminder that you can romanticise your own life and start to see great things happening for yourself.\n\nOnce all 25 NFT editions have sold, I will raffle off an original painted one to one of the collectors. Digital printed words and acrylic paint on A3 heavy gsm canvas paper.",
