    "description": "\"Perfect crime\" or \"Abbey Road 2.0\" \n\nThe cover of the famous album of The Beatles \"Abbey Road\" stuck in my memory since childhood. So it's no surprise, that as an adult, I wanted to get a little touch of the art of my childhood idols and came up with my fun reimagining of this cover, keeping the overall style and color scheme, but adding a bit of childish madness from the past.\n\n\n1/1\n3676 x 3676",
