    "name": "The Navigator, Fungal Dancer",
    "description": "The Navigator, or Fungal Dancer, is a singular entity within the artist’s ongoing simulated worlds of wetland mythologies. Abstract figures move, float, and guide the viewer through subterranean caverns, seemingly buried pools, and chthonic passages carving out changing landscapes. \n\nThis work marks Steensen’s emerging development of entities that ‘live’ across multiple artworks. The fungal dancer pulses and sings; it evokes observed animal practices of singing to landscapes as ways of navigating them, sonic models for learning topography and direction, danger and safety. The Dancer is made by carefully 3D- photographing a turkey tail mushroom, then animating its movement to mimic what is called the Spanish Dancer, an iconic underwater sea slug that the artist observed and filmed while diving. \n\nA mix of fabulation, fantasy, interpretation, and abstraction, the Navigator is a literal virtual model of emergence, moving only in response and relation to the sounding of its environs.",
