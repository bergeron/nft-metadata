    "description": "\nWhen I arrived in this hidden valley for the first time I was amazed by how beautiful and enchanting it was, a hidden gem in the mountains. And I was there, enchanted by this masterpiece of nature while a light breeze licked my face and the sun warmed my skin. A creek that \nunfolded like a snake wound its way through the green, in front of majestic mountains that stood sheer towards the sky. Because, if you like me are lovers of the fantastic world created by J. R. R. Tolkien, you will understand why I chose this title for such an incredible place",
