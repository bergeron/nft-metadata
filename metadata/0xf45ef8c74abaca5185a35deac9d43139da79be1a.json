    "description": "The Drurus Dusk is built for the community of DAFI Protocol to burn rubber in Nitro League. The trademark car of the DAFInauts, a resilient race that learned to react to market conditions to not only protect themselves from danger, but to grow and thrive with the networks accordingly. If the smell of Nitro is in the air, or there's an electric blue streak zooming in the distance, you know you're in DAFInaut territory. The Drurus Dusk is programmed to be resilient, fast, and reactive - just like the DAFInauts that drive them. Take the wheel and take your destiny. "
