    "description": "It is believed that ''Shahmaran'', Queen of all serpents, lives underground in Anatolia. She is  a wise healer, symbol of wealth and wellness. In Anatolia, Shahmaran pictures hang on the walls of homes for good luck and prosperity; and according to a belief, Shahmaran chooses her master.\n\nI have reimagined Shahmaran accompanied by nine medicinal herbs.",
