    "name": "Fragments #2: Fishing Boats of Dorset",
    "description": "Fishing Boats around the county of Dorset in the South West UK. I love the weathered textures seen on these boats and have been photographing them for many years. \n\nI love the organic nature of the artwork of these boats, which serve a deeply practical use every day in all kinds of weather. The textures and patterns tell many stories of the sea and the countless people who have worked on the boats.\n\nPhotographic NFT - JPEG\n3900 x 3900 x 300dpi \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
