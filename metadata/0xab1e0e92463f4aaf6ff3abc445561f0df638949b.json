    "description": "This is the first air drop edition of a series of art works. They will trace a continual evolution and a lifetime's commitment to art. \n\nTo hold this token is to hold a key to my own journey. I have chosen Shackleton's Endurance trapped in ice for several reasons. Mostly it's because he was not able to survive without the help of his crew and his friends. And it's also because sometimes doing something doesn't really tell you much about why it should be done until after the journey is over. \n\nHere's to seeing the entire journey through.",
