At first I felt a little uncomfortable, but now I really like the style. I tried to create a manga/anime character, as I really appreciate the illustrations in this art genre. I wanted the work to be clearly recognizable as manga, but I still wanted to keep as much of my sketchy style as possible. I managed to do that quite nicely, I think. Maybe there will be more in this direction in the future.\n\nFlo",
