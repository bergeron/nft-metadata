    "description": "TMESIS - 1 hour, 3 minutes, 22 seconds\n\nTmesis is an audiovisual digital art object by Massimo Magee, designed to be read by the computer as both a visual still image and as a piece of audio, these being two readings of the same file. It includes processed image data and virtual organ sounds generated from the image data. \n\nExperience it as a slow-building ritual of maximalism & intensity. \n\nThe piece was shaped across visual and audio domains functionally simultaneously, meaning that a change in the visual also affected the audio and vice versa. When you look at the visual reading, you are seeing all of the data including the audio; when you listen to the audio reading, you are hearing all of the data including the visual. While human observers require separate visual and audio readings, only the computer can perceive the whole piece in its natural state as one file with both audio and visual aspects. For this NFT, the visual and audio readings have been re-combined into a video file.",
