    "name": "DARKNESS AND LIGHT",
    "description": "Without knowing what darkness and cold are, we would never know the happiness of daylight and warmth. It is important to visit the darkest corners of our souls, because in the end, there is always light there. All we have to do is make up our mind.\n\nBy accepting our dark side, we allow the light side to manifest itself, without fear or internal conflict. But sometimes we can remain on the dark side by denying its existence. ",
