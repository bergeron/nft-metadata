    "description": "1/1 vector art \n\nThis art is about lightness, grace and beauty. The main silhouette of the character came to me playfully: I drew a sketch just for fun in seconds. I liked the result so much that I decided to make a full art and collection out of it. For this I already had to work hard, to tweak the sketch, think about colors and composition. But it was a joy because Graceful Goose was positive from the beginning and a pleasure to work with. Frankly, not all of my drawings go that smoothly. This art also reminds me of my dream of learning to dance. I believe that someday I will do it as well as Graceful Goose.\n\n4291  x  6071 px",
