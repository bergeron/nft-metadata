    "description": "\"I feel as deep a connection to language as I do to images, though they’ve always lived in separate compartments of my brain. Writing sentences that convert to pictures feels oddly like a dream come true. I have no recollection of having had that dream but the process feels like it was born from an unconscious  wish. It interests me that some people are frightened by AI picture making technologies and think it will be the end of art and create a generation of lazy artists. New technologies frighten people. We know that Plato reported Socrates' condemnation of the rise of writing. In this narrative Socrates insists that writing 'will introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it'.  For me the fear and resistance to AI image generators makes the text to image process more appealing\". -  Laurie Simmons\n\nEdition: 1 of 1",
