    "description": "The secret of life is in establishing the relationship between the visible and the invisible. It is like a fruit with a peel and a core. The shell is the visible laws and the core is the truth, 'essence reality'. Grasping the essence is difficult as it requires an inner journey. However, this understanding is peculiar to those who know how to reach it by getting out of the outer shapes and forms, which cover the truth by discovering what is beneath the visible, protect and preserve it by nature, and hide it at the same time.",
