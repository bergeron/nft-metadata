    "description": "\"Reflection of Self,\" the first piece in \"Miyagi's Mindscapes,\" is a striking visual representation of the contrast between self-perception and external perception. \n\nThe piece masterfully captures the idea of how our own view of ourselves may differ from how we are perceived by the outside world through the use of contrasting colors.\n\nThe piece evokes strong emotions and encourages the viewer to reflect on their own experiences and perceptions. This thought-provoking and emotional depiction of the human experience is certain to spark meaningful discussions among art enthusiasts.",
