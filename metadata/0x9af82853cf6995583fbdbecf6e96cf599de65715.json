    "description": "Through the looking glass, one is none but thousands of lifeforms. In constant dynamics, they morph through interactions, form and reform. A complex ecosystem designed to evolve. To discern one’s hunger, to capture one’s truth. A giant culturing flask, uniquely individual, with no other will than one’s own.\n\nThe Psiloformers is a custom-trained AI module on a on two big datasets – microscopic fungal colonies, and real human profiles.\n\nK-KAD is a series of collections by Khaled Kaddal, an installation artist, performer and technologist based in London. The project is supported by the Arts Helsinki (Uniarts) and the Saastamoinen Foundation, in Helsinki (Finland).",
