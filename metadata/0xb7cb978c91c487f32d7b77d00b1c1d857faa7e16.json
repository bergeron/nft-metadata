    "description": "$100k pfp is in response to the absolute shit storm surrounding @Yieldasaurus tweet:\n\n\"If you are rocking a PFP under $100k please don't @ me or share your opinion on my wall...\"\n\nThis tweet led to the 100k pfp meme storm. One for which i very much enjoyed. The tweet was later deleted forever BUT this nft is a memory of that special day.\n\nThe $100k is in done in comic sans so it's value is probably worth $1,000,000",
