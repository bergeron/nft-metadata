    "description": "Size: 9232px * 10000px\n\n**Please zoom in to check the amazing details, and may be right click to save it locally to do further zoom in**\n\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights created by Jheronimus Bosch showing humans were indulging in fascinating and dangerous pleasures in the gap between heaven and hell. What I wonder is, what it would be like if there was a garden belonged to robots, or if humans use robots as avatars to enjoy their life in metaverse.\n\nThis question probably should be answered by machines themself. Therefore, I collaborated with artificial intelligence to convert the original work to the robotic version, and overlapped manually editing with my own understanding, to finish the final re-creation, which should show the absurd joy belongs to robots and the chaotic beauty from technology.\n\n耶罗尼米斯·博斯的尘世乐园，表现了人类在天堂和地狱的夹缝间，纵享既迷人又危险的欢愉。我好奇的是，如果有一个属于机器的乐园，或者人类使用机器（的形象）作为替身在元宇宙中尽情享乐时，又会是怎样的一个情景呢？\n\n这个问题或许只有机器本身才能回答。因此，我结合了人工智能对原作进行转译，并根据自己的理解对输出结果进行手工编辑并完成二次创作，展现了属于机械的荒诞欢愉和属于技术的混沌美。",
