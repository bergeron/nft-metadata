    "description": "\"Be Nature\" is a series where I combine the human body with other nature elements in an organic and harmonic way.  Celebrating the beauty and perfection of body.  We are nature, we are ONE.\n\nDo you know when all things looks like wrong but if you look into carefully, you understand that the universe conspired in a perfect way?   The day of these photos were made was like this, way better than I can image.  Trust life, trust the movements, keep your energy high and everything else will be great.\n\n\nArtist: Rodolfo Coelho\nPortugal, 2019\n1/1 JPEG 4160 x 6240px / 300 ppp made on a FUJI XT3",
