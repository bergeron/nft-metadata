    "description": "The sea feeds on your eyes.\nAnd every time I think about you, I sink to a sea which wants the rain from your eyes selfishly. \nMy thoughts are restless like the waves of the sea which bang a memory of you into my brain walls every time. \nI am tired this time and I want to shout and recite my last poem out loud:\n\n\"If with your hands\nYou do not save me\nat least with them\npull the trigger\"\n.\nPoem, art & motion : \"vosoughi\"\n.\nFile : Mp4 \nSize :  2684*2500\n.\nSound on",
