    "name": "\"Is There More?\" : A Lucid Dream",
    "description": "Is there more to life than what I know…what I have known? Is the world really as big as it seems? Am I just going through the motions or am I on a path to something bigger than me, bigger than what I could ever imagine. After 2016, the years just seemed to overlap each other. Ended chapters led me to isolation and anxiety. But with that pain came wisdom, embracing my heartache and gaining inner peace with the series of events that have molded me and led me to this very moment. Through everything I’ve lost and gained, my heart has grown 3 sizes. Now I cherish life for what it is, the highs and the lows, expecting the unexpected, turning my dreams into something real. Discovering the person that is me and all my capabilities. Opening my heart to new possibilities and setting fire to the fear of change. Leaving the writing of the following chapters in my life to a higher power. If you're reading or hearing this, you are now a witness to this journey. thank you.\n\nWith Love & Faith,\nSerena",
