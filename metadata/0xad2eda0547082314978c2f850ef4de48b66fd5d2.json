    "description": "Animals in Distress - Animals of Mariupol #1\n\nAnimals of Mariupol is a series of several artworks that invite people to witness suffering that animals experience during times of war. \n\nCity of Mariupol is chosen as a symbol of war because this is a city that was ravaged by Russian troops the most during the terrorist invasion. War in Ukraine is the closest and most important war happening to my hometown of Vilnius, it is a war that everyone can relate to within the eastern part of Europe.\n\nDuring times of conflict animals in Zoos are often abandoned, they are left to starve or die because of the shelling. They have nowhere to run. Owners of these animals can't take them on the run because wild animals are too big and untamed, also the owners often become victims of violence, die themselves and the animals are left alone.\n\nTools: Oil Pastels on Watercolor Paper, Photoshop\nImage Size: 3516x2836\n\nThis artwork has a redeemable Physical oil-pastel illustration.
