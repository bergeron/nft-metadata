    "description": "Ceiling lamp made from small pieces of vintage Fischer C4 skis. The characteristic red, white and blue colours of the upper surface of the ski is still clearly recognizable. The lamp is hanging in a white room and its triangular shadow pattern is visible behind it. There is nothing else to see, and the room being just an abstract \"white cube\" makes the lamp's shadow a separate object, pretty huge if compared to its original.\n\nNFT only, original installation not included.",
