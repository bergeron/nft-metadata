    "description": "If you still don't know anything about the black cat in my stories, now I will explain to you so that you can get to know this black cat.  \nI'm the black cat, my soul is in this cat and it lives in the cat's body and lives in different places.  \nOne of the days when I was resting under the sun, the movement of butterflies caught my attention.  \n At that moment, I was engrossed in watching the sky and butterflies and I wished I had wings and could fly! Suddenly, when I opened my eyes, I saw myself in the tallest building in the city!  \nHow familiar this moment is to me. Deja vu!!!!!!!!  \nThe rainbow that was created above my head from the rays of light!  \nAnd the single eye that looks at me and looks like it is watching the earth and the sky! Maybe he is the God we hear from him!  \nOther eyes that were assistants of one big eye!!  \nThis is the world!  \nBut from another angle that you can't even think about... !",
