    "description": "This piece represents my first two years exploring the world of web3 and NFTs. What originally started as a conceptual series, asking \"what does today mean to you?\", eventually became more personal: \"what does today mean to *me*?\"\n\nLooking at the totality of this project, in which each piece was made one day at a time, I can see events from my life, recall specific moods, remember certain places, and people.\n\nAfter two years creating these pieces daily, experimenting with different minting mechanisms and learning how to navigate the space, I felt it was best to put a lid on Date Pixels for now and direct my resources towards my music and film work, which are more representative of my creative talents and skills.\n\nAnd when the time is right, I do hope to return to Date Pixels some day, as I still have several ideas for directions in which to take this project!\n\nThank you to everyone who has followed my journey so far, and I cannot wait to show you where it's about to go from here!",
