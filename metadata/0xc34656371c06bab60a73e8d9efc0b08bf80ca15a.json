    "description": "Sleeper Hits Volume I: NFT Cribs is the initial drop for Season 1 from Nightkidsnft. NFT Cribs is a generative project using different architectural styles to showcase the talents of 7 unique artists, including 8th Project, Brain Vomit, Cake Nygard, Cullen Colors, Kyokill, Pop Wonder, and Reylarsdam.  The project was inspired by the grandfather of Nightkids Founder David Lopez.  His grandfather, who passed away in 2001, encouraged David to become an architect, and while he didnâ€™t follow this career path, he used it to inspire this first collection.",
