    "description": "In 2013, I started a photography series that sought to inspire viewers to look at their urban surroundings in a new light. By featuring dancers in these settings, I aimed to challenge the way we perceive the spaces we encounter every day. Over the past nine years, this project has grown into a significant body of work that has shaped my career and opened up new opportunities for me. As a special gesture, I would often present the dancers with an instant photograph of our session together. Seeing their joy and pride in these mementos inspired me to start photographing them holding their instant prints. 'Dance Mementos' is a tribute to this ongoing series, showcasing a selection of my favorite images portraying the dancers with their photographs.",
