    "description": "True Colors is inspired by my photograph of the ever-colorful, Yvie Oddly.\n\nFresh off winning RuPaul's Drag Race in 2019, Yvie came home to Denver, CO to perform at PrideFest and celebrate with an elated crowd üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà\n\nTo quote Yvie from the short film I produced during PrideFest, ‚ÄúIf you live out, you live proud. You can accomplish amazing things. You might have to work hard, you might have to fight some obstacles. And there‚Äôs always going to be people who are against you‚Ä¶ But bitch you can do it!\"\n\nThis is for all the beautiful individuals living out loud and expressing their true colors! \n\n3000x3000\nEdition 1/1\n2022\nAI, Digital Drawing, Photoshop",
