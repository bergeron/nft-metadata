    "description": "Hi! Who has ever heard the name \"Kakek Cangkul\"? Do you know who the real Kakek Cangkul is? It is said that Kakek Cangkul is the husband of Nenek Gayung. When he died, Kakek Cangkul's body was not properly buried and caused terror in the community to ask for a proper burial.\n\nWell, Kakek Cangkul I made this maybe a little different. To make it even more scary, I added an ability or power that can shoot fire from his hands, I also made the hoe he was carrying heat up on the tip of his head and the handle I made was also longer than the usual hoe to make it look more scary.\n\nThe setting in this artwork is in a cemetery. I made it like in Indonesia, as seen from the shape of the tombstones and bamboo trees that represent graves in Indonesia in general. The color mood in this artwork is also slightly orange because I set it to be like at dusk or when night falls, because what we know at these times is the time for ghosts to wander! And this represents the time setting of this artwork.",
