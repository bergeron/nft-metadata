    "summary": "Imagineering Lab 01 is my Genesis Space, representing my work processes as I bridge between analogue and digital mediums. All work I create across NFTS and Metaverse spaces start off on paper and are transferred into the digital realm through scanning and splicing, applying ink illustrated art as textures for my 3D creations. The space has 4 built-in Artifacts that demonstrate this aesthetic.",
