    "name": "Transcendence",
    "description": "This piece is about the existence or experience beyond the normal or physical level. Emotion and introspection are explored in their purest abstraction, providing viewers with a multi-layered visual odyssey that encompasses joy and sorrow, strength and vulnerability, conflict and peace, and a visceral sensory experience. As a result, transcendence is connected to a sense of significance and purpose in the world, even if it occurs only momentarily.",
