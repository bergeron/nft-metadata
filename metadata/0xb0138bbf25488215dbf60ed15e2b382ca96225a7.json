    "description": "Designed by [Blind Camel](https://rarible.com/blindcamel), the Hashbot Genesis NFT perfectly encapsulates what we set out to do when we started Hashflow—to create something new, better, and amazing. It represents the early days of the Hashflow ``experiment” when the protocol was launched in its [Private Alpha](https://twitter.com/hashflownetwork/status/1387799260301770761) phase.\n\nOnly 151 of the Hashbot Genesis NFTs have been minted for Hashflow’s early supporters.\nRight now, not much is known about the Hashbot other than that it’s currently in a top-secret experimental facility in an undisclosed location somewhere deep underground. It’s big, it’s strong, it’s ferocious, and as you can tell, it looks like it wants out!\n\nWhat will happen when the Hashbot is out of its cage? Join the [Hashflow Open Alpha](http://hashflow.com) to find out.",
