    "description": "Introduction: My mantra is to capture Earth’s beauty with my lens and to display it to all humankind.\n\nThe Korea Point of View (K-POV) Collection – as the name implies – encompasses photographs that I have taken while living in the “Land of the Morning Calm”. I’m ecstatic to share different perspectives of Korea with my audience from my camera’s lens POV when I took each photo. I hope that my I audience enjoys the end results of my adventures in Korea as much as I do.  \n\nWhat's the Story Behind the “Ascension” NFT?\n\n“Ascension” is the POV that one gets when they ascend a staircase in the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in Seoul, Korea.  \n•\tArtist: Seoul Man\n•\tDimensions: 5464 x 8192\n•\tLocation: Seoul, Korea\n•\tYear: 2022\n",
