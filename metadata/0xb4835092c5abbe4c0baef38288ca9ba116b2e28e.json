    "description": "Sometimes I draw things from my imagination without even realizing myself that it comes from a place I've been before. Someone will look at the piece and point out something about the colors, the shapes or the subject and then it clicks. Just one different perspective is all it takes and it's amazing how vastly it can change mine about my own art. To my mom with much love and gratitude, thank you. ",
