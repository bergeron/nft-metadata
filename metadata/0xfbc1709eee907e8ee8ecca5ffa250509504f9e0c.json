    "description": "The purpose of my art is to crush my art\n\nThis is my first drawing, which started my creative career. It was created when I first really fell in love, and these feelings were mutual. And even if this relationship has long ceased and more than 12 years have passed, my creativity will remain with me forever.\n\nWith my drawings, I walked more than 1,000 kilometers traveling around the country in the summer of 2012, and did not use money for several months.\n\nThen there were several years of stagnation, when I drew only occasionally, but recently I started to return to my work and realized that what I had drawn before was burdening me. It was a different me. So I decided to destroy my previous work and put the process on the Internet. So I create new art by destroying my old art.\n\nAnd also - I like the sound of tearing paper and the whole process as a whole\n\n8/10/2009",
