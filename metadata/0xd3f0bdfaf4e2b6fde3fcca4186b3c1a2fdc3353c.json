    "description": "“From the depths of an ancient forbidden catacomb, a servant of chaos holds the All-seeing Talisman of the Undead.\n\nThe decorative wooden casket created centuries ago displays the word 'ORIOR' ( I RISE ), a mystic locution that when spoken brings forth the Enchanted One from the fiery pits of the Neverland. So powerful is the giant Skull that it alone can control all remnants of those that came before.\n\nThe floating eye forever searches for enemies of whom possesses the Talisman. Its discoveries are then communicated to the perched wooden Crow, keeper of the voices of all trapped souls within the unholy device.”  \n\n\nSKULL MASTER was created by traditional means, Gouache, WaterColor and Acrylic paint on Cold Press Illustration Paper.\n\nThis piece is a nod to the wonderful, fantastical artwork of the old 1930’s and 40’s pulp covers. The range of Horror, Science, Romance, Crime and Adventure from back in the day of Radio Drama and Pulp Publications has a charm that I hope this piece sparks in those that enjoy nostalgia.",
