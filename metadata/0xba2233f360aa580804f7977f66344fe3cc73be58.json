    "description": "Dissolution Bay is an audiovisual digital art object by Massimo Magee, designed to be read by the computer as both a visual still image and as a piece of audio, these being two readings of the same file. It was made with processed image data and live guitar, shaped across visual and audio domains functionally simultaneously so that a change in the visual also affected the audio and a change in the audio also affected the visual. When you look at the visual reading, you are also seeing all of the audio data. When you listen to the audio reading, you are also hearing all of the visual data. The visual and audio readings were re-combined into a video file for this NFT.\n\nDuration: 15min 33sec.\n\nCreated by Massimo Magee at his studio in London.",
