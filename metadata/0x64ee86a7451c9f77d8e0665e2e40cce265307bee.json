Each door of the houses that have already been vacant has the sticker \"Vacant House.\" I plan to restructure the neighborhood in the crypto world.  \nThe image of the photo is regenerated by a talisman as the colors of the sticker \"Vacant House\" and the talisman are similar. It narrates that the vacant houses send peace to the real world.",
