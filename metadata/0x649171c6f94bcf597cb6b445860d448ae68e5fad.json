    "description": "\"Believe it to see it, little one.\"\n\nGirl's Converse All-Star shoes lifting the tail of the skateboard with heal up/toe down force on the nose, sans child. Mono photography mixed with digital oil painting. 6000 x 4000 pixels.  Work spanned over a few days in May 2022.\n\n25% of the sale goes straight to \"GiveDirectly.org\" via smart contract split - a great charity that is highly functional giving cash directly to families around the world most in need.\n\nThis is my first mint on Foundation - so grateful to be here!\n",
