    "description": "Would you like to travel to another time... \nAt all times man remains human, with his weaknesses, emotions, dreams and hopes. Only the environment, external factors, entourage and scenery change. Everything is changing, transforming and evolving. And everything is interconnected... our past experiences give birth to the future. Without the past there is no future, and without hope for the future the past has no meaning.  \n Art itself is transforming. Our possibilities and our very perception of art change. We live and create, remembering the past and hoping for the future, and all these thoughts come together in a single moment - Now!\n\n",
