    "description": "Echoes of Monk is an inspired derivative based on \"Monk #44\" from Elisey Zhukovsky's \"Transreality\" collection. \n\nMonk's description (below) sent me off to concretize using the latent space in hopes to capture further visual manifestations of this large black house calmly levitating above the landscape.\n\n\"The interdimensional object Monk is a UFO of metamorphic type that takes the form of a large black house. It moves across the sky and disappears without a trace only to reappear later. Eyewitnesses report hearing beautiful unearthly choir voices in their heads as the object approaches. The targets of this object remain unknown.\"\n\nMonk #44: https://foundation.app/@EliseyZhukovsky/trlt/47\n\nEchoes of Monk is the captivating result of those findings, fused together from 60 unique images using the following: interdimensional, large black house, phenomena, monk, monkpunk, transreality, ufo, & even using the full description all together!  ~enjoy\n\nSpecs:\nGIF Rez: 1024x1024 | AR: 1:1 | MJv4\n",
