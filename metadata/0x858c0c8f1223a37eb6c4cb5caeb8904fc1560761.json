    "description": " Edition: 1/1\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n Resolution: 5304x6630\n\nShark Fin Cove holds a special place in my heart. It was here I got the call that my Dad was taking a turn for the worse, when I would fly to New York the next day to see him a few days before he passed from liver cancer, and be with my mother and sister. I wanted him to make it, I honestly thought he would. It was here where I knew nothing would ever be the same, where I would never be the same. \n\nThis shot is about endings and beginnings. The west is where the sun sets, but it must rise again the following day. \n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
