    "description": "Africa has been abandoned. Temperatures have increased and the land is scorched, desolate and plagued with heat-fuelled hallucinations; meaning the humans have departed and creatures are left free to rove the plains of the Serengeti. Somewhere secret, an animal sanctuary is undomesticated, 3000 giraffes have taken over and are thriving without humans.\n\nThe giraffes, aka the Long Neck Cartel, decorated in safari stained hats and often seen smoking tobacco infused pipes, have discovered a concealed world of precious gems. Now the masters of mining, the Long Neck Cartel have come to be the chief distributors of precious gems in the whole of Africa.",
