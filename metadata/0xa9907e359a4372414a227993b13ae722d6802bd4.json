    "description": "Solitude is eternal. Even people with the most company feel it. The mere idea of being alone is intolerable to most. Solitude is when, in your own bubble, or even in the midst of a party, you feel isolated and misunderstood. Solitude is you and me. In that respect, you are not alone. \n\nDigital Art / Collage 2023",
