    "description": "Cable-stayed bridge at Port Nagoya, Japan's busiest container ports. In the background are industrial structures and container ships. Legoland can also be seen at the far end of the bridge. This image is a juxtaposition. It is an ultra long exposure of over 5 minutes which gives the perception of time at a stand-still, allowing the viewer to zoom in and fully partake in silence the activities in this noisy, bustling port. \n\n4000 × 2668\n\nOptional signed archival fine art giclee print is included for the primary collector.\n\nCommercial rights can be negotiated; copyright is retained by the artist.",
