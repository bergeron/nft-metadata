    "description": "In this transformative photographic collage, the question of identity is meticulously dissected, echoing the historical genre of Angels and Demons in artistic interpretation. I am deeply invested in scrutinising the dichotomy between virtue and vice, casting new light on this ancient theme through my photographic lens.\nThe central figure, a nude female donning ethereal angel wings, serves as an embodiment of altruism. The wings serve not merely as adornments, but as symbols of her nurturing spirit, intertwining the divine and the human. This figure becomes an arresting dichotomy, an incarnation of benevolence amidst chaos.\nThe swirling fire, an embodiment of smoke and flames, envelopes her form, representing the poignant struggle of self-sacrifice and the price paid for nurturing the undeserving. This smoky pyre becomes a symbol, reflecting the often futile act of giving to those who exploit generosity, whether in social media, professional life, or personal relationships.",
