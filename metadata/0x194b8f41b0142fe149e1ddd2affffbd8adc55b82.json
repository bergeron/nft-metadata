    "description": "The nft photograph **\"Âmes sœurs\" *(Soulmates)*** created by French art photographer **Ludovic Baron**, was dramatically unveiled on the **Eiffel Tower in May 2022**. This nft is unique and signed in the center of the work.  \n  \nInspired by the famous painting **\"The Romans in Their Decadence\"** by **Thomas Couture (1847)**, the **\"Âmes sœurs\" (Soulmates)** art photograph sends a positive message about inclusion. For his first nft, artist Ludovic Baron photographed many personalities of different morphologies, ethnicities and genders whose self-confidence exemplifies the message that everyone should accept themselves as they are. With many hidden symbols, this nft photo reflects a modern vision of our world and the power of self-acceptance and diversity.\n  \nFor the first sale, a series of gifts will be offered to the buyer. See conditions on the official website **[https://www.ludovicbaron.fr/soulmates-nft-auction](https://www.ludovicbaron.fr/soulmates-nft-auction)**\n",
