    "description": "War is afoot! Centuries of peace have been disturbed. Which side will you choose?   On the planet Alapis 7 Apes and Aliens have lived in harmony together for centuries. However, after a suspicious attack on Parliament, which resulted in the deaths of both Ape and Alien aldermen and women, fear and doubt has spread amongst the citizens of Alapis 7 causing a disruption of the peace and the Apes and Aliens have turned on one another resulting in all out war!   P2E Game: Apes and Aliens are 2x 1000 NFT collections which compete against one another each month in a Trading War - the side with the highest transaction volume on Opensea for the month wins 75% of all royalties made from both the Apes and Alien collections during said month. Winnings are paid out in ETH and airdropped directly to the winning collections holders wallets.   Simply choose a sideâ€¦ (or be a double agent), buy and hold NFTs from that collection(s) to receive monthly passive income.",
