    "name": "Dragon of the mango tree",
    "description": "Dragon of the mango tree is the same color as mango fruit. Some people say it feeds by mangoes. But actually it’s hiding in the mango trees during the hunt. Be careful when you’re going to grab some mangoes, these dragons immediately attack those who have a desire to everything sweet. If you ever see this gorgeous creature and stay alive, it means you are really the lucky one.\n\nThis artwork is a secret hint to one of my collections at another marketplace called \"FIERY TALES\", which was my first collection since I got into NFTs, it illustrates ladies and dragons, and keeps an important message. I use the same characters for both of my collections and tell different stories about them. This way they have their inner world and literally come alive.",
