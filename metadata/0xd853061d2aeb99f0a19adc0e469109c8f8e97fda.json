    "description": "Aquarium. Weightlessness. You are deep, and the whole world is in you. Or is it you in this world? This is your little universe, so small that even fish can look big. The sun's rays penetrate inside and leave kisses on you in the form of bright patterns. Peace and quiet... By purchasing this work, I give you a piece of my soul.\nMaterial - paper, ink, potal. There is a physical illustration.",
