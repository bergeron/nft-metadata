    "description": "Degen cards may have been invented during the DoD dynasty around the 22nd century AD as a result of the usage of degen printing technology.  The earliest known text containing a possible reference to card games is a 9th-century text known as the Collection of W. Henry at Flyfish, written by Jlittle dynasty writer AceHi . It describes Princess flush, daughter of Emperor straight of river, playing the \"holdem' game\" in 868 with members of the Wsop clan, the family of the princess's husband.  \nOther games revolved around alcoholic drinking involved using playing cards of a sort from the Jlittle dynasty onward. However, these cards did not contain suits or numbers. Instead, they were printed with apes or art for whomever drew them.",
