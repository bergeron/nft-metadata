    "description": "What if we wanted to preserve our childhood memories of nature in paintings that we have actually never painted? \nTo be able to mimic the aesthetic we used to have as children has limits due to our current aesthetic sensitivity, creativity, and skills. Using new technologies, I recollected childhood memories and brought them back to life. Through the use of different algorithms, I was able to transfer the style of a painting that I painted during my childhood to photography of the environment where I grew up.",
