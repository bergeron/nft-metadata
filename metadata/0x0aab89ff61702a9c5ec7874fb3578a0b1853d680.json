    "description": "Why help now?\n\nRight now Ukraine is not only fighting for their independence and sovereignty, but also for the right to live in a free democratic society. For years Ukraine was a pain in Russia's side by showing the whole world that human rights and democratic freedoms are more successful over tyranny and totalitarianism. Today the failing tyrant of Russia is playing the last card in his sleeve: a total war. Standing with Ukraine now is standing for peace, justice and basic human dignity and showing the whole world that war and violence will lead nowhere. \n\nWhat happens after the war?\nAfter Ukraine wins I do believe it will change the way people everywhere see how a healthy society and politics function. People of tomorrow will accept mediocrity no longer. The victory of Ukraine will surely signify that a healthier, more caring and loving society is the only way to prevail over terrible injustices Ukraine faced over the centuries.\n\n",
