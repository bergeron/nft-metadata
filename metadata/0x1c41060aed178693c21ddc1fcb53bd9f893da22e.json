    "description": "\"Afeto\", 2020. \n\nPhotography by Rony Hernandes.\n\n3648x5159 jpeg.\n\nHow much do our bodies talk from their fragments? Immersing themself in this questioning, the artist explores possibilities of imagery construction resorting to perspectives, tones and movement.\n\nIf the skin is our best biography, our color, scars or tattoos are marks of a whole that becomes “Fragments of Being”. Thus denominated, this series brings to light particular narratives in shots that emerge from feelings and sentiments originated both from behind and in front of the lens, allowing for a glimpse from outside within the peculiarity of each being, their inner and outer vastnesses.\n\nFragments of Being was minted with sponsorship by Casa NUA, incubating groundbreaking developing world, non English speaking artists to the NFT space.",
