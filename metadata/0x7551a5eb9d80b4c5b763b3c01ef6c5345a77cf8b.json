    "name": "Albert and the old tree",
    "description": "In the center of Howerville Botanical Gardens was an old magical tree. But the only inhabitant who perceived this magic was Albert Remurry, a child who will enter into symbiosis with the tree. \nIn his twenty-fifth year, on a slightly rainy day, Albert was visiting the botanical garden and sat down at the foot of the tree to eat his sandwich. Leaning with his back against the thick trunk of the tree, as soon as he swallowed the last piece of sandwich his senses were amplified and the innumerable magical potential that the tree possessed ran very fast in his mind.\n\nThe rest is legend, I add one last thing, Albert will write it, choosing each time with great skill how to move among the magical folds of the tree.\n\nAI assisted art",
