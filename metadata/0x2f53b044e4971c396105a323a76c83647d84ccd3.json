    "description": "She has contemplated the state the state of the kingdom. Day after day, alone in her chamber. Tears have touched skin, but the time for crying has passed away. Passed away like those who offered their lives in an unyielding war. Passed away like the peace that once rained in the land and her desire to remain obedient. She will leave this kingdom. That decision has been made. She will take matters into her own hands, embark on a journey. She will find a solution. But she is afraid.  \n\nThe collector of this piece will be airdropped two additional pieces that will further expand on the story. The pieces will give more insight into the current state of the kingdom, and why she was compelled to make such a desperate decision.",
