    "description": "An allegory of the creative spirit for the visual artist. Grounded on a rocky planet with manmade technology, spirit is connected with earthly experience. The eye and the camera are optical tools of visual language radiating out into a vacuum of time and space. Skulls, flowers and butterflies represent the transience of nature and human life surrounded by stars, planets and the infinite. She paints in a trance of divine inspiration, the body and mind are a vessel for the heavenly state of unlocked imagination.",
