    "description": "1/1 NFT\n\nPhoto: 9 696 х 6 430 px\n\n\"Lonely traveller\" is a conversation about loneliness, perhaps inspired by my inner state at the time.... originally it was a seascape shot on kodak 400 negative film with beautiful clouds, which inspired certain thoughts of loneliness, later I finished drawing the bottom of the photo in a graphic editor.... a tree, a man, the ground underfoot is a drawing… \n\nWe are all alone, we come into this world alone, and in death we too are alone... no matter how busy the world is around us, no matter how much noise there is around us, we are still alone, no one will ever understand us exactly as we perceive ourselves. No one will ever feel our pain or joy 100%. We are all just lonely travelers...",
