    "description": "This is by far one of my favorite drone shots and one of the closest I've gotten to a bridge thus far!\n\nSo here is the story behind this one shot.\n\nThis drone shot was used in a music video I edited for an artist named NoLoveMonday for his music video \"Didn't Change\" (You can find it on Youtube) or my website (Truth be told, I haven't updated my website in a while so check YouTube, lol).\n\nGet this, I was gifted the drone (mavic mini), and I had to learn how to operate the drone LITERALLY THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOOT LMAO.\n\nHonestly, I thought it was going to be hard at first, but I was able to figure it out within hours.\n\nConsidering the fact that I had to learn this on the fly (no pun intended), I think it's actually a great shot.\n\nMoral of the story, do what you gotta do, to get the job done.",
