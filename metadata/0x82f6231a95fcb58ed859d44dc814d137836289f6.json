    "description": "“Hold me ‘till I go” is a series of portraits depicting 75-year-old Katinka and her battle with cancer, taken in early 2020 between chemotherapy treatments. Katinka was a very close friend of my, and knowing the state of her health, there was a sense of great urgency to capture these moments. It was a time of significant challenges: facing and accepting the most likely and predicted outcome, despite the all-consuming desire to live. \n\nThe portrait won multiple awards, such as 2020 1st Place Single Image LensCulture Journey and 2020 The Independent Photographer Portrait 1st Place, and has been exhibited in New York, Bratislava, Berlin, Barcelona, and Helsinki. \n\n\n",
