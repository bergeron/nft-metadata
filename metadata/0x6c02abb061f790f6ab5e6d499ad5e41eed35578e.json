    "description": "This is our favorite place to sit and have tea in the Garden. A tranquil and calm space to watch the dragonflies over the water and get lost in deep conversation.\n\nMixed Medium:\nIRL references/experiences from our Home Gardens including photographs, film, drawings and paintings expanded upon in co-creation with AI and Digital painting. The colors are a representation of botanical paints and dyes we make from flowers, plants, fungi and clay from the land.\n\nAbout the Collection:\nInto the Garden is an Exploration of Symbiosis between Nature & Technology. We experience in close relationship to working with the soil and Earth how everything is connected - and how even AI ultimately comes from Nature. As we dive deeper into this connection between microbiome, mycillium, soil, natural elements and all life, we have been pulled into the exploration of symbiosis beyond the physical - where creation becomes the creator and Life is infinitely renewed.",
