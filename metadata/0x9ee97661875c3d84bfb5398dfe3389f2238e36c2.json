    "description": "This is the first-ever NFT collection, on any platform, of classic historical photographs taken in Africa.\n\nThis collection comprises 50 photographs taken, on 35mm black & white film, by my grandfather Américo Ferreira in Mozambique, Africa, in the 1960s.\n\nEach person portrayed on this collection, when photographed 6 decades ago on a remote location, wouldn’t envision a digital future. All of them are now transported, through space and time, to the global-stage of cutting-edge blockchain technology - their existence preserved, honoured and (hopefully) celebrated forever.\n\nThese 50 NFTs were created by carefully photographing original darkroom prints with a modern digital medium-format camera - respecting and conserving these photographs including all marks on paper developed with time.\n\n1/1 JPEG 2257 × 3545 pixels\nAll NFT sale proceeds will be spent in Mozambique.",
