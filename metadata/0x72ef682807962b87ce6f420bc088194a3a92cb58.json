    "description": "A photo of Krystal, taken on a brisk, yet sunny day on a high rise in uptown Manhattan, New York.\n\nIt's always a pleasure to find a model that you work with comfortably; for me, that model is Krystal. I've shot with her numerous times over the years because of that connection.\n\nHer look can easily go from sweet and demure to confident and powerful, her use of various hairstyles and wardrobe putting her into character. She becomes a master of her surroundings when shooting, and usually decides for me what the final result will look like.\n\nI just look through the viewfinder and hold on for dear life.",
