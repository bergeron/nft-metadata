    "description": "There's a popular phrase making the rounds lately:  \"Touch grass.\"  \n  \nMost of my travel and leisure time involves a lot more hiking, running, scrambling, and fancy footwork than that phrase implies, but I still love the spirit of it.  Leave behind the electronic tethers that bind you, turn your back on the hustle and bustle of modern society, and connect with what grounds you.  Find a way to let go of your worldly worries, and drift off to dream...  \n  \nI like to think that this man and his best friend were doing exactly that while they rested in the shade of this building.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Artist:**  Steve Walasavage  \n**Series:**  Non-Fungible Travels  \n**Collection:**  Onward  \n**Edition:**  1/1 NFT  \n  \n---  \n  \n*\"Onward\"* is a collection of one-of-a-kind images released, minted, and listed by Steve Walasavage during the 2023 calendar year and beyond.  Consider this my most recent collection, at least until the next one comes along.  \n  \nAll editions are ERC-721 tokens minted on the 'Onward' custom smart contract.  \n  \nExtended Editorial License:  Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
