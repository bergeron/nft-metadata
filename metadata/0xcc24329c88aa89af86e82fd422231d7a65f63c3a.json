    "description": "LAB 01 LOGS ON UNIT RUS-001\n\n[Log 2 – XX.XX.1997] Unit RUS001 was successfully germinated. The DNA’s compatibility is stable and we’re positive we discovered the perfect balance to create life out of the DNA fusion. The next few days will determine if the formula behind so much trial and error has finally brought some progress.\n\n[Log 300 – XX.XX.2007] Viktoria was taken to an Outpost’s 01 High Security Ward. Her brain capabilities are a threat. She has the perfect amount of power but an insufficient amount of emotional control. A precocious psychopath. She’ll still be trained in-cell, a stabilizing chip had to be applied to her brain, there’s no other way to stop her when she loses it. The last power blow she had costed us enough.\n\n[Log 603 – XX.XX.2034] Our Viktoria is about to see the light of day after so many years. She’s the perfect candidate to face The Rebellion, those units don’t stand a chance. Lab 01 is on the run for taking this victory home.\n",
