    "description": "NFT Factory X Pierre Pauze\n\nMDMA.jpeg Editions 12/12\n\n15 Dec 2022 - 15 Jan 2023 Paris\n\n√áa sent le crypto-sapin.\n\nAbout the work:  \nThis is a representation of a sound wave emitted by a molecule of MDMA. \nWTF?  \n In 2018, I have to buy chemical substances  on the darknet with BTC for a project between science & Art, called Please Love Party.  \nAn  experiment about a \"Love Drug Elixir\" on human scale.  \nAfter synthesizing in a laboratory  a powerful psychotropic drug made from chemical components and drugs, we transferred the essential information into water through a wave transmission device linked to controversial theories about water memory.  \nIt is a question, in a way, of digitizing molecular information, of creating a digital drug. \nThe idea of introducing molecules in the digital sphere was like the last symbolic step of the all-digitalization. Biology being the last step from the the meta-perspective of the web3.  \nThis image is one of the digital traces of this experience.  \nMore info here : https://twitter.com/PauzePierre/status/1595133374397829122?s=20&t=CVILWqUuaY6bzPCnTs1sFA",
