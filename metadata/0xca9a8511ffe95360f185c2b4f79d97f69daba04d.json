    "description": "This shot was taken in Holmdel, NJ during the 2009 NIN|JA tour with Jane's Addiction as the co-headliner. During this tour, Nine Inch Nails allowed fans to bring in professional recording equipment, as long as it wasn't disruptive to the audience around you. This made for many great bootlegs and fan-created video projects.\n\nA few days earlier on this tour in Mansfield, MA, I was down in the pit and some very nice professional photographers helped me out with the settings on my camera, as I really had no idea what I was doing. Because of their kindness, I was able to get some great shots during these shows.\n\nThis one was taken just as the blinding white lights were going off during Head Like a Hole and completely drowned out the background.",
