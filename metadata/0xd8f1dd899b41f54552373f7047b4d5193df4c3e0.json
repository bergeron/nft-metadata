Will the famous dancers have performances tonight?\n\n---\n\nThe beats are pumping. No one, really no one stands or sits still anymore. The music is dark, electronic and the bass is so strong that you can feel it in your heart. Shani is on stage, she is the number ONE of the \"Other World\", there is no better pole dancer.  She always has her own outfits at the start and they are just terrific.\n\n---\n\nLAZERGIRLS is a project based on inspiration from Cyberpunk, Shadowrun, electronic music like Laserkraft, and much more. \nDedicated to the neon dancers in nightclubs and holographic projections.",
