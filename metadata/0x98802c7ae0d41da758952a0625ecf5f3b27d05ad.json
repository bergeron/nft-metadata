    "description": "This was the first photo I ever snapped of the colours of Autumn.\n\nI was on a road trip through Oregon in October 2017. The plan was to go on some hikes, get some fun photos and explore areas I had never been to.\n\nI stumbled upon this stunning scene of a waterfall that was framed by fall foliage. Before seeing this with my own eyes, I had no idea Oregon even had fall colours like this. I was blown away by how a scene that is already so beautiful throughout the year could appear even more magical with a slight pop of colour.\n\nFrom this point on, I was hooked and wanted to go photograph this beautiful seasonal event of Mother Nature all around the world.\n\nI've since photographed Autumn in Patagonia, Europe, Canada and the USA... But this tranquil little scene in the Oregonian rainforest will always hold a special place in my heart.",
