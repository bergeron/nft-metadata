    "name": "Nature’s Smoke Signal",
    "description": "In ancient times, smoke signals were used for long distance communication. Over the years with the advent of communication technology, this died a natural death. As per old records, one puff of smoke was meant to call for attention, and three puffs in a line meant a call for help or indication of danger. As we gaze upon the barren beauty of the landscape, it seems as if nature is calling for mankind’s attention to the danger to our delicate ecosystem and seems to voice a call for help to preserve the pristine beauty of our ecology for all fauna, flora, and future generations of homo sapiens!\n\nArtist: Dolly Kabaria\nLocation: Namgyal Tsemo Monastery, Ladakh, India.\nEdition: 1/1\nFormat: JPG\nDimension: 4500 x 3000\n\nLicense: NFT can be used in advertising, private displays and in exhibitions by the NFT holder, as long as the artist is credited.
