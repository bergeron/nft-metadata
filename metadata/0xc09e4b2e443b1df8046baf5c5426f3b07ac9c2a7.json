    "name": "The Red Riding Hood ate the wolf ",
    "description": "Once upon a time, an old woman named Little Red Riding Hood was on her way home, but not on her way to her grandmother's house, because now she was a grandmother herself. Red Riding said to himself on the way home, now that I have done all my important things like I studied, I got married, I raised my children, I earned money and some other things. Now is the time to think. She thought about the role of the wolf in her life. She thought about this wolf that her mother scared her from childhood to this age and she said with herself, I lived with the fear that there is always a wolf outside the house that wants to eat me. But I have not seen any wolf that is similar to my mother's description. I have only seen a wolf once in my life, and that was that summer day when I went to visit my grandmother. I remembered that wolf and I looked at each other for a moment, but that wolf did not eat me. The wolf gave me a motherly look, but my mother's words scared me so much and I attacked the wolf ",
