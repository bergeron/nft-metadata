    "description": "Adom spat out a spurt of teal blood and snarled \"That's the last time we trust a blackmarket Tangle Zipper. That damn thing could have killed us.\" \n\n\n\tChinzera got up to smooth their clothes and shake the wet blades of grass off their hands \"Shh, quiet! Or you'll draw attention.\" \n\n\n\t\"Draw attention? From who, the cows? That Zipper spat us out in the middle of nowhere. We were meant to be in front of a library.\"\n\n\n\t\"Fair point.\" Chinzera raised her arm. A swarming cloud of purple pixels dispersed from a plate on her arm and coalesced into an information display. There was a purple map with a blinking gold dot on it.\n\n\n\t\"Yeah, that piece of junk was off by 7 miles. That's the last time we buy anything from ﻿Dakarai﻿.\"",
