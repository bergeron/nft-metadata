    "description": "VOICES I is about finding moments of relief and escape from your own mind. It's the first segment of a two-part song that was written and produced live on Twitch, and VOICES II will soon follow with another drop on Sound.\n\nPart I was originally created as a new introduction for my debut performance at Red Rocks this year, and the Golden Egg winner will have tickets and backstage access to the show on October 21, 2022 (utility may also be transferred to another show).\n\nLyrics:\nI just wanna drown the voices in my head\nAnd if I play my music louder, maybe I'll feel better",
