    "description": "Cradle Light features two figures - their heads emitting a similar light beam encircled by a halo - moving across space to embrace each other, suggesting that perfect companionship can be found even in the vast universe.\n\nMoreover, just as the light emitting from their heads remains the purest white even as the primary colours of their bodies combine into secondary hues, so too can one hold onto oneâ€™s true self even while forming relationships with others.",
