    "description": "Made while in Tokyo, I was on a trip for a group show. I was very inspired by the city, and all of the art. I have the ability to transmute the energy of my surroundings into my art. I think this piece really exemplifies that, and I don't think I can replicate this style because it was so in the moment. Owner of this token receives the signed print from my solo show in Japan. Legends disturb. Legends get in the way. Legends change the narrative. ",
