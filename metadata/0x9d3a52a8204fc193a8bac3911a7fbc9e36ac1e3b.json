    "description": "One of the 25 most common murders.  \n4500 X 8000 PIXELS = 62,5 X 111 INCHES = 1,60 X 2,80 METERS\n\n¨ I try to generate an aesthetically pleasing  \nvisual impact with an image that would,  \nin its bare form, be disturbing and negative.  \nThe collection is a series of 25 of the most  \ncommon murders. Each piece is composed  \nof a weapons, impacted organ, particles,  \nexplosions and bullets in the case of firearms.  \nI take base images of the different elements  \nand run them through the same transformation  \npattern, and then recompose the piece out  \nof the deconstructed parts ¨.
