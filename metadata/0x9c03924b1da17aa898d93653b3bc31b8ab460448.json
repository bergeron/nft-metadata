    "description": "Is it possible to dissolve in art? How much of ourselves do we give for art or do we lose ourselves in it entirely? How many layers of our personality do we put on one our work? Does the viewer see all our emotions through our works? An infinite number of questions, one answer. \nThe artists' works exist in order for the viewer to be able to find something of his own. The viewer can see in the work what the artist didnâ€™t put into it and this will be exactly what he needs.\nThis is the layering of art. \nAn infinite number of layers.",
