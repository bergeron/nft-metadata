    "description": "A tokenized experiment that utilizes the concept of “ownership as a control mechanism”…  \nBased off a creator & his community, the community holds 90% of the whole tokens for free, while the creator reserves 10% to control the experience from the contract… \n\nIn this case, an arcade game is the experience… The creator turns this game on & off from the contract, which makes the token change from a static state to a dynamic state at random times as the control mechanism… \n\nA single ERC1155 token of 369 editions, controlled by 36.9… \n36.9 rounded off to 37 as 10%…  \nBut when this 10% is reduced by a few strikes through offers-based acquisitions, the control is broken, unlocking both the art & arcade (artcade) for the community to permanently experience…\n\nAn episode from the “artcade” series…",
