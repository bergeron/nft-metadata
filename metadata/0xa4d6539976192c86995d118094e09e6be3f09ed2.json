    "description": "\"Spaces\" is a piece that visualizes a place where people gather to share ideas and connect with one another. Set in a forest, the greenery symbolizes the growth and expansion of these communities, reminding us of the endless possibilities for connection and knowledge sharing. The circle of people sitting together symbolizes the unity and inclusiveness that are at the core of these communities. Expressing the idea that, even though we may be physically separated, we can come together in these virtual circles to create meaningful connections and share our thoughts with one another",
