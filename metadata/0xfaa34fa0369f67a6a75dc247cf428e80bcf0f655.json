This collection serves as a living album, a journal from which the fruits of experimentation in genre, composition, and production find home. When a spark of inspiration hits or a set of works don't form an album of their own, the lab that is the Endless Experiment welcomes in the vagabond tracks.\n\n\nGrant of Rights, Limitations, and Warranties:  \n1.\tThe Copyright Owner of the Works remains the copyright owner.
