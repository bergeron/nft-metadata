    "description": "Mint alone is simply too bitter for me. Chocolate with a wonderful creamy mint filling, on the other hand, is my absolute favourite delicacy â€“ best served ice cold from the fridge and the whole pack at once. In the shape of a heart, of course, because we should all have a big heart for each other. That's why this tongue-in-cheek persiflage is of course just as free as \"The Free Mint\", which inspired me to make this. Enjoy it!",
