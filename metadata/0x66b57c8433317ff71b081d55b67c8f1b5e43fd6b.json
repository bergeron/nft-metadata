    "description": "\"Ever-Changing\" - Sandwich Harbour, where massive sand dunes meet the ocean. It’s a forever changing landscape as the dunes can move and shift with the wind. Where they go is in mother natures hands. It’s a beautiful reminder that nothing in life stays exactly the same forever. As humans we are constantly learning new things, changing, adapting, growing and aging. Change is often scary, uncomfortable and anxiety inducing but on the flip side there is so much beauty, excitement and growth in the discomfort of change. Sometimes we just need to have a little faith and trust that the wind will shift us to where we need to go next. \n\nThe collector will have the option to receive a physical print of the image alongside the NFT. The size of the print will be determined by the collector and Mel once the sale is complete.",
