    "description": "Description of sacred paintings\n‚ôædivine talisman‚ôæ\n\nThis work is like a powerful amulet üßø, because it is based on the sacred symbol \"hamsa\", which symbolizes protection from evil forces and good disposition.\nLotus flower attracts a lot of attention. And it's not just like that! Lotus is a symbol of spiritual growth and the ability of the soul to achieve perfection. And this is what I am going to now and many are striving for ‚ù§Ô∏è\nThe seed of life attracts attention with its light, the light of 7 days of creation, the beginning of life, a great creation. This symbol is present in my entire collection, as a sign of warmth and a great start üí´\nAt the bottom at the base you can observe the moon. In my case, it means femininity and intuition.\nAnd the last thing you can see is the pyramids, versatility, striving upwards.\n\nHaving this Art you will feel safe and on the right track üí´",
