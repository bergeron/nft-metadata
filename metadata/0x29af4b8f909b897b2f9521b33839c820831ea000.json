    "name": "Snow meeting in the forest",
    "description": "It was snowing. Large snowflakes fell in magical flakes, and the branches of the trees swayed in time with the cold and slightly scorching wind. Tiara gently took Mira by the shoulder, tilting her head towards her\n- What is it? -she fluttered her eyelashes in amazement, on which drops of water trembled \nMira smiled mysteriously, shaking her shaggy bangs and raising her folded palms to herself \n-It's a snow globe, but look, there's a little tenant inside. It's a deer, see? Just like you..\nTiara, as if fascinated, looked at the small slender figure who studied her through the glass of the ball, inside of which snow was falling, right on their heads with Mira. \n-We're not leaving her here, are we?-she asked anxiously, excitedly raising her graceful hooves in the air \n- Of course not!  Mira replied. - This snow meeting is our Christmas miracle.. And miracles are fate",
