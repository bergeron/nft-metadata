    "description": "Once upon a time, the crow was white and the peacock was pale yellow. They were invited to attend Lord Tiger’s wedding and they thought about decorating themselves. They stole the paint from the workman who built the king’s house.\n\nPeacock insisted that crow painted him first, so crow covered his breast in beautiful blue and green, and covered his tail in intricate designs. Peacock was so proud of the beautiful way he looked and decided he did not want crow to share his beautiful colors. Instead he called out a warning to crow that eagle was coming and pretended to run away. He accidentally knocked all the paint into the river.\n\nCrow looked into the sky and did not see eagle. He told peacock that everything was alright and asked how he could paint him now that all the paint was in the river. Peacock produced a single paint and assured him that everything would be alright. Crow let him paint him without realizing that it was jet black. When crow saw his reflection in the river, he realized that he had been deceived. He let out a scream of anger but it stuck in his throat. That is why crows are now black and can only utter a hoarse cry.\n\nTHE ARTIST\n\nHendro Soetrisno is an international award-winning photographer. He is a Master of Photography from PPA, a Master Photographer in Fine Art - Accredited in Fine Art Nature from MPI, and a Master of WPPI. He represented the United States in the World Photographic Cup and brought home the gold medal in the Nature category and the Best of Nations award. He has won more than 150 prestigious awards from reputable organizations worldwide including Professional Photographer of America, Wedding and Portrait Photographers International, Master Photographers International, and Australian Institute of Professional Photography. He also held several Photographer of the Year titles from various professional organizations.\n\nHendro is a visual storyteller. His fine art images are part of his imagination, where the color of the water is sometimes pink instead of blue, where birds and other animals speak to him when he speaks to them.\n\nEach of his work is a result of more than 25 years of photography, thousands of captures, endless waiting for a single perfect moment followed by months of post production to bring his world of imagination to life.\n\nHe started his photography using a medium format film before switching to digital. He was a landscape photographer at the beginning but then his interest expanded to include wedding and portrait photography before settling down in fine art nature.\n\nUpon a suggestion of a friend, he entered his first professional competition in AIPP (Australia Institute of Professional Photography) where he got his first awards. He continued entering other major professional competitions, among them were Wedding and Portrait Photographers International (WPPI), Professional Photographers of America (PPA), and Master Photographers International (MPI). Not only were those competitions judged by the world's best photographers, he had to compete against them as well and all these have been contributing to his learning progress. He has won at least 150 awards and earned several Photographer of the Year titles from different organizations.\n\nAs an acknowledgement, he also earned Master degrees from PPA, MPI, and WPPI. He is an accredited fine art nature photographer in MPI. These are not academic degrees but accumulation of achievements from each prestigious competition.\n\nUpon rigorous selection, he was chosen to represent the United States in the prestigious World Photographic Cup - the Olympics of professional photography. He brought home the gold medal in the Nature category and also won the Best of Nations award.\n\nApart from competitions, he also mentored some fellow photographers.\n\nThe event that brought him to his current style was actually a casual conversation with one of the most reputable wedding photographers. He attended his workshop and during a break he told him that he needed to be his own, not just a copy of the photographer. There are a lot of talented photographers and he has to have something that distinguishes his work from theirs. Something that can be recognized as his. He does not want to be a nature photographer. He prefers being a visual storyteller who uses animal fine art to tell his imagination.\n\nHe entered the NFT world in mid January 2022. His first series \"VIVID\" which consisted of 10 images of edition of 1 were sold out in a month.\n\nHe run the collective Artists United. Their first project \"TOGETHER\" was the very first in the history of the NFT photography collective to be curated by a collector with a buy-back guarantee. It was sold out in 3 days.\n\nTHE LICENSE\n\nExtended Editorial: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
