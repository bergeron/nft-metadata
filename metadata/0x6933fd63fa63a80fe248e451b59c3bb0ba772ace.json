    "description": "My work is channeled through abstract art. I try to flow with the combination of water and acrylic, finding shapes and languages. In this collection I aim to illustrate the Andean Cosmovision through my work. My work starts from the Hanan Pacha (Birds) and flowing into the other verticals of the Andean Cosmovision, such as the Kay Pacha (Snakes) and Uku Pacha (Pumas). In conjunction with my own ideas, experiences and knowledge these figures take shape into the Birds Collection. Artist: AFROSKY. NFT under Q'ORI Project digital ownership assignment.
