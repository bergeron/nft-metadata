    "description": "\"Oh my world, we've become closer. I rise above. Why so much pain?\"\n\nThe work was written on the basis of the stories of the doctor of the psychiatric department. \nFaces of people are erased. People are like living corpses outwardly, but inside they remain alive. Everyone has their own world, their own truth, their own history and reality. They all strive for the light, but the process of recovery is always difficult. Reality is terrible. Nobody wants to see her. Nobody wants to see themselves in the real world. Around the ward, bars, nurses in gowns and pills. Lots of pills.\n\nOriginal made with acrylics on canvas. Size 35*50",
