    "description": "Captain Hashtag was on a dangerous mission in deep space when his ship was suddenly ripped out of hyperspace for unexplained reasons and stranded on an unknown planet away from the fringe colonies. The planet was rocky and eerie - with no signs of life. With no hope of rescue, he had to survive on this planet. He began to use the wreck's limited resources to build a functional base to fuel his life support systems and generate food. The days were endless and lonely. The captain spent many hours gazing up at the starry sky remembering his lost home. But even in this hopeless situation, Hashtag did not give up. He built more machines and technology that helped him overcome the challenges on the planet he had come to call \"Destiny\". How will Hashtag's story continue ... is there still hope?",
