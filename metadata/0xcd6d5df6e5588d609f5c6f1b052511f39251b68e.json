When looking far away, you will see a cat's head. But if you look closely, you will see two cats facing each other.\n\nMoreover, This artwork is created with many cat shapes and forms combined with musical elements by creating piece by piece and then joining them together to complete artwork to communicate an atmosphere of mystery and the hiding of ghost cats.",
