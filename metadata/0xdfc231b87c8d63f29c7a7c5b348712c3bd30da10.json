    "description": "\"Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight\nLove, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined\nSo clear as in no face with more delight.\nBut O, as to embrace me she inclined,\nI waked, she fled, and day brought back my night.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ivory Tower consists of a story series of solitude. The solitary figures have scars on their bodies which are the marks of previous existences. The darkness of the forest full of eerie spirits of other worlds is their safe haven which they fled to endure much longer. Ultimately, the stories of Ivory Tower are unsettlingly depictions of the irrationality of the life.\n\n2022\nDigital Drawing\n2500x3000px\n\n",
