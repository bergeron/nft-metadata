    "description": "Juxtaposing a glitch art piece by Jay Delay entitled Blocked User https://knownorigin.io/gallery/135300-blocked-user with a Wikipedia image of the UN Secretariat Building, United Glitched Nations was originally an untitled image included in the double-tweet shown below: “A big diff btwn now and the creative revival of the 60s - 80s is today we blv more in the power of big biz, less in ourselves. We've been convinced we're stupid, obsolete, replaceable. Artists by nature will never believe this. We can't. In order to produce compete and survive.” https://twitter.com/voxeliving/status/1630773344936050688 “Here the United Nations (icon of modern hypocritical civilization, and a horribly boring bldg) is vs. a glitch piece by @Jay_Delay. The piece represents the awesome, unpredictable, and frightening power of art. It always was, and will always be a conflict.” https://twitter.com/voxeliving/status/1630775871303761922 Jay Delay responded to the first tweet with Wen Mint? https://twitter.com/Jay_Delay/status/1630776763335811072 I now had my mission. United Glitched Nations would be made available to the people. This was a historical moment for me as an Artist, and the tweet + response was ripe for minting, as well as the art. I included the 1st tweet + Jay Delay's response in the minted tweet. So at the end of the day I have THREE NFTs (witness my inner-Robness) to offer yall from the United Glitched Nations series: The Tweet (1/1); Separate But Equal (10); and Glitchetariat (unlimited Open Edition). Since the U.N. Secretariat Building was started in 1948 (completed in 1951), I thought it'd be cool to use variations of that number for the NFT prices. Enjoy United Glitched Nations!",
