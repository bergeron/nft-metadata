    "description": "When I create my works I always use my memories and the feelings and emotions they bring me.\nWaves are one of the most fascinating phenomena created by nature, I think each of us had a moment in life when we just froze for a moment and could not take our eyes off of them.\nAt different times of the day waves look very different, each time getting new shades, depending on the environment, the intensity of sunlight and weather. They can be calm or turbulent, or even just ripples on the water.\nWe have no control over their color or behavior, all we can do is look at them.\nI hope this work will help you dive into your memories and recall those beautiful moments.\n\nThere are 4 works in this collection.\nTwo limited edition pieces for collectors of one of my [last drop on Nifty](https://www.niftygateway.com/collections/probability), one open edition piece.\nAnd the final piece, it will be published a week after the end of sales and will be a $1 drawing for those who purchased Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 from this drop.\nMade in p5js.\n\nChapter 1, 2 and 3 - 5550x5950\n\nFinal - 12700x8100",
