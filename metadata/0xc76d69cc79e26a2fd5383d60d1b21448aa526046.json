    "description": "I've always had problems writing elaborate text, loud creative titles, using beautiful turns of phrase or defining manifestos, which are a necessity for a modern visual artist. Therefore, I will do as I have always done: in this series I will try to express my emotions with the help of visual art. Anger / Hatred / Pain / Pride for one's country / and of course Hope. That's what I have been experiencing under constant shelling for almost 2 months now, and what my homeland lives through today. And surely I'll try not to forget about humor in these dark days, at least for now.)\n\nSo everyone is welcome. I hope you'll have a little room in your heart for my art.\n\n\n\n\"AIR RAID ALERT\"\n\nMy feelings and emotions in 30 seconds at 30fps / 192kbps. \nMP4 1280x1600.\n",
