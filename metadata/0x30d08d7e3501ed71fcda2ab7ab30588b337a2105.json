    "description": "Series ‘Viajes del pasado y del futuro’ - Journeys of the past and the future\n1 of 1\n\n‘Maybe there is a possibility in another dimension where we have to go down to go back up’\n\nIn a contradictory analogy of ‘going down to go up’, this piece dialogues with space, going from the bi to the tri dimension  in search of a utopian opportunity in the universe of imagined cities.\nLike the cities we inhabit, it tries to have an order but it is corrupted by the erratic path that is made over it. \nThese stairs are intertwined looking for those possible interstices or spatial voids where opportunities, chaos or nothingness can be found.\n\n▼\n\nArtwork by Victoria Poirier, 2022\n",
