    "description": "''Raise, my friend.''  \nThe necromancer's voice echoed as a skeleton with a steel mask covering half his face rose up to its feet. A peculiar looking squirrel was climbing up his ribcage, with fire in it's eyes. Johnnys' mischievous companion in life and now in death too.  \n''And from now on, you are Johnny Steelpunk.''\n\n* Hand-painted digitally.  \n* Animated using After Effcets.  \n* This artwork is one of the winners of Wes Henry's skull art competitions in November 2022.",
