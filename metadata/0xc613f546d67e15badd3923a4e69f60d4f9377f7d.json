    "description": "70 x 100cm. Mixed Media on Canvas. 2021\n\n\nA Collection of Destroyed Paintings. None of the Paintings in the Collection exist in physical form as they have been destroyed to only live on the blockchain.\n\nEach stroke Orsler puts onto the canvas is an intense spontaneous physical act; Using manual techniques such as layering and scraping. She sees layering as re-writing and hiding her experiences. In comparison, to scraping back the paint, to reveal what was underneath. For Orsler, this is an acknowledgement of what she has gone through to create the works on canvas. In these paintings, her life emerges through a complex layering of paints.\n\nDimensions: 6000 x 4188",
