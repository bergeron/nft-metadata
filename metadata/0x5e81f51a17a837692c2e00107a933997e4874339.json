    "description": "\"Last Travel\" tells the story of a difficult life, full of setbacks, heartbreak but also happiness.\nAs in the most difficult moments our deepest self allows us to fight against all adversity.\n\nPhoto taken on my last trip to LA. Walking the streets of this magical but at the same time raw city, I realized that traveling is what has most filled my thirst for creativity in these years.\nEach location, each moment of the day and each space has something special that makes it unrepeatable.\n\n1/1 piece\n\nCamera: Canon 5D MK IV. ||  Lens: Sigma 35mm \n4306 x 2871 px || 14mb || .jpg\nCollector can claim a signed A5 physical print.\n\nMinted in February 2022 by @Sr_Zeta.\n\nCarlos Mar√≠n.",
