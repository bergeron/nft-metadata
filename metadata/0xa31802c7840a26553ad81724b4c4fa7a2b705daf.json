    "description": "Ring Dance\n\nThe painting of Ring Dance from The Monster collection - which the video is based on- was first created with the technique of oil painting on cardboard in 2020.\n_________________\nProject setting : 24 f/s , 1080*1080 , 00:10 , 13.60mb \nSoftwares : photoshop , moho \n_________________\n\n\n\n\n\"Div or dev (Dīv: دیو) are monstrous creatures within the Middle Eastern lore. Most of their depictions derive from Persian mythology. ...\"\n\nDivs as an important part of fictional creatures in Iranian literature, art, and culture always have outstood. These effects and the constant presence have made them everlasting in our minds.\nAs I read old stories and Iranian myths, I've come to see the wide variety of ways in which these monsters and humans coexist and interact with each other. So, in this collection before you, I've taken inspiration from these tales and used my modern mindset to portray this coexistence and their familiar and sometimes outlandish \ninteraction.\n",
