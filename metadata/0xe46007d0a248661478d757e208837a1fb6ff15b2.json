    "description": "In Nigeria, there's a lot of moral stigma that goes along with being a smoker. It is not my hope to comment on that moral question through this picture, but rather a commentary on our culture of dependence when compared to our choices. \n\nWe are told through a Yoruba proverb that character is like smoke. There is no smoke without a fire and there's much to be known of a man just by observing his choices and how well or badly those choices impact on his life and those of people around him. We are reminded that each man owns his choices - and the consequences thereof - afterall. I thus present this man as a representation of us all - diverse humans with respective agencies and individual stories broken down into chapters marked by many trivial and important choices.",
