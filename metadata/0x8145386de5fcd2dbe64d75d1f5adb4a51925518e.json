    "description": "The ancients believed that the universe is made up of four main elements: fire, earth, water, and air. These four elements can be used to conserve people, nature, animals, etc., according to them.\nIn the meantime, modern people are changing their minds completely and they are more inclined to believe in themselves and their artificial inventions than in nature, which provides them with their most essential needs.\nAfter all these modern people's misbehaviors about the main ancient beliefs, the four elements, sadly have decided to leave the world and all its people. And now, Tierra the Earth is leaving her beloved people who have bothered her a lot.",
