    "description": "Happy Accidents is a satirical view or  meme on a similar quote by one of my favorite artist Mr. Ross.\n\nWatching him paint would always put me Zen-like meditative state that made me receive only the good vibes, and I believe thousands of people felt the same. I think if he were still with us, he would have big laugh seeing this meme. \n\nPart of profits will be donated to Artist Foundation.\n\nThank you.",
