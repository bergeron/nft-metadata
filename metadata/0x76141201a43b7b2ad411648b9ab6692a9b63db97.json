    "name": "Evening Mist",
    "description": "Autumn night on the coast of Finland. Looking back on this beautiful night, I captured one of my favorite photographs of this shipwreck. The colder weather made mist arise from the sea. The thick fog caused the ship to look like it was floating in space. The light from the left side of the photograph comes from a nearby factory. Moon was slightly visible through the mist. All this created a surreal moment in time.\n\nThe ship half-sunken, barely on the water's surface, with few rocks keeping it stand in this place. Once I captured this photograph, I couldn't believe itâ€”a dream shot. The boat has now been fixed, roaming the seas once again, hopefully never returning to this location. \n\nLocation: Porvoo, Finland\nSize: 8200 x 6150\nCapture date: 1st of August, 2013",
