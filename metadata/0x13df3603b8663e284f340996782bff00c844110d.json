    "description": "“Fragmented” is a series inspired by a plate from my wife's late mother, Barbara. It broke in late 2020 and sat on our kitchen island for a few months because. I started to think about stories that could be told beyond the borders of the broken piece.\n\nI moved the fragment to my studio where it stayed on an empty sheet of paper for weeks.\n\nOne day, I picked up a pen and started working on \"Fragmented\", exploring the possibilities of things broken and the stories that can evolve from them.",
