    "description": "To Admit No Evil is to take no accountability for your mistakes or wrongdoings that you might have committed in the past. You never know how your admission of guilt for past misdeeds can be used to unfairly persecute you. One has to be mindful of what they are willing to take responsibility for.\n\nThe Wise Woman in this artwork has her back towards the viewer, with her luscious locks cascading down her back and her coloured hands folded behind her head. She seems to be caught in a compromised position, where she is being made to take account of her actions and justify her intentions behind them. However, the Wise Woman is shrouded in mystery as we cannot see who she is and hence cannot make her admit to anything that she does not want to. Even with her hands behind her, she is the one in controlâ€¦\n\nThis artwork is a limited edition of 25.",
