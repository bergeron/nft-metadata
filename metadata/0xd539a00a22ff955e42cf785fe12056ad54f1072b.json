    "description": "There are times when love is fleeting. So fleeting that it may be forgotten the next morning. \n\nA glance, a touch, a tender embrace. Breaths colliding, heartbeats harmonising, caught in each other's gravity. \n\nSometimes that's all it takes to warm the night away. \n\n---\n\n\nThis piece is derived from my 5th single [Seethala Yahana](https://youtu.be/-U18X8K7yLs), which in my native tongue of Sinhala means \"beds that are cold\".
