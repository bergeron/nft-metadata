    "description": "„Reappearance”, 2021\n\n1/1 NFT\n\nThis work is a part of an ongoing oil painting series in which I try to capture the time and connection between present and the past. \nHaving in front of me blurred images on canvases (like old, unclear memories) I touch them with my hands and allow myself to put on them the emotions and energy accompanying me. This is symbolised by the impasto and clear traces of paint.  \n\nSince my childhood, I have been very sensitive, I have been afraid of passing and I have undertaken philosophical reflections on important subjects. My works are an attempt to do the theoretically impossible - to change the past, to deform it, to adapt it by literally touching the canvas - a carrier of information and symbols.",
