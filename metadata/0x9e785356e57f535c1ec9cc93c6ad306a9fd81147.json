    "description": "“We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.” Over 150 years ago, the African savannah was home to over a million black and white rhinos. The numbers were dangerously dropping. They have slightly improved now as a result of combined conservation efforts of government, NGOs, and private communities. The horns of the rhinos are in high demand as a symbol of wealth and prosperity in some cultures and for traditional medicines - the very reasons for rhino poaching. The other most common reason for hunting was for recreational purposes. This image is about hope to save these beautiful rhinos from extinction. That is also the theme of my series - Life - to live and let live and cohabit and co-exist in harmony.",
