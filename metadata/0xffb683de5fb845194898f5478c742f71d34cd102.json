    "description": "The Hooded Tiger is a vigilante hacker. He would follow anyone who was found connected to racist xenophobia and then mercilessly hacks them to find out what was being concealed underneath their cape. None of them were spared; he shot quickly and expertly. Nobody could stand in the way of this young hero as they wandered through the dark perils of the misinformation in search of fear, bloodshed, and riches.\n\nOnly one will be sold as my NFT debut. Contact me after purchase for the high-resolution 300 dpi version, too large to host on the site, but large enough to print a wall covering with.\n\nMotivate yourself every day with pure strength looking into your soul.",
