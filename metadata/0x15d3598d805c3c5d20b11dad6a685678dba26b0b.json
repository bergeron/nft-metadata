    "name": "If A Rose Could Reflect On The Human Gaze",
    "description": "Over hundreds of years, humans have cultivated roses to have more desirable patterns, better scents, more saturated colors, and even a more graceful death. By asking the rose what it experiences from its revered cultural position, I want to further understand how roses are using human desire to evolve and procreate, and to what extent we are entranced into performing their desires.\n\nIf A Rose Could Reflect On The Human Gaze is an animated portrait using video footage, 2D shapes, and scanned photographs. Part of a larger series titled The Sextant of the Rose, which formally combines animated video with sculptural elements, and includes materials like live roses.\n\nPreviously exhibited at:\nKnockdown Center, Queens, NY, 2020 \nOther Places Art Fair, Los Angeles, CA, 2020\nVox Populi, Philadelphia, PA, 2021\nSPACE, Portland, Maine, 2022\n\n2700 x 2700 \n9 seconds\n16 bit mp4\n\nDakota Gearhart, 2022\n",
