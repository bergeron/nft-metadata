    "description": "Do you see the love of the wave to the moon?!🥺\n I was sitting by the sea on a summer night and the waves hit the rocks of the pier.\n My eyes fell on the moon and at that moment I was immersed in the combination of the image of the moon and the waves.\n It was as if the wave was trying its best to show itself to the moon. \nThe feeling I have for the moon cannot be described.\nBut I know that looking at the moon gives me a sense of security. I look at the sky every night hoping to see the moon. And this interest caused the creation of these works. Also interested in Van Gogh's style, especially the starry night painting.\n\n Information: \n\n🔸Combination and contrast in the cold color of the wave and the warm color of the moon. \n🔸 in the post-impressionist style (style of Van Gogh's works)\n🔸 Physical effect made with acrylic material and motioned. \n🔸Dimensions: 714 x 1080 pixels \n🔸By Sahar Rafiei\n🔸In January 2022",
