    "description": "ðŸŒ¼ R U S T I C ðŸŒ¼\n\nI am all about, renew, reuse, recycle. I created this piece with materials I found at home. The head piece was created out of a bottle, old denim jeans, and news papers. And the outfit was up cycled from an old sweater.\nIn my head, Art is just what art is.\nArt doesn't have to be understood, or perfect, that is why it is Art.\nWhen I create, I would always love my art to mirror me, it should be beautiful, have a personality, and of course be a vibe, and it should still have the quality of being art.\nIn this project, I am exploring recyclable materials as Art works, because why not.\n",
