    "description": "The braided rivers of New Zealand are one of many art forms that Mother Nature has perfected since the beginning of time.\n\nAs the glaciers clinging to the sides of mountains and the blankets of snow dressing the peaks begin to melt, intricate rivers are carved into the sand, flowing and intertwining across the landscape. These vibrant  'Veins of the Earth' pump life through the valleys as they cascade throughout the land to be swallowed up by the sea.\n\nNatural wonders like this are one of the many reasons why we should stop at nothing to protect the beautiful planet we call home.\n\n\nVeins of the Earth by Brayden Hall",
