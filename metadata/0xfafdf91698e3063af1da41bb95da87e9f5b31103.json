    "description": "Nowadays in different parts of the world people can’t express their opinion. In some places you can’t say what you think about politics, in some you can’t speak your mind because of the exaggerated and escalating tolerance movements. People go to jail or become bullied because of their views on life. So what if they are silly sometimes. Live shows are being cancelled, the comedians are being kicked out of the country, politicians are going to jail for false accusations, the non-governmental news are being harassed and end up closed. And even the ordinary people, if they have a strong unpopular opinion, suffer from it and have their lives ruined.\nThinking about all this I created a collection of characters that illustrate this problem. A hand grenade in the mouth of each character is a symbol of inability to speak up. You open your mouth and BANG… All of them are socially different, each has a unique character and style, but all of them are based on my NOHEROES guy.\n",
