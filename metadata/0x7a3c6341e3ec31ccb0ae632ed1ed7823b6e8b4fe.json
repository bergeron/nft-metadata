Thousands of building have collapsed, many people have lost their lives, and many more are still missing. As a Turkish artist feeling desperate I want to help the victims the only way I know how. \n\nThe following work of art represent all the city names that are affected by this devastating earthquake, it's a limitless supply collection that you can buy as many as you like for 0.0074, and all proceeds will be donated to @ahbap 100% to help the victims.",
