    "description": "The sterilization of plants, animals and traditions all over the world as a direct result of man made pesticides and genetically engineered monocultures. Apathy and complacency is normalized in the presence of suffering, and many on earth other than humans do not stand a chance of finding balance in their lifetime. I imagine they dream of what that would feel like. Depicted in this piece are creatures from air, land and sea maneuvering through the rubble and seeking out balance. 2022\n\n",
