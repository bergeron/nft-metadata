    "description": "Michael Littig (b. 1983)  \nWelcome Home: The Living Room, 2018  \nCripple Creek, VA, USA  \nVideo, audio, photogammetry. \n\nWelcome Home is an audiovisual multi-platform collaboration exploring the nature of “Home”. \n\nIn 2018, after the loss of his mother, Michael Littig, in collaboration with multi-disciplinary artist Myles Sciotto, created the first installment.\n\nInterweaving recorded interviews and computer analyzed photogrammetry data from Michael’s family home, the piece explores the question - Can memory, architecture, and music help us remember the forms of home?  \n\nWhat emerges are four digital portraits in the field of archimusic -  the trans-disciplinary territory between architecture and music.  Utilizing spatiotemporal sampling, each portrait investigates the relationship between memory, sound, and space - emphasizing the capability for music and technology to explore home in a way that can be both seen and heard together.  \n\nIn commemoration of the age of his Mother's passing, the artist has chosen to create 64 editions across the entire collection. \n\n“That people could come into the world in a place they could not at first even name and had never known before; and that out of a nameless … call it HOME, and put roots there and love others there; so that whenever they left this place they would sing homesick songs about it and write poems yearning for it like a lover…” (Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of Space)",
