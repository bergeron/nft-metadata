    "name": "In Between Dreams",
    "description": "This acrylic-painted self portrait depicts living a world you don’t feel at home in. I’ve always had deeply vivid dreams that I sometimes conflate with the real world. Some may say my head is in the cloud or that I’m spacey. Life often feels liminal- like I’m living In Between Dreams.",
