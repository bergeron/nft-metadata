    "description": "Each day I paint the date to commemorate another 1440 minutes of life. Today marks the first day I've painted a portrait of the day, then animated it. Today. January 15, 2022 is Timepoet Portrait 1.\n\nToday:\nIt's rainy in LA. Eve and Joan are dead and I miss them. I hear their voice telling me to focus and write. I haven't had sugar since Monday. I am going insane. All day long I thought about going out for a walk but the gloom faded in and out too quickly to ever be successful. I found myself in pajamas until 3 when I went to the post office to mail paintings to Ali in Canada, but they had run out of customs forms. Failed diplomacy. I wound up wandering around Gelsons, mouth foaming for carbs. I restrained myself and ordered an iced espresso, which was revealed to me as a large cup of ice with 1 shot of espresso. I sat in my car and shook that shot until it foamed then swigged it in one gulp. The whole day felt like that failed iced espresso.  So I made my first NFT. \n",
