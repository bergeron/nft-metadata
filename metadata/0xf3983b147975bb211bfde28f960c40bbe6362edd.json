    "description": "Casablanca, a night walk through the city and a complete introduction to the atmosphere. There is a little life going on on every corner. So kind and friendly people are very difficult to perceive in such a poor place, but it happens. It is episodes like this that give a very good insight into \"other lives.\"\n\nThat night I just gave myself to the flow. I went where no ordinary traveler should go. It was dangerous in places, but each time that danger turned into incredible kindness. How you treat the world is how the world treats you.\n\nLook at this shot from that evening and take it in slowly. I assure you, there is probably more life in these picture than there is in huge metropolitan cities. ",
