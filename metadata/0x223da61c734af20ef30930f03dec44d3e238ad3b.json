    "description": "I created \"Breathe\" out of simply being tired. \n\nBeing a twin dad while pursuing a career as a DIY artist can be stressful, and at times feel hopeless.\n\nBy creating \"Breathe\", i was able to in a sense \"breathe again\" through being vulnerable + remembering that it will all come in time.\n\nWritten, Recorded + Mixed by Nessy the Rilla\nProduced by Noane\nRecorded At The Pharmacy Studios - Houston, TX",
