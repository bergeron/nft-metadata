    "description": "A very cold night of autumn (actually Halloween night!), far from city lights, close to nature, being mesmerised by haunting northern lights, shining stars and galactic appearances.\n\nThis piece resumes my curiosity for life for 44 years. And I wanted to celebrate that!\n\nTitle: Starstruck  \nArtist: IKERTJE  \nEdition: Limited to 15  \nCollection name: Editions by IKERTJE  \nResolution: 6000 × 4000 @ 300 dpi (24 Mpix) \n\nWeb: https://linktr.ee/IKERTJE\n\nBio: My name is Iker (Basque Country), living in The Netherlands. Professionally a designer, photography is a very natural organic extension to my body of work, since more than 20 years ago. I believe I've a specific style and point of view, coming from the perspective of design, translated into my photo pieces. I decided my artistic name to be Ikertje (little Iker in Dutch), because of my respect and empathy to the professional photographers and their work, entering their space with a humble attitude.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
