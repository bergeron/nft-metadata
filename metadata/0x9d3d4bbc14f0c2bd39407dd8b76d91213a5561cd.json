Known as C/2022 E3 (Z.T.F.), the comet will make its closest approach to earth on 2nd of Feb 2023. \n\nAccording to the NYT, the comet is likely to be faintly visible to the naked eye from the Northern Hemisphere. But you don't have to wait till 2nd of Feb to spot this visitor. In fact, the new moon (with darker skies) this past weekend might have been more favorable to view it. \n\nDid you spot Comet Pepe?  \nAre you gonna try and hunt the night skies for Comet Pepe?",
