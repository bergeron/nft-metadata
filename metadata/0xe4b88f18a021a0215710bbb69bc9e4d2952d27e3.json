    "description": "MORPH I / The Morph Series is inspired by the natural fractal occurrences in the world.\n\nEach piece is unique and uses varied mathematical equations, in order to generate a different infinity form, reflecting the Mandelbulb geometry.\n\nThe Mandelbulb is a mythical form, that is greatly abundant in nature on a macro and micro scale. It is the main inspiration behind the series, a perfect balance and blend between pure math, art, and nature.",
