    "description": "'Inner Child' is a curated abstract generative art project embracing a creator who everyone knows. A creator who is not constricted by rules. Has no bounds. Colours outside the lines, heck, even colours outside the canvas. A creator who many recognize when it's a bit too late and for those who do so early, keep him close all through life's fickleness. This is the Inner Child.\n\nProgrammed using p5js",
