    "description": "People traverse great distances, crossing rivers, hills, valleys and forests, in search of a livelihood. It has been so since the very primordial periods of existence of human kind. Away from family, away from friends, away from familiar faces, hiding all the strife and the incessant urge to leave everything and return back. These are the struggles that go unnoticed, yet everyone goes through it, sooner or later in life. Miles and miles and away on a mission, all, for a Drop of Life.",
