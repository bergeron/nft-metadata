    "description": "\n\"Man is the measure of all things\"\nThis is a quote from Greek philosopher \"Protagoras\" regarding the theory of humanism. Humanism was fundamental to the Renaissance movement. Generally, I have always found the paintings of this movement to be a good example of portrait photography. Portrait photography has its origins in painting.\nLeonardo da Vinci's Vitruvius Man is a classic painting depicting Renaissance art and human fitness, a symbol of humanism.\nDue to this view, I have become interested in incorporating this symbol and concept into my work.\n\nEdition 1/1\nImage size - 6877 x 4912\nCreated - June 2022\n",
