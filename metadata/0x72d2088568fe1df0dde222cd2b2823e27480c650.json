    "description": "**Shame and Denial**\n\nThe two faces represent Shame and Denial. The denial is the frontmost face and denial is shame is behind it. Denial is easier to have in the front of facing my emotions, where shame is a bit harder to address. After finding out I was autistic, it challenged everything I knew about my life, past and present. On one hand I felt an immense relief knowing there was an answer to why I was the way I am. On the other hand, I felt some shame and denial coming up as I now had to accept that this was something that doesn't have a \"cure\". I felt shameful that there were areas of my life I would never be able to excel or even perform \"normally\" at.",
