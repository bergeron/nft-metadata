    "name": "The Green Vine Snake",
    "description": "The green vine snake is a creature that I have always wanted to see in my mind and take a picture of when I started wildlife photography. Although this snake is endemic everywhere, it is more common in the wild. Its color is very close to nature so it is very difficult to detect even if it is close by. Once upon a time, while walking through a forest, I heard the sound of something falling from a vine in the forest, so when I looked closer, it was a  green vine snake.  But the place where it was lying was not so good so I waited until it came to a good place. After waiting for some time, I click many pictures of it with my camera while trying to climb up through the roots of a tree. It's a dream come true for me.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nCollection: My Wildlife Stories \n\nLocation: Kerala, Kerala\n\nCamera & Lens: Nikon D750  Lens 200-500mm\n\nClicked by Safeer Abees\n(Award-Winning Wildlife Photographer Kerala, India)",
