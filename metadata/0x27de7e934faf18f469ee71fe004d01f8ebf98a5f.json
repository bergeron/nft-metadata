    "description": "A reflection of a strive to balance our public and private selves. The cityscape below represents the public realm, where we present ourselves to the world. \n\n  However, the mask of the cat woman suggests that there is also an element of secrecy and hiddenness that we all possess, a private self that we may choose to reveal only to a select few.\n\nUltimately, the art invites to reflect on the complex nature of the human experience and the ongoing quest for self-discovery and understanding.\n\nShot in Hong Kong",
