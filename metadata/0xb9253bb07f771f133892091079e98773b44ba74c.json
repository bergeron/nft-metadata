    "description": "The first bitcoin ever made! \nIt is believed that this first Bitcoin was produced as part of a well-conducted experiment designed by Stephen Hawking, Satoshi Nakamoto, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. \n\nSending matter and conscience through time to a discovered parallel universe to purchase/collect (unclear) specific afterlife data was the experiment's main objective. It was intercepted and confiscated at the universe border by the red multiverse guardian soul who desired to investigate the particular human reality and the real intentions. \n\nAfter Hawking's abduction on march 14 2018, a global collaboration began to interact with this multiverse being. Above cloud nine, at the center of the bloom birth vortex X1, the token is closely guarded. One wish, excluding eternal life, will be granted to anyone who touches it. Anyone who attempts and fails will be eternally hypnotized. \n\nIn one of my earlier pieces, PepectorNovice is shown trying desperately to get his hands on the rare first bitcoin!",
