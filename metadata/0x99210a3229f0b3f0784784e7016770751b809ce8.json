    "description": "It was a warm summer day in New Mexico, and I had watched this band of wild horses quietly grazing for most of the afternoon. I got a few shots, but the energy was low, and the skies flat. I was starting to resign myself to an uneventful day when beautiful monsoon clouds started to form, and the air cooled. Suddenly I felt the energy pick up; heads and ears swiveled in unison, calls went back and forth between the horses. I followed their gaze and saw a herd of elk on the far southern horizon. All at once they bolted, heading directly for the elk herd. I snapped my shutter furiously as they thundered by, knowing that these could be my last–and best–shots of the day. And they were.\n\nWhen I look at this image now, it reminds me that the future isn’t written, that there are no limits to what might happen, that there can be amazing opportunities around every corner if we only stay still long enough to see them.\n\n1/1 \n2014 \n7800 x 2600 px / 300 dpi",
