    "description": "2600x2600px 300dpi image. There are a total of 4 knights in a chess game (2 black and 2 white). A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an \"L\"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.",
