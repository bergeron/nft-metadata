    "description": "This is a reflection of my deep-rooted belief in the power of human connection. Each house represents each individual with our unique strengths and roles in life.\n\nInspired by the ancient city of Sertar, this series embraces our connectedness. It is a reminder that even with our diverse strengths and differences, we can light up each other's lives in ways beyond imagination.\n\nWhen I began this in March 2022, I used rice paper and Chinese inks on a large format to create the initial piece. I later integrated both traditional and modern methods by finishing it digitally. As an artist, I am committed to creating limited edition prints of the highest quality. \n\nOnly 5 artist proof hard copy prints are available for each version, ensuring exclusivity and excellence. \n\nI hope that you will be inspired to reflect on your own role in life and the ways in which you can contribute to strengthening human connection and creating a better world.",
