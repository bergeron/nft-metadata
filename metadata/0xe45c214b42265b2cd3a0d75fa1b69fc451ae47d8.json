    "description": "\"Industrial Zen\" is the first ever Homer Carbone limited edition illustration\n\nThis Industrial designed interior is represented by the couch tributing the \"Loungin'\" collection and the painting on the wall as the room's centerpiece, enriched by the painting light above it. On the sides you can find two wooden/metal shelves holding a bonsai tree, vases, a burning incense stick, and a tribute to the 0xdgb's iconic sayings: \"F*** Bots\" & \"Your Art Your Rules\"\n\nOn the floor, you can find a luxury carpet and a rich wooden floor holding it all together below it.\n\nThis illustration is fully hand-drawn and is finished by my signature textures.",
