    "description": "He is a camel herder bringing his herd for sale in a small camel town, Pushkar. A younger than most in his category and most open-minded as well. Always eager to connect and strike a conversation. He has always been eager to know why I was clicking his images and was always interested to know my travel stories.\nDuring this shoot, he was very restless and asked me if I had seen places outside India. When I said yes, he was curious. I shared some travel stories after which I just asked him to be himself while I clicked his images. This is one of such “informed candids” that I created on that particular day.\nHe might not have traveled beyond his village, but he is a true wanderlust in his own way.\nArtist: Jassi Oberai\nEdition: 1/1",
