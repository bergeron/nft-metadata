    "description": "This work is done in 2014 in watercolors. Sometimes in our lives we go through a very low phase in our life when we need some motivation & salvation to restore back faith and positive intent in our life. During this work i had a small accident and i was completely confined to my room, where art was the rescue for me to bring the positivity. There are some memories in our life which we never forget,some of them when i faced during creating this work. The final result of this not only motivated me but brought back the enthusiasm of creativity in me. It took me 17 days to create this work. But i enjoyed the process completely and i slowly recovered from the injuries of my accident to simultaneously . Art is sometimes not only a healer but a path shower for many of us in our life. Its truly our each work is a part of our life, sorrows & pain . I am really proud of this work and it is source of light for me.  The size of this work is 34 MB. The dimensions are 17000 x 11096 pixels ",
