    "description": "The Genesis of the Genesis. In this photo session I first tested the idea of the Segmented Portrait series. I wanted to showcase a black woman (in this case Rahilou) to show power yet gentleness. These photos were shot on the roof of my old Brooklyn Apartment. We draped white curtains on some backdrop stands and allowed the wind to shape the set.",
