    "description": "As a storyteller who does not know how to tell stories, I explore ways of communicating them beyond narration, historical order and legitimate ways of understanding. Drawing inspiration from dreams, phantasies and other sources of memory, I start painting with my mind, but the aim is to ‘lose it’ in the process. Fragments of declarative and non declarative memory are mixed and re-mixed in an attempt to grasp what resists interpretation. \n\nFollowing highly informal procedures, often gestural, improvisatory and rough, I use both my hands to draw objects and figures which sometimes completely disappear in the process, and sometimes not. The figurative start is important for me to begin with, but not to communicate. What is at stake is trusting a force which I do not control, letting my hand surpass my mind and to a certain extent my eyes, and stopping it before it eliminates everything. \n",
