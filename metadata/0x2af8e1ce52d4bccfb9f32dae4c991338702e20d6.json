    "description": "Milano-223 represents for me one of the first approaches to the photogrammetry technique.\nI grew up in a little town of just over 5,000 inhabitants. Starting to live Milan inspired me a lot: chaos, speed, buildings, subway, art.\nI owe a lot to this city and I'm very happy to be able to show it what it has in part transmitted to me.\nGrazie Milano.\n\nGabriele Verga (2023)\n3584x2048\nPiazza Sempione, 17-23 April, w/ ReasonedArt",
