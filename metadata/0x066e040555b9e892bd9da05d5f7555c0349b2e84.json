    "description": "Eid festival in Lagos and Nigeria at large is a very special celebration. The energy is during this season is very celebratory and totally unmatched... but one of the major highlights of Eid in Lagos, is the fashion statements by individual believers which is very fascinating. From native wears combined with modern day sneakers, to buttoned down shirts matched with opposing colored glasses and wristwatches, Eid remains one of the most memorable festivals in these parts.",
