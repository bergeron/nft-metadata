    "description": "Christopher Lee Rios (November 10, 1971 â€“ February 7, 2000), better known by his stage name Big Pun\n(short for Big Punisher), was an American rapper and songwriter. Pun's lyrics are notable for their technical\nefficiency, having exceptional breath control, heavy use of alliteration, as well as internal and multi-syllabic\nrhyming schemes. He is frequently cited as one of the best MCs of all time.[4][5] Emerging from the\nunderground hip hop scene in the Bronx borough of New York City in the early 1990s, he came to\nprominence during the latter half of the decade for his work with Fat Joe and the Terror Squad.",
