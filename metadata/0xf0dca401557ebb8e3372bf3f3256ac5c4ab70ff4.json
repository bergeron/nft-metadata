    "description": "Hailing from Griffintown is Gregory. Gregory has a studious side but knows how to put the book down and kick back when the time calls for it. On nice days you can find him strolling through Atwater Market. Nights are often spent lounging in the clubs. Oh and heâ€™s the cool one who can hit the low Bass notes.",
