    "description": "\"Geological Memory Traces\" captures the splendor of the Ubehebe Crater in California's Death Valley National Park. Ubehebe is a \"maar\" volcano formed by a steam and gas explosion that left behind a half-mile wide, 600-foot deep crater. The mineral-rich composites in the textured crater walls stand as a monument to the powerful terrestrial drama that created it.",
