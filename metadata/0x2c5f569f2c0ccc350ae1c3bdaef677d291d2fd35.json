    "description": "\"Over the Parisian Roofs\" is an unstaged streetphoto capturing a woman jumping over water with Parisian architecture in the background. Symbolically, it represents the constant pursuit of goals, neglecting beauty around us. The woman symbolizes our drive,  The photo reminds me to appreciate daily life moments. Through my street photography, I aim to capture raw, authentic moments that convey deeper meanings and inspire viewers to see the world around them in a new way. "
