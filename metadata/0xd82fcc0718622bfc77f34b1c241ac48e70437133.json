    "description": "Growing up as a kid, we all wanted to grow up so fast, we wanted our freedom and independence so bad , we admired the supposed freedom of our older relatives and we couldn't wait to be like them . \n  Unknowingly to us, this stage of life tends to come with some life circumstances and challenges we were apparently ignorant of, especially if you are not from a privileged home. Using my muse as a case study who represents everyone that can relate to this subject matter, he wasn't so prepared for the bills, the love life, the hustle scenes and all other responsibilities that comes with adulthood and now he has to take some responsibilities he's not prepared for compared to the kid life where all he had to do was to sleep, play and be fed . \n  However, every stage of life has always been an obstacle  right from cradle to the grave, from the womb to the tomb. We just always get to  figure each stage out eventually, solve it and move further. I think that's what life is all about after all.",
