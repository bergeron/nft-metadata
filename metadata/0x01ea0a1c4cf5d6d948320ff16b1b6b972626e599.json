A soul’s energy can be transferred into an initiate and raised within the Gen-U experience. The resulting art is generated based on in-game decision data.  Holders gain access to future collections, airdrops, comics, streetwear and playable characters within our MOBA: Legends of Hikari. Welcome to the home of the misfits 光",
