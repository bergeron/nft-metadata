    "description": "This drawing is based upon a tree from the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of the Eastern Sierras in California. Some trees here are as old as the pyramids. Each pillar of time grows slowly, battered and twisted by its extreme conditions.  \n\nThese trees are devoid of needles and pinecones. Their trunks contain a whole history of scars and struggles etched into their narrow rings. Their roots expand into an immense network of arteries and veins that break the dry alkaline soil they rest in. I envision myself in the future walking amongst their ruins looking for what life is left behind.\n\nDigital artwork based off of a pen and ink drawing.",
