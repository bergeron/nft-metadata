    "description": "The photographic illustrations of the Manhattan Bridge were created with the intention of creating distinct visual worlds from the same reality. \n\nI have always perceived life as a very textured vibratory state with many cavities, roughness, life is never smooth, it is these different textures that generate our daily life.\n\nThree visuals, three different atmospheres, a multitude of textures in opposition with the central part of the bridge which is relatively smooth, at least in appearance...\n\nEdition: 1/1\nSize: 8000 x 5340 pixels\nFormat: JPG\nTechnique: Mix media, composite: Photography + Digital Art\nSoftware used: Adobe Photoshop, Topaz Lab and creativity",
