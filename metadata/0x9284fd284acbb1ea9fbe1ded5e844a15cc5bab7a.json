    "description": "There are a million stories waiting to be told...\n\nStories that reveal themselves after entering a process of dissociation of self, releasing that silver thread that binds our spirit and body letting us be completely free...\n\nThese stories have left a trace of their existence in something as subtle as a scar, a wrinkle, or even a light shimmer in the eyes...\n\nThey whisper to us hoping that we listen to them...\n\nHoping that we pause for a second, and read the pages of that book by entering through the eyes and taking a deep dive into the ocean of their existence called Soul.\n\n-\n\nBy: Ilan Derech\nLocation: Marrakesh, Morocco\nShot on: Sony A7Rii & ZEISS Loxia 2/50\nYear: 2019",
