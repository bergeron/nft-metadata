    "description": "CRIMINAL DROP: 1/2 UNIQUE ITEMS\n\nPussy Riot activists and queer couple Lucy Stein and Maria Alyokhina have been put on trial for instigating mass protests in Moscow and sentenced to the “restriction of freedoms” — a fancy term for a house arrest. Masha and Lucy have cut off their ankle monitors, duped police surveillance and managed to cross the Russian border. Both are now on a Putin’s wanted list.\n\nWe’ve recreated Federal Penitentiary Service ankle tags — including the stickers girls decorated them with. These are our trophies from the fight with the government. We believe that fetters will be gone.\n\nLucy and Masha wore these bracelets for a year. Despite house arrest, Lucy and Masha had been arrested regularly for 15 days for no reason. Back in 2012, Masha served two years in prison for a punk-prayer “Mother Mary, drive Putin away”. \n\nHalf of the profits will go to Ukrainians suffering from the war & Russian political prisoners repressed for the antiwar position.",
