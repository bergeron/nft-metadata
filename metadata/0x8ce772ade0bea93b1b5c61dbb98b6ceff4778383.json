    "description": "Curved Landscape - Video mp4 - 1080 x 1920 - 0:10 sec - 2021.\n\nHis work's naturalistic and organic aspect finds its conceptual, inspiring, and symbolic support in the natural landscape, matter, and space. \n\nThis particular work is called Curved Landscapes, was inspired by his career as a sculptor.  It is part of a series of videos that attempt to question, from analog to digital, and are a clear allusion to the plant world that surrounds us, to the esoteric of the spatial landscape, above all, to the energy of our natural cosmos.",
