    "description": "Electric Eagles are the baddest birds on the blockchain.  A collection of 13,000 unique, code generated eagles live on the Ethereum network.  They have been electrified by crypto and have either devolved into zombies, vampires and vultures, or evolved into aliens and other meta beings.  There are many rare attributes and costumes, and some even have fresh prey still in their beaks.  Each PFP is beautifully crafted with pixels, the best medium for the blockchain! These blistering birds are ready to rock your blocks off.   ðŸ¤˜ ðŸ¦… ðŸ¤˜",
