    "description": "USD (United States Death) features U.S. currency alongside images of U.S. military conflicts. The juxtaposition of these two elements argues that there is a link between U.S. military interventions and the status of the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency.\n\nThe images of U.S. military conflicts in this piece can be seen as a reflection of the U.S. government's desire to maintain the dollar's position as the world reserve currency. The inclusion of U.S. currency alongside these images serves as a reminder of the economic power and influence that the U.S. wields in the global economy, and the ways in which military interventions have been used to protect and promote these interests.",
