    "name": "Eve",
    "description": "         The genesis piece from Garden of Eden â€“ Evolution is Eve. Why? Because in my opinion, the old writings depict Eve as the downfall of Eden, the temptation, where all wrongs started from. I strongly disagree, as it casts a dark shadow over every woman from past, present and future and could be one of the source ingredients to discrimination. \n         Eve, as the embodiment of women, is a creator of life. Young, beautiful, part innocent part mischievous and full of dreams. Her wings spread for the first time, eager to feel and know the air of life, with all that it may bring. She is ready to face the storms and sing to the sun. Eve is not the doom bringer, but the light of dawn.  \n",
