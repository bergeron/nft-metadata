    "description": "As up to half a million tonnes of microplastics from textiles is washed into the oceans every year, some of these particles find their way back to humans, even into our own bodies, completing the circle. In \"Rewind\" series the author explores such themes as irresponsible overconsumption, overproduction, pollution and human's place in this cycle as both the cause and the target. The transforming \"landscapes\" seen throughout the video are the result of a neural network trying to interpret images of plastic trash piles as landscapes, ominously predicting our possible grim future.\n\nEdition: 1/1\nFormat: 3d animation, AI art\nResolution: 1920x1080 px\nFrame rate: 25 fps",
