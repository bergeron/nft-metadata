    "description": "In 2020, I became the owner of a miniature poodle named Mila. She completely changed my life with her unconditional love and affection. She was independent, and at 6 months old she ate something toxic which abruptly ended her life before we could save her. Although our time together had a tragic ending, I learned how fragile life is and to enjoy the good moments we have with one another. ",
