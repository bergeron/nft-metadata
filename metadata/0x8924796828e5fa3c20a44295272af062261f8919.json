    "name": "The three faces of self",
    "description": "The Japanese say you have three faces. \nThe first face, you show to the world. \nThe second face, you show to your close friends, and your family. \nThe third face, you never show anyone. It is the truest reflection of who you are.\n\nPeople are complicated, and much of what makes us who we are is hidden beneath the surface. As we interact with different people, we reveal different layers of ourselves. The same is true of your character, they will express themselves differently depending on the people around them.\n\nHow well do you know your character? And how well do the people around them know them?\n\nWho is your character when people are watching? Who is your character when they’re not?\nThink of “faces” as what’s showing: expression, opinion, reaction. Each face represents a different way your character interacts with and reveals themselves to the world.",
