    "description": "RELIX – Analog Edition\n\nPage of Wands\n\nNascent fire nature. Inspiration often strikes like a bolt of lightning. Sometimes it touches the right surface and sparks a creative blaze; other times it’s as gone as fast as it appeared. Picture this potential in human form and you have your Page of Wands. When this card appears in a reading, search around for the person who stirs you to action, or look inward for the aspect of yourself that’s easily inspired.\n\nDesigned by Jiminie Ha & Jeremy Parker\nText by Michael George Land\nMore info at wolfhouse.art",
