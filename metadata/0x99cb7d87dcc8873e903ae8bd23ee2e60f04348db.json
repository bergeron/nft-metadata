Each waving of these carpets serves as the background for stunning female faces that are culturally bound to the pattern of the weaving itself.\n\n ↠ Mateo paints in the streets since 2005 and is now exhibited in Art Galleries worldwide along with renowned artists.\n↠ Soundscape by Soul Of Zoo / Benjamin Heggerick & Robin Girard",
