    "description": "I started drawing seriously in April 2022, and I still have a lot to learn.\n\nThis is my hardest piece that I finished so far, my god the despair that I went through to finish this on a deadline bruh... I actually had plenty of time to finish a piece, like a month plus. I ended up with 1 unfinished piece and this one. \n\nI spent 3 weeks working on the first concept and it's only maybe 30% done. And I realize that I done goof and I donâ€™t have time to finish it. It took me that long to do the first concept because of the complexity of that piece, my overwhelming depression and borderline procrastination. \n\nSo with the little time I had, I needed to make a new \"easier\" piece, and I ended up with this. To be more productive I bought a mini desk for my laptop that I can put on my bed, so I can work on this piece frame 1 right after I wake up. So I gathered all my last 2 frog brain cells to make this in like a little bit over a week. \n\nShout out to @DeFiDave22 for giving me the opportunity to make this piece for Stable Salon, and shout out to BENEE and Trillionaire Mindset podcast for making me sane in my multiple 8 hours painting session.",
