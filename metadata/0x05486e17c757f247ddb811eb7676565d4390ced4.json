    "description": "i wrote ‘going to california’ when i was feeling a bit trapped in london, so i started to romanticize escaping to a different place. i was originally born in california and i’ve always wondered how my life would look if i grew up there. i’ve kept it as a place in my mind i could escape to, which is what i wanted to say in this song. i really hope you can relate to it in someway!",
