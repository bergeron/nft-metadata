    "description": "The Yasaka Pagoda (also known as Tower of Yasaka, or Hokan-ji 法観寺) has been calling to me since I first saw images of it. \n\nWhile living in Kobe in 2017, I spent almost every weekend commuting to Kyoto to visit this place, breathe the air and take in the views. \n\nThe pagoda has been standing there since the late 6th century, although it’s been rebuilt several times. The pagoda itself as you see in the photo was completed in 1408 and stands to this day. \n\nOver the course of five years, I visited Kyoto perhaps twenty times, constantly refining my vision and attempting to capture the beauty of this city in different surroundings, from spring to summer to fall to winter. It remains one of my most favorite places to travel and explore, and I hope it inspires you to travel as well. \n\nTo this day, this is my most retweeted work ever, seen by millions of people all around the world. \n\n\n  - Dimensions: 4000x2666px  \n  - Date: January 30, 2020  \n  - Camera: Fujifilm X-T2  \n  - Lens: Fujifilm XF 23mm f/1.4 R  \n  - Aperture: f/6.4  \n\n\nEdition of 69",
