    "description": "Light installation made from wooden hangers which are bound in a star-shaped form. The object is placed on a round white table in front of a white wall. The geometric form of the installation is pretty simple but due to multiple intersections of its elements, it seems to have a complex eye-pleasing structure.\n\nNFT only, original installation not included.",
