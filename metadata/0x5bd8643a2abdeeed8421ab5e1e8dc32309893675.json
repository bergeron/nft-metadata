    "description": "I found this location in Northwest Arkansas and returned a few days later to get the morning fog and light coming from the east. I drove 2 1/2 each way the following week, coming back for the shot. As I pulled up and set up on a bridge, I decided the better shot was to hike to the banks and wade into the water with camera/tripod. Luckily a fisherman was was there with his boat..so I waited for the right moment.\n\nSometimes you must put yourself in a different place to get the shot that speaks to you the most. ",
