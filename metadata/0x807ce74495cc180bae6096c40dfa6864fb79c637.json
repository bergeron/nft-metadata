    "description": "Imagine that Hip-Hop had a superhero.\n\nHis mission? To save his first love, Hip-Hop — the genre that raised him from destruction.\n\nNow picture his journey unfolding as a visual-musical experience where song lyrics are brought to life as comic art.\n\nOn a quest to save the cultural movement that gave him light in the darkest hours of his youth, GHOST-EMC (a now up-and-coming MC), fights to reclaim his first  love, Hip-Hop, and return her back to her truest form by any means necessary.\n\nDespite being guided by good intentions — the desire to save Hip-Hop, GHOST is a flawed, conflicted character with a dark side and a few bad habits.\n\nThis NFT is the trailer for “G.H.O.S.T. [INTERLUDE]” - the debut single \nand it marks a very special moment on our Superhero's quest to save Hip-Hop. This is the very first time the world gets to hear any music or see a selection of comic art created out of his song lyrics. \n\n“Friends & Family” welcome to \"PHANTOM CITY\", an exciting adventure awaits. \n\nOne Love,\n\nGHOST.",
