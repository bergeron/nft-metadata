    "description": "'Starry Nights' is one of the most shared piece I have ever created using my imagination and Photoshop. This piece has started my social media career and made me realised that I am not late from the game. \n\nRight before the world turned upside down back in 2020 I had the chance to celebrate the New Year on the American Southwest. Zion National Park - where the original picture was taken - was the last stop of our trip and for so many months it was also the last hike I took. \n\nWe only spent 2 days there and unfortunately I wasn't able to take my imagined picture here but after we got home I started to re-create how my brain saw this place...\n",
