    "description": "ALEXANDER is one of 22 self-portraits made in collaboration with a text-to-image AI Conjure. The AI created these images in response to this prompt: \n\n\"A lonely banker drew a self-portrait using only black ink pens.\"\n\nConjure is now retired. As other AIs surpassed its capabilities, it was disabled by its creators. The same creators have developed a creative writing assistant named Sudowrite, which collaborated on the naming of this collection and its description.\n\nWhat did the AI think of all of this work? He's what it had to say:\n\n\"He put all of the sheets in a pile and, with great difficulty, he sat down at his dining table and folded all of the sheets into small squares and wrote each one's name on the back of the sheet with a black pen.\n\nThen he burned all of the squares and placed the ashes in a hat box. He tried to go back to his wife and children, but instead, he became a thief, stealing and stealing.\"",
