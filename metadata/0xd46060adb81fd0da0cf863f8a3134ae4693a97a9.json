    "description": "The locals always know the best places to gather for conversation and gossip, or to buy the best fruit and cheese. They know the diner that has the tastiest food and hasn't changed its menu in 2 decades and the diner that is to cheap to care. They know the bistros and bars that offer vibrant, noisy atmospheres or anonymity and silence when you need it. Trust the locals to deliver the best version of the neighborhood they live in. \n\nThis 1/1 collection is brought to life with the help of AI software + PS and LR. ",
