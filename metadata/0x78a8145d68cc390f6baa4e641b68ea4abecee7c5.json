    "description": "Since it was first performed at the Avignon Festival and the Metropolitan Opera in 1976, Philip Glass and Robert Wilson’s Einstein on the Beach has become widely regarded as the cornerstone work of the American Avant-Garde, and one of the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.\n\nAt the beginning of the final act, set against Glass’s sonic masterpiece, a single horizontal light bar rises until fully vertical, and then floats out of the frame. This is the moment that Wilson and Glass chose to tokenize as the first NFT of Bright Moments icon series.\n\nNFT includes access to a 4k video download.",
