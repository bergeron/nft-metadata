    "description": "Practitioners call Immunis Metallicum (\"Doc\") a \"wonder drug\" cure-all that equips the body with an impenetrable forcefield against all viruses and germs. A dose of Doc ripples a visible shock wave through the system seconds before establishing ironclad immunity.\n\nUnfortunately, the spores never make it through Earth's atmosphere intact. Their phantom elemental makeup scrambles beneath the microscope, where they identify as a common white button mushroom.\n\nResearchers remain relentless in the attempt to crack Doc's code for hasty international distribution.\n\nCreated by Floontz & Elise Weiland",
