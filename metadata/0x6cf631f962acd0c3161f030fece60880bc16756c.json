    "description": "After watching David Attenborough's Africa from 2003 in 2021, the subject that I have found repeated in every series over the years is the damages caused by humanity to the earth. As a father to 2 young children, watching this programme nearly 18 years on... I realised we aren't doing enough. As my profile has gained international traction the past few years, I want to create art that provokes emotional reactions, positive or negative on subjects that can create conversations to inspire a better humanity.\n\nPainted freehand using spray paint in October 2021 for Korpfest in isolation event at Serpentine Shopping Centre, Peterborough. Photographed, refined in procreate by Nyces and NFT version created by MRKSTEELS.\n\nThis was also released in a 25 limited edition signed print version. ",
