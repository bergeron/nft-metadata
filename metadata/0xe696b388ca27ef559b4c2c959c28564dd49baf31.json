    "name": "New American Symbol",
    "description": "After the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, the newly founded United States of America sought a symbol to represent the nation. In 1782 the founding fathers and Congress decided on the bald eagle to be the symbol for the United States, despite Benjamin Franklin's proposal for the turkey instead.\n\nFor centuries the way the bald eagle has been represented in popular culture has not been stylistically updated. This new rendition of the bald eagle seeks to represent the values of Americans in our time. In a sense this piece wishes to be a visual representation of how Americans aspire to expand individual freedom and opportunity in our time, while also representing the evolving artistic tastes and expressive abilities that are present in this very moment. Overall, this piece is meant to be a time machine for the viewer years from now. \n\nNeither love nor terror makes one blind; Indifference makes one blind. - James Baldwin",
