    "description": "The  cenote Jardin del Eden (Pon-de Rosa) lives up to its name 'Garden of Eden'. Located amidst the lush green jungle, the cenote looks like a large pool from above, but illuminates a large cave system below. Rays of light penetrating through the roots of the trees create a mysterious and beautiful atmosphere. When diving in 'Eden', you pass through a thick halocline (the interference of fresh and salt water), which makes this cenote even more beautiful. This cenote in particular blew me away with its beautiful play of light through to the roots.\n\n",
