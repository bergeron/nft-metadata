    "description": "Like sunflowers all the people that ride this van move in synchronicity. The official flower of Ukraine, while  beautiful, and robust, is also a source of protein and oil. This van is a magical time machine, where passengers are transported to the dreamy utopian counter culture days of the 1970â€™s. Where a world with no war was an idea that impregnated the mainstream, and many dared to dream of a van life, off the grid, full of endless joy rides ever-extending horizons of sunflowers. \n\n Modeling by Pablo Munoz Gomez, texturing by Pablo Munoz Gomez and Stefano Corazza. \n Tools: Substance Painter, Photoshop, Blender 3d.",
