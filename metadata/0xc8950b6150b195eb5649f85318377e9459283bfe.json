    "description": "In many cultures, the dragonfly is a symbol for new beginnings, adaptation and change. \n\nI found this dragonfly floating on the lake thinking she was dead, but as I held her on my palm she moved a bit. I realized the broken wing, so I wondered if she could fly at all. Her wings dried up and she suddenly started flying. \n\nThis image is to me a reminder of the power of patience and resilience, to go on after it seems its all over.",
