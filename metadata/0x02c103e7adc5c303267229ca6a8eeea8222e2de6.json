    "description": "\"Brain Fog\" is about zoning out, losing focus and having a short attention span. Feeling lost in the fog of ADHD.\n\nAround 2 years ago or a little more and after many years of experiments I began learning 3D animation and have been on a mission to keep learning it ever since. After posting my work recently online I was told by a fair few people in response, that my animations “tickled their brains in a good way” or that it was “soothing for their ADHD mind”, I also heard from someone working with children who have autism saying they had been showing my videos to the children to help them feel calmer because of the calming aesthetic of the videos. I found this super inspiring and wanted to focus my work around that more. I love the idea that by using art to help myself to feel calm, I can help another person feel calm from that same moment forever after that.\n\nIn this series I will focus on creating moving images and sounds that sooth the mind, scratch the brain in a good way and help bring moments of calm in to others around the world who need it. I would also like to bring more awareness to the struggles with mental health surrounding these conditions and other forms of neurodiversity in children and young adults.",
