    "description": "The Heart-Project produced music video to Prentiss’ “running back,’’ from his debut EP hey prentiss. Produced by Y2K (featured in the video as a smiling tree), the song started as a simple guitar riff that evolved into an upbeat, heartfelt track. The playful narrative of the video moves through a morning in the life of Prentiss, who has overslept for school. Viewers follow Prentiss into a whimsical dream state and back into reality after a rude awakening from his father (played by Benny Blanco).",
