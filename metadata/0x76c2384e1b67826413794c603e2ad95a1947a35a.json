    "description": "The Doom GIFs animate parts of Matthew’s epic painting 'Doomscroll', a cartoonish rendition of Hell from Matthew Harris’s solo presentation at Melbourne Art Fair 17-20 Feb, '22.  \n \nAppropriating nightmarish medieval European masters, Matthew’s iconographic style is an expansive pictorial language – cute emojis with a death metal soundtrack. Here, the punished are early colonial missionaries with their worst fears coming true. Revenge is a dish best served hot, a digital hex to your worst frenemies only. \n \nMatthew GIFs are used by almost 12 million lost souls on GIPHY. Artist of mixed European and Australian Aboriginal heritage, based in Melbourne, Australia. Featured in Art Collector, Financial Review, The Art Paper. Exhibited at galleries and museums worldwide. \n",
