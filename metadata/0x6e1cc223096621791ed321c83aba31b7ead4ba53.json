    "description": "Alpha utility token for the FLECS application, the first NFT application that doesn't put your assets at risk.\n\nFLECS Master Keys NFTs are not required to sign-up and use the FLECS app, but to access “project owner” features you will need to hold Master Key NFTs.  In addition to special access to features and support, Master Key NFTs will generate FLECS app invites on a recurring basis based off of rarity, edition, and generation.\n\nAdditionally Master Key NFTs act as a mint pass for Event NFTs, which allow a project owner to \"fast track\" onboard their holders by receiving a large batch of app invites at once.\n\nflecs.co for more information",
