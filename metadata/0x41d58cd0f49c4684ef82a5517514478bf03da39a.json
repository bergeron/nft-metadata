I have been reborn.  \n\nA piece that reflects the journey, processes, and challenges the self undergoes to reach this reality. Now, in this piece, I meet again with my 2021 self, but this time on another block and with a new direction to thank those portals that were showing me the way to this moment.\n\nEinstein believed that you right now have been dead for trillions of years, but you haven't been born yet. That everything has happened to you and if you could get the right perspective on the universe, you could see all at once.",
