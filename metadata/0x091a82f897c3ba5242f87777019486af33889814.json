    "description": "COVERED CARS  \nCVRD by Karin Apollonia Müller and Peter Nitsch\n\nKarin Apollonia Müller and Peter Nitsch, both German lens-based artists, have been photographing covered cars over the last couple of years. Müller in Los Angeles, California, Nitsch in Bangkok, Thailand. Müller uses an ethereal palette of muted tones during daylight to sunset whereas Nitsch makes use of the nightly silence of colored spotlights and vibrant fluorescent street lights. Müller consequently horizontal, Nitsch consequently vertical.\n\nBoth positions go beyond a typological approach in the sense of the german traditional Becher school fostering an attitude of detached observation and striking picture detail. They both explore the nexus of cultural understanding and the allure of the unknown and hidden, mystery and certainty, conspiracy and truth.\n\n66 CVRD cars minted on a Manifold contract, CVRD is broken down into the following categories:\n\nTier 1: 10 CVRD cars (5 by each artist)  \nTier 2: 24 CVRD cars (12 by each artist)  \nTier 3: 20 CVRD cars (10 by each artist)  \nGrail: 10 CVRD cars (5 by each artist)  \nTrophy: 2 CVRD cars (1 by each artist)\n\nPhotographers:  \nhttps://karinapolloniamueller.com  \nhttps://peternitsch.com",
