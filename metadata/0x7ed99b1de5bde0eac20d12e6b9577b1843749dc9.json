    "description": "One day, as I was walking down the street, I saw a man laughing and talking to his friends.\nThe man, who had both legs amputated above the knee, was laughing and smiling as he sat in a wheelchair.\nWe looked at each other and he smiled at me.\nI went ahead and asked him can I take a picture from you?\nAs he shook his head, he smiled and said, \"Take ten pictures\"\nI grabbed the camera and started shooting.\nThe great and kind soul of the man could be seen in his eyes.\nWe talked for a while and I enjoyed our conversation.\nThe memory of him will live on in my heart forever.",
