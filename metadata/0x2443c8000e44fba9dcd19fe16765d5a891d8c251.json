    "description": "We all know and love the Golden Gate Bridge. I wanted to try and capture it from a different perspective, so while exploring around waiting for the sunrise, I stumbled across this hole in a fence, which allowed for a cool foreground, and some awesome bokeh from the car headlights crossing the bridge. \n\nEven though it's blurred, anyone can clearly point out the Golden Gate in all it's glory in the background. This moment was followed by a sunrise to remember.",
