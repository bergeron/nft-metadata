    "description": "A struggle to harness the energy you’ve kept for a long time owing to unsettled feelings, occupied negativity, reluctancy and questioning yourself whether you are a self taught procrastinators or just plain lazy. You convinced that you are capable and will do wonders but there’s always a ‘but’ on the bridge of a sentence.
