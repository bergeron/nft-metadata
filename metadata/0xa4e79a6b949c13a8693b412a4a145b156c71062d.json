    "description": "A tribute to Pepenardo...  a prodigious artistic talent. He has one foot in the traditional art world and one foot in the crypto/meme art world. The Ellsworth Kelly background represents the one while the Pepefied Billy Martin represents the other. The base card is the 1972 Topps \"middle finger\" Billy Martin. Another iconic design from 1950s-70's Topps and this card is famous for the sly middle finger Martin gave the photographer. I like to think of it as Pepenardo giving a subtle middle finger to the traditional art world with his work in the memeverse. I don't know for sure if that's how he feels, but nevertheless I enjoy that idea.  In any case, I see this tiny painting as a portrait of sorts of my friend.",
