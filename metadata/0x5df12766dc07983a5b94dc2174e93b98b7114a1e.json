    "description": "Assembly and Sasha Wolf present One Star and a Dark Voyage, the genesis collection from acclaimed photographer Barbara Bosworth. This project, made with Bosworth’s customary 8x10 camera, speaks to our connections with nature: bear paws hauntingly human, roses cut to bring beauty indoors, a swan hunted for Christmas dinner. The visceral and the ethereal intermingle here to build a sense of the delicate and fragile nature of life, at a place where the edges of heaven and earth blur. In One Star and a Dark Voyage, we are brought into intimate communion with such things as a wound on a sun-freckled shin, a worm as stigmata in a child’s hand, a bird lying in a cupped hand, a body hovering in the darkness—all evoking the ephemeral nature of life. The result: a collection of photographs that functions as a journey, where weight becomes light. The beautiful and the terrible, all interconnected, all the same. Always seeking home.",
