    "description": "ARGO Gold Mine & Mill. Idaho Springs, Colorado. Now, a relic of the bustling Gold Rush era of the 19th century--a ghost of its former self.\n\nOver a century ago while it was in full operation, one might have seen smoke billowing out of the Mill as it's large furnaces burned massive amounts of coal to power the Mill.  \n\nBut on this day, I was reminded of how this proud relic might have looked as the beautiful billowing clouds offered an unforeseen gift--a glimpse into the past.",
