    "description": "35 mm black & white film photograph (double exposed)  \nShot at Galerie Hertz in Louisville, KY  \n2014  \n12.5’’x 16’’\n\nThis double exposure features a portrait of Darryl Parker overlain with an up-close shot of one of Russ Vogt’s mosaic sculptures. The piece was meant to represent the self as a unique amalgamation of the influences, experiences, and people that make up each of our lives. This photograph is special to me because Darryl worked with my mother at Galerie Hertz, where my father showed art while I was growing up, and Russ lived in my childhood home before my parents bought it from him. This piece represents some of the people and environments that make me who I am, and hope this piece remind you of what makes you who you are. The owner of this NFT will receive the original 1/1 darkroom print.",
