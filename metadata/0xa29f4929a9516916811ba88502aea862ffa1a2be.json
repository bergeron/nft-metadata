    "description": "First of September rolls along and the boiz roll out of every half-built nest with their peckers sharpened. Too late for taxes now, because youse bettabelieve there’ll be blood. Homes weren’t built in a day, so prep your homemade eyes-painted-on ice-cream tub helmets and antenna extensions for a full season of swoops. This is their time, not ours.\n\n---\n\nArtwork & Design by Ben Toupein\nhttps://planetaustralia.art\n\nAlso available in limited-edition physical format via the Brown Cardigan Shop: https://shop.browncardigan.com/collections/planet-australia.",
