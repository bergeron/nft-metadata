Nowadays, because of the problem of dust from PM2.5 Causing people to wear masks almost all the time Other than that, no problem was solved. or assistance from any agency Nowadays people have to rely on themselves. What you can do each day is to only put on a mask and use an air purifier. To make the weather better as possible only..\n\nIt is a work that I drew to support the awareness of the dust problem in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\nAnd this is a work that joins the mini art exhibition \"Land of smoke\" together with a group of 20 Chiang Mai artists.",
