    "description": "This reflects the difficulties I encountered while creating digital art; although opportunities often appeared to slip by, the \"when\" moment was always approaching.\n\nMost people are likely familiar with the expression \"having a place at the table.\"  \nThe table has come to represent authority, bartering, and credibility as a means of advancing one's career. We long for the window to be in the spotlight, but it's always crucial to recognise the people who helped you get there.\n\nA work produced for an exhibition at the renowned Tate Modern Gallery in London as part of a partnership between Instagram and myself for Metaâ€™s Creator Week 2022.\n\n\n\n",
