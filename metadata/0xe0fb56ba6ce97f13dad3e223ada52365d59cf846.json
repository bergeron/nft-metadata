    "description": "During my journey through psychedelic experiences, I came across a desert. I walked through this desert during my meditation. The conceptual reflections I encountered were quite effective. I tried to convey this very complex and intense experience by simplifying it as much as possible. We should all get lost in the desert inside us.\n\n-  \nWhen we came to life, we were alone in the womb. No matter how many people we touch until we die, we will die alone as an inevitable end. Just like a baby in the womb. I overcame my fear of loneliness when I encountered an unborn baby in the desert.",
