    "description": "The way we talk, we act, we create – all of it is a product of Zeitgeist. This art piece as well. But it is also a portrayal of contrasts. Religion/traditonalism vs. atheism/modernism. Whether it is the choice of the medium, the intention of this art or the elements that were used. The way art is created today differs immensely from how it was created hundreds of years ago and yet it‘s all connected. Because we are spirits of our time.\nAnd in the end this is all we ever will be– »ZEITGEISTER«.",
