    "description": "This letter breaths. With it, you can calm your mind following the 4:4:4:4 breathing exercise: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and repeat.\n\nThis letter will help you calm your mind while the ETH price rises or falls (you will see it, and you can breathe while the background tells you if the price is changing -it compares today vs. yesterday-).\n\nThis NFT has been created using a generative approach for the color palette as well as for the shape and speed of the particles. The NFT changes dynamically as it watches the price of ETH.",
