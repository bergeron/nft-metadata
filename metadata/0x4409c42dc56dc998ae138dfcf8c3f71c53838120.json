    "description": "This NFT is minted on behalf of @Leroosh_Derrick and @Yan_Bers with all proceeds of the sale going to her directly.  \nA young woman who just one day after her graduation, thinking she now had all the opportunities to enrich the artistic world and contribute with her creative vision, found herself in a bunker with her best friend @Yan_Bers.  \nShe drew this into the sand on the bunker's ground, wiping away the traces of heavy boots, expressing her innermost feelings the best way she could.  \nFor now, she is safe, and we worry and hope along with her that she may soon safely return into the sunlight where we will all be waiting with open arms.  \nHope. Peace. Love. For Derrick, Yan, and a whole country.",
