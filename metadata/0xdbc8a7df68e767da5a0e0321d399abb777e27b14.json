    "description": "\"My first day in Web3\" is an art piece about the Web3 discovery.\n\nDrawn and animated by hand, \"My first day in Web3\" is a mixed of 2D and 3D technique. Inspired by Japanese anime, here is my own perception and feelings the first time I worked on Web3 : the power of the Web3 community, the discovery of cryptocurrency, virtual galleries, digital art marketplaces, web3-based video games. It was a portal to a new and innovative world.\n\nThis art is a piece of memory, a moment and a nostalgia: our very first meeting with Web3 world. For each of us, a reflection of a specific moment of our life that we only known.\n\nCreated by Rodger Liukane\nApprox. time: 35hr\nProcreate, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Photoshop and Cinema4D\nSeamless loop in MP4\n2480x3508px [A4 paper size]",
