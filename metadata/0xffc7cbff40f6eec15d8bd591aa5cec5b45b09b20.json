    "description": "In collaboration with Watch Photographer @which_watch_next - This is the Grand Illusion. \n\nIn 2015 Seiko released a pair of Quartz (9F Movement) Grand Seiko Dive watches, with a Black and White dial, or as I like to call it - the Yin/Yang Divers. The SBGX115 (White dial) and the SBGX117 (Black dial). Although these were not limited edition releases, they were released for a very limited period of time and Seiko discontinued these divers in 2018. \n\nThis is the first of many watch related NFTs and as the first, this one is special. So to the first buyer of this NFT, the buyer will also receive both the watches. Both the SBGX115 and the SBGX117 are in excellent condition and come with Original Box and Papers. \n\nAs I said this is an experiment and how it ends, only time will tell. \n\n\nDimensions: 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)\nFormat:  MP4",
