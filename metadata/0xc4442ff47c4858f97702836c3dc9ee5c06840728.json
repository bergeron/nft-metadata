    "description": "He used to be a funny man and made everyone around him laugh. \"It's a talent!\", \"You're so funny!\", he heard it all the time and decided that was his calling. He decorated his face with paints and those paints consumed him. He no longer belonged to himself. Those paints were the darkness that had been hiding inside him all the time, and that had taken pleasure in pulling him into its net. \"Why aren't you laughing now?\" he asked, \"Am I no longer funny? LAUGH!\" \n\n\"Sad Joker Skull\", 2022/07.",
