    "description": "Opposed to gravity (associated with heaviness), levitation is lightness. \n\nIn a metaphorical sense, it deals with freedom from the bondage of the physical world holding you back and rise by using the power of your mind.  Freedom is a bird being let out of a cage. But freedom is also living your life on your own terms and achieving the kind of happiness and success defined by no one else but you.\n\nThe project is about being the master of your own destiny, subconsciously navigating through life to fulfil your lifeâ€™s purpose. It is a manifestation of self-expression without limits and restrains in the World where people are open-minded and perceptive.\n\n\n",
