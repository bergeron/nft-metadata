    "description": "Where does petroleum come from? ðŸ›¢\n\nThis precious liquid that enriches few and kills many? Portals to the underworld have opened, filled with materials that once were living, now smell putrid and sharp, and spread soot through the air. \n\nWe brought to the surface what nature throughout the existence of life has judged necessary to store underground, in deep soil, far away from us human beings living on the surface. \n\nWe set fires and spread smoke all over the planet, covering with a thick fog the hope of a decent future for children. You breathe death, and there is no escape from it. Or is there still time?",
