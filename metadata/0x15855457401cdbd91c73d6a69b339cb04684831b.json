    "description": "Hi my name is Darren! Thank you for coming along on this adventure with me. The WOozee character that you hold was created from a strange paint in my studio... it turned out that this ochre coloured paint, was actually these alien lifeforms. These aliens can mimic objects, in this case they took on the form of my paintings. I'm slowly teaching them how to adapt to the world we live in!! I think they even have unique abilities....Holders of this NFT have full print rights!! feel free to go ahead and get me printed!!! Cheers and look forward to more amazing WOozee goodness...this is just the first part of my story!! Holders of This NFT will also get exclusive first dibs and pay the same mint for season two, which will see another tight limited run of WOozeez dropping 2023.",
