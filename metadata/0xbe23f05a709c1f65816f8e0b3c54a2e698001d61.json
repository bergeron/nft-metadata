    "description": " Thematically, the works combine existing social debates on normativity, self-determination and the performance of genderidentities through the taboo phenomenon of revirginization. In the three-channel film installation C + H = CH gender-specific image stereotypes are juxtaposed to the construction of an oversized hymen (also called Vaginal Corona, formerly maiden skin) made of liquid latex. Through this hymen, a third gender is born. The stereotyped representation of the binary gender order is broken. ",
