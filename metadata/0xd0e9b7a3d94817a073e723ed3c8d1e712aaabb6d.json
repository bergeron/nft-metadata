    "description": "A series of photographs shot on a medium format film camera in Israel, exploring and documenting the sometimes historical, sometimes mundane, landscape.\n\nBorn and raised in Israel, Iâ€™ve always felt a keen affinity for its landscape. Photographing on every visit to my homeland, then processing and scanning the film upon returning to my home in the U.S., has kept that affinity alive. \n\nA portion of the proceeds will be donated to support art initiatives in Palestine.",
