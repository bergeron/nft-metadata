    "description": "The snake game was one of my childhood hobbies. I first saw and played it on my Nokia 1100 phone. I always wanted to finish it but it was very difficult.\n20 years passed until I was able to simulate this game by learning programming and simulation in MATLAB software and see its end. This is a short film from the beginning to the end of this game, which I presented as nft.",
