    "description": "This song is meant to accompany a walking meditation. Whats that?\nWalking Meditation - Choose a foot to start with. Pick it up, move it through space, and gently place it on the ground, feeling the sensations of each part of this process from heel to toe. ...\nWalk with intention. ...\nLet yourself notice. ...\nFocus your attention. ...\nFeel your surroundings. ...\nNotice when thoughts take over. Send the thoughts telepathically to the outer-most reaches of Space. Aliens will come for you in the form of unrequited love and dreams that seem so real they make u bite your lip. Thats what this song is about.",
