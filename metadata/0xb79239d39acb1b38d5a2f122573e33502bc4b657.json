    "description": "It is like an explosion, we track the charts and look at the clock, drink alcohol at night, go crazy about what decision to make, sell or hold, and someone even thinks about giving up his usual life and starting factory work at 6:00 AM. \n\nHowever, we should remember that we are still alive and there are people who love and care about us.\n\nAnd for those who are outside of these strange NFT and crypto, I drew popcorn so they can calmly watch Crypto Weekdays madness.\n",
