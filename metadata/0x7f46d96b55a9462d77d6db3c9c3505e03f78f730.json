    "description": "A visual exploration of Black hair texture and hairstyles as interpreted by Midjourney's (v3) text-to-image algorithm. I'm interested in the algorithm's visualizations of the type 4 hair texture, which is characterized by its tight, dense, and coily strands. What does the algorithm make of the coils and twists? What does it make of the way type 4 hair can be styled in an Afro, in box-braids?",
