    "description": "A celebratory offering of 2d votivity, a grouping of queer icons from the diaspora echo homocycles - where when one begins as another ends, endlessly.\n\n'Let 'em RIP' is an obsessive collection of borrowed personas - faxed & xeroxed, ultimately collaged together - and notably made in parallel to extended philosophical exchanges with WARD5b's Greg Ellis as a repeat structure at first intended and used as a textile - but as an untimely archive.\n\n'Let 'em RIP' appeared first - in green, as a silk shirt - for Magliano's Spring Summer 2019 collection as originally created at KJSWORKS, by Klaus JÃ¼rgen Schmidt in Athens, Greece in ongoing collaboration with the brand. \n\n8268 x 8268p or 70x70cm 300dpi",
