    "description": "Up Above, the sky... A touch, a grasp, an intention...\n\nInfinite gif loop\n3D animation, analog footage, glitched and rescanned from CRT\n\n‍Stella Particula (Latin for “Star Dust”) is an art project that began in 2020 as a means of bridging eras and technologies. Emotions are an essential part of the project. Through analog and 3D technologies, Stella explores the landscapes of duality and the feelings that humans represent.\n"
