    "description": "Esalen Retreat Center is a magical and remote place on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Big Sur. I've always wanted a weekend there to photograph and meditate and do some writing and thinking about my place in the world as a photographer. However, I've never been able to afford it on my dayjob nonprofit salary. For this adventure, I will travel to Big Sur, capturing images on the way down the coast, as well as the environment of Esalen and Big Sur. \n\nBy collecting this NFT, you will also receive a 1/1 image created in or around Big Sur during this adventure, minted to your wallet in November 2022.
