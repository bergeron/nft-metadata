    "description": "Outside In is about the challenges of expressing emotions to oneself. There's an assumption that introverts are mentally stable because they process emotions internally, but it can often be even more difficult because we tend to avoid confrontation, even with ourselves. This piece is accompanied by an original score improvised by Tim Riopelle.",
