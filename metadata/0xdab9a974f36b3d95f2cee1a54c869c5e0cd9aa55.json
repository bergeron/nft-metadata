    "description": "HAPPY NEW YEAR!! 2023 is our year, fam! Let's goooo!! *in Iman Europe's voice*\n\nThis is our second drop on Sound.xyz from our duo project. The song is about the thought of a love lost & the pain that is associated with that. We wrote it a few years ago when we realized we couldn't live without each other. We released the official music video for \"Without You\" as our first NFT ever a little over 1 year ago on Zora, in December of 2021.\n\nThank you so much for listening, being a part of our journey & collecting.
