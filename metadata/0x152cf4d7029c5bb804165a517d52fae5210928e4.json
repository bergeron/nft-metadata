    "description": "# *The Calder Question* - Season 1\n\nNote: This Nonspace NFT is ready for assembly!\n\nSeason 1 of *The Calder Question* focuses on Calder mobiles. To unlock the season's NFT artworks, you must collect and properly assemble Nonspace NFTs. Nonspace NFTs are elements of a Calder mobileâ€”wires, sheets of metal, photographs, sketches, and more. They function like puzzle pieces that, when assembled correctly, unlock access to an exclusive NFT sale of the artworks. They can also be redeemed for exclusive rewards from the Calder Foundation and TRLab, including books, collectible items, and VIP access to special events.",
