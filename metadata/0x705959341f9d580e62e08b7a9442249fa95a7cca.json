    "description": "The beauty of erosion from the ocean waves striking the softened cliffs of Molokini, Hawaii. This photo was taken while on a snorkeling expedition off the coast of Maui. Despite how calm the water appears, there was actually a huge storm that day and many of the snorkelers had to be rescued by the ship's crew. Never underestimate the power of the ocean.",
