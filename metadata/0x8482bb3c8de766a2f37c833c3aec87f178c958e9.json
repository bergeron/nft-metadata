    "description": "This artwork is derived from the original “Rebirth” (2018), which is a personal project to fight against fear and powerlessness. \nTo survive in a modern world, we need to cultivate our inner strength. When the darkness comes, light guides us to move on and provides us with energy. \nIn the light, I transfer my fear of death into awe of life. I see this transformation as self-empowerment. \nHope you can immerse yourself in the cave of light and feel the energy flow. \n",
