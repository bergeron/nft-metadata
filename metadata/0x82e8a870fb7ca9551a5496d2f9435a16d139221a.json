We set out to create a synesthetic work as an alternative to watching a chart. Continually providing a (sixth) sense of price developments.\n\nThe Ethereum price updates every block from the TWAP of Uniswap's Ethereum DAI and USDC price pairs. We use an EMA derived calculation to create a sense of price volatility and directionality.\n\n\n\n### Sigils\n *remote, 2021.01.22*\n\n*digital generative real-time 3d and audio*\n\n\n*limited edition 1 of 6*",
