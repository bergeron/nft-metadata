    "description": "This Tiny Planet is from November, 2019 at the Alcázar de Segovia (Fortress of Segovia) in Spain, a castle straight out of a Disney movie! \n\nLocated in Irene’s hometown, whom I had the pleasure of meeting along with Pablo (both pictured here) when I first travelled to Germany back in 2018, the fortress served as artistic inspiration for the animated film 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' and the Cinderella castle in Walt Disney World, Florida as well as the iconic Disney logo itself.",
