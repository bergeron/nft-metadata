    "description": "There once was a guy named Sad Dude,\nWho always felt quite blue and subdued.\nHe'd sigh and he'd mope,\nAnd he just couldn't cope,\nWith the weight of his melancholy mood.\n\nSometimes he'd feel so red and hot,\nAs if his sadness was all he'd got.\nHis heart felt heavy and tight,\nAs he tried to make things right,\nBut his sadness just wouldn't be fought.\n\nSo Sad Dude went through life feeling down,\nWishing he could turn things around.\nHe tried to be happy. He tried to support,\nBut his sadness just wouldn't go away,\nLeaving him feeling like he might drown.\n\nBut then one day, Sad Dude found a friend,\nWho listened to him and helped him mend.\nThey talked and laughed and played,\nAnd Sad Dude's sadness slowly faded,\nLeaving him feeling joy and love again.",
