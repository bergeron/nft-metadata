    "description": "'Bull Market' is my Genesis on FND, and is a mixture of Digital Painting, Photography and 3D elements. I use layers of photographs, scanned textures and bold graphics to create Urban Surreal Landscapes. I am mainly inspired by the work of William Turner, WK Interact, Alexander Calder, and my everyday experiences IRL and online.\n\nRGB 11811px x 11811px",
