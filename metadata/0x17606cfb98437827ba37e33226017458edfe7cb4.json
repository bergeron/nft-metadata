    "name": "The city of Fayglen",
    "description": "The city of Fayglen was built in the middle of a scorching desert and is truly an extraordinary display of wonder. Its beauty is matched by the backdrop of everclear skies which have helped shape the city to what it is today.\nThe climate these skies brought were of great importance, but they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings have been built with lots of glass and light elements to mimic the aesthetics of the blue skies around them.\n\nThe skyline is growing with tall skyscrapers and more seem to be on their way. Science and development is flourishing in Fayglen and it has attracted a lot of attention. A few new cultures have left their mark not just on trade and relations, but also upon the city's identity. What historically was a city of plain, ordinary people has grown into a fusion of everything and it's this that unites the 7 million people to this day.\n\n4000x4000 pixels",
