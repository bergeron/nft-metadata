    "description": "A song about that ex we all have.. let's call her Helen. Remember, when you saw her & opened up, and let hell in.... Really felt like you were staying at the hell inn huh? \n\nMade this song with my friend Kyle, in the group Gianni & Kyle. So we will call him '& Kyle'\n\nKyle is also an incredible graphic designer & made the artwork/golden egg for this one.\n\nProduced by Boston\n\nLove you and thank you for listening.
