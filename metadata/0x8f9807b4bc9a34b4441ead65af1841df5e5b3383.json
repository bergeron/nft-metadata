    "description": "Metamorphosis is part of a series of digital sculptures, made entirely in 3D graphics, aiming to expand the concept of art, both from a technical and cultural standpoint. Harmony arises between processes of three-dimensional moderation, in a confrontation between \"classical\" sculpture methodologies and new digital frontiers. Sculptural matter acquires a new dimensionâ€“time. You will perceive its inexorable march, its movement, and its changing essence. You will feel like you are part of it in the understanding of what flows in, behind, and in front of you. In this NFT there is Life, Evolution, and Hope.\n",
