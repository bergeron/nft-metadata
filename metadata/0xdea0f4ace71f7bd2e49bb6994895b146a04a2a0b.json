    "description": "Since I began studying spontaneous and ambiguous painting several years ago, I have become fascinated with artists such as Johannes Vermeer, Edgar Degas, and Van Gogh. The first collection, which I call Whisper Winds of Life, is finally ready for release. In its command and resilience, wind shows a life of freedom and unrestricted living. \n\n~Artco",
