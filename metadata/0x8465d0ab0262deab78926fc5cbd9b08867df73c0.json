    "description": "Ghillie Suit (Flowers 3), 2010 \nPhotograph by Jeremy Chandler \nImage size 1600 x 1280 pixels \n\nThe Ghillie Suits are a series of constructed photographs by Jeremy Chandler. Figures are pictured embedded in a variety of terrain camouflaged by handmade camouflage garments. The images reference a spiritual and visceral connection to landscape. Jeremy Chandlerâ€™s art practice continues to grow out of a desire to express his personal history, experiences and relationships through a process that emphasizes structured improvisation with the places and people he photographs.
