    "description": "Near the city of Halflington, down Finnegan's Road, there is a small village called Wetfoot. A peaceful community, where you can hear the birds chirpin and the Orfen River running. Wetfoot is home to a small, silent, but heroic breed, called 'The Halflings'. Halflings are full of wanderlust and their next adventure is about to begin.",
