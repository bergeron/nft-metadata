Someone's scar is larger, someone's is smaller, but we will never find a person without it\n\nThe only difference is choice - in what we choose to make of our injury and how we learn to live with it\n\nWe don't choose how to get hurt. We never had that opportunity and we never will. But we choose whom to become after",
