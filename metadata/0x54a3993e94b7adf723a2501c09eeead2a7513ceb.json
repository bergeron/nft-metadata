    "description": "“Never underestimate the importance of having fun” - Randy Pausch\n\nInspired by this quote and the desire to take a step back from serious life this piece explores the concept of “fun” and how I visualise this idea. This piece is meant to lighten a room and inject an element of freedom to have fun.\n\nArt by Luke Davies\nSound Design by Aeneas \"Hardley Davidson\" Middleton",
