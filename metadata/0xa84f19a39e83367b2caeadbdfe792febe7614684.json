    "description": "A tornado-producing supercell finally escapes our grasp. We chased it for hours before we called the chase and just enjoyed the show. And what a show we were treated toâ€¦ We watched as the storm continued to rotate and drop towering lightning bolts. This process, referred to as time-stacking, aims to show just how electric this beautiful storm was. We were in awe as we peered on from across this central Illinois field.",
