    "description": "This limited edition NFT (1/1) highlights Lake Turkana, famously known as the Jade Lake from the turquoise color of its water, it sits in a broad shallow basin situated between the Ethiopian highlands to the North and Kenyan highlands.\n\nIn 1984, Kamoya Kimeu, a legendary fossil finder working for paleontologists Richard Leakey in Kenya’s Lake Turkana Basin, spotted a section of the skull on the shore of a dried-up riverbed, the Nariokotome.\n\nLake Turkana is also one of the northernmost of a series of lakes that lie in the great rift valley, the giant continental trench that runs south from Tanzania and into the Red Sea in the north. \n\nThe current lake is less than 10,000 years old. The landscape during the time of the Turkana Boy would have been much the same, except the area was much wetter. A large ancient paleolake occupied the approximate location of the current lake at the time the Turkana Boy lived in the area now known as Nariokotome.\n\nTo see the future—look at the past.",
