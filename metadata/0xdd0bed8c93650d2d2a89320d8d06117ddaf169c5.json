    "description": "The pieces used in these works are the pieces that are not actually produced as painting material, but are the pieces that are made to be used for different purposes in our daily life, resulting from the aging and disintegration of the items.\n\nOld chests, shelves, cabinet doors, shelves and worn in the interior; These are works of art that are brought together by cutting in multiples of 10 cm from unwetted, dried and petrified wooden items that have lived and expired for years.\n\nThese woods belong to various times and were collected from various places, and pictures of the period they lived on were applied to the woods.\n\nThe side accessories used on the artifacts also consist of the details of the old wooden items that fell apart. These are also included in the painting, and the woods and furniture that have exhausted their life are turned into a painting that can be hung on the wall.",
