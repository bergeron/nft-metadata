    "description": "People are born to make merit and to use old karma. This body, they allow us to live only temporarily.\n\n Everything changes with time.\n  We are born, grow up, grow old, get sick and die like the blazing sun.  When the evening comes, it's not bright.\n Don't be fooled by  The form of a body that does not exist at all  less time every day  His breath shortened with every second.  Use the remaining time to make merit.\n Wealth, money, nothing is truly ours.\n don't hold on to this life  Everything can be changed except merit and sin.",
