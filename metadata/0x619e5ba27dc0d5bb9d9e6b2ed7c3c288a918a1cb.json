    "description": "This render was inspired by an artifact from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [the Architect's Plummet](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/72300) (equivalent to a divine plumb bob) from the Pollonaruva kingdom of Sri Lanka. It's an obscenely ornate object for the function that it served, which is to survey perpendicular lines within temples; a mundane procedure rendered sacred.\n\nThe original artifact holds the face of a Chthonic deity Kirtimukha, a demon made by and through Shiva's third eye, who ended up eating itself like Ouroboros, and has since been revered as a protective deity, appearing at the door of temples and shrines as guardian of threshold. Kirthimukha has taken many forms across South, Central, and Southeast Asia, manifesting as a being that spews—from its mouth and hair—vegetation, snakes, fire, waves, or just pure uninterrupted gargantuan fangs. It is reminiscent of the Green Man, Kala, Taotie, Barong, and Vanaspati.\n",
