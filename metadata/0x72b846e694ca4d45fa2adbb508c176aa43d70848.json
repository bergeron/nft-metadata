    "description": "In the midst of the chaos, a woman stands in the void and stares into the abyss, as her deep hatred grows stronger over time. She embodies the struggles I have during my creative process. I believe that creating art is a perpetual dialogue between external and internal forces. A never-ending dance through the outer and inner realms without ever sinking into any of them.\n\nDigital\n2022",
