    "description": "i wrote this one last year in LA - at the time i was stuck in an endless cycle of arguments with someone i was seeing, and eventually realized the easiest way through was to just apologize for a bunch of things i didn’t do. \n\nit smoothed things over in the moment lol but afterwards it really wasn’t sitting right with me, and i was carrying around a lot of regret for not standing my ground more. i had a session with sam affer & jae lee a few days later and wrote this hook\n\ni hope none of you relate with this experience lol but if you do, don’t ever apologize for shit you didn’t do!!!\n\nthennnn to meet deadline for my EP (which eventually got postponed anyway lol) i went to pirate studios in silverlake and wrote the verses / produced the entire hook in a day.\n\ni tend to agonize over production choices / lyrics etc - i revisit my WIPs a lot - so being forced to make choices and commit to my initial ideas for this one was ultimately a really rewarding and new thing for me.\n\ntook a lot for me to settle on this final version, and sonically this is a big new jump for me, so i hope you love it as much as i do. xx",
