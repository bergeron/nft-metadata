But as the planet fell into its sun, a powerful and ambitious cyberpunk leader named Xander rose up against Floki, declaring himself the new ruler of Icarus.  The war between Floki and Xander and his forces, using the most advanced technology and weapons at their disposal, ravaged the planet for years. The final battle between Floki \"The Phoenix\" and Xander \"The Shadow\" was a clash of epic proportions. As the planet of Icarus hurtled towards its sun, the two warriors stood at the forefront of their respective armies, ready to determine the fate of their civilization.  \n Floki is the leader of the Icarans, a wise and just ruler who brought peace and prosperity to the land.
