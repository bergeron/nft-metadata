    "description": "Sajan Mani explores his mother tongue Malayalam  \nand its complicated cultural history. German  \nmissionary and linguist Hermann Gundert  \nstandardised Malayalam and published the  \nfirst Malayalam dictionary at the end of the 19th  \ncentury. Conversion to Christianity enabled Dalit  \npeople, who had been forbidden to read and  \nwrite, to escape repressive social hierarchies  \nand economic marginalisation. Nevertheless,  \nGundert’s work took place in a colonial context.  \nThis reflects also in the fact that archives in Europe  \nstore a multitude of materials related to Dalit  \npeople, but are difficult to access for artists and  \nscholars from India. Sajan Mani’s performance  \ncovers the space with expressive renderings  \nof original Malayalam songs, responding to the call  \nof activist and poet Poykayil Appachan’s lament:  \n“There was none on the earth to write the story  \nof my race.”  \nVideo documentation of Live Performance which was part of the 'PERFORM­ANCE FESTIVAL: The non-fungible body?' at OK Museum, Linz, 2022.  \n\nCollectors may receive a small piece of the drawing via post.",
