    "description": "Luminal Genesis is a collection of 444 alien worlds by established web3 artist, nprussell. It's a passion project, culminating from 5 months of extensive experimentation with AI art. This experimentation has led to some of the most unique AI 1:1 pieces of art the NFT world has ever seen.\n\nEach piece is a mint pass to an upcoming future Luminal project and provides a number of additional benefits which will be revealed in the near future.",
