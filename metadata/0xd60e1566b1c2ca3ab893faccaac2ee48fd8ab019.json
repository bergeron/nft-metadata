    "description": "Everyone remembers the game from childhood, when we pretended that the floor was lava and dodged in every possible way and moved to the other end of the room, stepping on chairs and other objects.\nSometimes relationships are like this game, one wrong step and they will burn out. And now already ignore you, do not answer calls and simply disappear from your life, having parted online.\n\nYou are empty.\nNow you are left with yourself and let everything burn. Floor Is Lava!",
