    "description": "Introducing \"Comedian\", the latest creation from the mischievous mind of Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan! This piece of art is simply bananas... literally! A fresh, yellow, hand-picked banana has been lovingly placed on a wall with a bit of duct tape and voila! A masterpiece is born.\n\nAnd the best part? You don't have to worry about it going bad! This banana comes with a certificate of authenticity, complete with instructions on how to display it like a boss. Two editions were sold at Art Basel Miami Beach for a bunch of bananas (aka $120,000 USD) causing a media frenzy.\n\nAccording to Maurizio, \"The banana is supposed to be a banana.\" We couldn't agree more, sometimes the simplest things in life bring the most joy!",
