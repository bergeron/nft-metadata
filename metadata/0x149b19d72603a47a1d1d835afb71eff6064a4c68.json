    "description": "THIS NFT COMES WITH AN ANALOGUE ARTPIECE\nDETAILS HERE:\nhttps://jonxsworld.apollx.io/\n\nSun is burning from the sky, the sound of waves calms you down and the beach is filled with beautiful people. It’s a mixture of the Californian surfer mentality mixed with over exaggerated status symbols.\n\nI often remembered my last trip to Venice Beach when wandering down the lonely streets during a very cold & gray Berlin lockdown.\n\nGiven being locked up I always had the need to break out and travel again. My mind was taken over by wanderlust and a piece of wood was the only possible way to express my inner feelings. All hardwares stores being closed might be also a reason I started to paint on wood.\n\nGlass is my preferred element to work with and as soon as the regular stores opened up again I had the need to transform this artwork into an object, and so I’ve captured this moment for eternity in this glass box.\n\nDetails of the analogue artwork:\nMeasurements: 40x70x15 CM\nMaterial: Glass",
