    "description": "A situation where the meaning of trust between people has disappeared in life. It turns out that mutual understanding is one way to revive a trust. However, when that doesnt happen, the result is building a relation  with wounds.\n\nThere are also many hopes that are given that turn out to be only for the sake of a mortal sense of mutual care. Everything is arranged subconsciously. The melodies that meet Auris are an alternative that is accurate enough to soothe a fragile soul. Not a few are looking for the wrong way to get a moment of peace. Many people with high integrity are end up where they shouldn't be. Hopefully life will be better by starting to plant a sense of mutual understanding and fostering mutual trust between people.",
