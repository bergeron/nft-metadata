    "description": "It took me a while to realize this. Personally, the Irish exit didn't flash its brilliance and very good friend of mine made a statement and I could pick out the word Irish exit from all He said I singled out the word IRISH EXIT, the first thing that came to my mind was an Exit door it could either be a means of escape or leave  a certain place  I too it upon my self to research what IRISH EXIT  meant definitely I was intrigued by what it meant at that point I felt I need to make a piece about it. \n           The man in the picture represents THĒ THĪÑKĒR someone who has so much running Though his mind he has to carry the problem of the whole world to carry on his shoulder, the burden of all this sometimes makes him want to take the IRISH EXIT but he still insists to remain there because he need to attend to all that needs of the world even when things don’t turn out as planned he insists on trying to find redemption and making all of it work\n\nBIDDERS EDITION\n    𝓢𝓱𝔀𝓮𝓹𝓹𝓼",
