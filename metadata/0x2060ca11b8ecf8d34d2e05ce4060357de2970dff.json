    "description": "Acrylic on canvas\n2021\n\nMag has always had contact with art. As a girl, she watched her father painting canvases and listening to records. It was only after 2007, that the streets became the inspiration for the drawings flooding her sketchbooks. Since then, her work has known no borders, decorating the streets of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Natal, Lisbon, London, and New York.\n\nHer work is marked by intuition and spontaneity. Mag is inspired by the urban euphoria of São Paulo to dive into topics that permeate Brazilian culture - her characters invite viewers to contemplate issues that surround us: faith, the profane, the ancestral, the day-to-day battle, resistance, and the feminine. Mostly known for her urban murals, Mag has also found herself in different art forms, expanding the space for artistic experimentation and research.\n",
