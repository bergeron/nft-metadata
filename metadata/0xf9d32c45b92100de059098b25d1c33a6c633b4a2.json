    "description": "Driving classic Alfa Romeos is the \"contemporary approach to the traditional mid-century Era\", as the guys from Biscioni would describe their lifestyle. But who are the Biscioni?  \nThe Biscioni refuse to be referred to as a car club, but they aim to keep alive the automotive glory years of Torino by living it. This isn't a Concourse d’Elegance: they’re jamming through gears and slinging metal frames across cobblestones. They assemble weekly at local cafes, traditional restaurants and night clubs, lounging at long tables with an endless succession of aperitifs, primi, secondi, vino and espressos, always under a cloud of smoke. And when they’re together, they create a glamorous riot of cars, clothes and watches.  \nSomeone once said: \"Visiting the Biscioni rally is less like joining a car meet, and more like stepping into a movie.\" and I couldn't agree more.\n\nNight Run  \nTurin, Italy - March 2023\n\nSize: 3648 × 5472  \nMedium: Digital  \nEdition: Open",
