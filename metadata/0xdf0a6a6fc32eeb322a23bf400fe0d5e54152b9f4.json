    "description": "It’s the little things that matter  more than we sometimes think. And quite often more than the big things in life.\n\nThese little things may seem like nothing, but they give peace, like those meadow flowers which individually seem odorless but all together perfume the air.\n\nJust small things are going to hopefully lead to a bigger surplus in the end. Obviously, you might not see it every single game, every single detail, but those small things and those small details add up so much, and that's what creates winning.  \nEnjoying those little things in life despite the bad that’s happening around because one day when we will look back and realize those were actually the most crucial and big things in our life",
