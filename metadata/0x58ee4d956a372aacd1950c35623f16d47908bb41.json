    "description": "We all come upon crossroads on our journey and are faced with choices. “Is this love?” “If I move to a new city will I find what I am looking for?” “What am I looking for?” “Should I spend the extra money to make memories or stick to buying the generic brand of toothpaste while planning for retirement?” “Was Nxb5 the best move?”\n\nInevitably we will come upon another crossroads and more choices.
