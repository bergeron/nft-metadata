    "description": "The first photo in a series that has taken up space in my mind for a long time. My (Jordantheangel_) natural, nude body in front of these enormous, manmade powerlines, captured by my partner HumanoidRhett, provides a sharp contrast of what I believe life has become. Many people are no longer heading outside to connect with nature and self, rather they are looking towards their cellular devices and media outlets on television to find solidarity in a fake digital environment that will not provide the necessary healing that nature surely does for the soul. \n\nHeal yourself and grow through nature.
