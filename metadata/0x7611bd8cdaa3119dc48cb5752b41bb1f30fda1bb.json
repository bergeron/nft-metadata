    "description": "Our creatures are proudly imperfect and incomplete.  They are filled with gaps and loose ends - AND breathing room - ROOM for growth and love and optimism and glory.  We surprise ourselves when we find the entity and can be lifted by these bubbles of time, into feeling a sense of wonder - finding movements that never existed anywhere, any place - this collection of images is a recording of the time bubble visitation - pinning chaos down.  The images are a way for us to gift the world with the findings of two creatives scratching an itch, scratching the surface and peering into what lies beneath and all around - All Of US.\n\nThis series is about pinning down a rainbow - documenting that moment when hurricanes collide and for 1/250th of a second, all is right in the world.\n\nRights Notice: The artists grant the owner of this NFT the right to display for personal use only.
