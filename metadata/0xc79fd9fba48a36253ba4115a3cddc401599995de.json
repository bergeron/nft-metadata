    "description": "In my mind, \"The Beginning\" artwork symbolizes a fresh start. Many of us may wish we could go back and restart or change certain parts of our lives, but that is not possible. Instead, we can choose to leave the past behind and start anew with a clear, dedicated mindset. That's why I chose to depict this idea through the use of the color white, representing a clean slate, and black, representing the old, chaotic mindset. The artwork is part of my Genesis collection.",
