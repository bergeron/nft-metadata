    "description": "The Wonder Wheel in Coney Island, during a sunny  day in June. Summer 2012, Coney Island, NYC. \n\nShot with vintage Polaroid SX-70 camera from 1972, on Impossible film. \n\nThis film was made by Impossible Project, back in the early days. It was tricky and unpredictable, but oh so wonderful! The pastels add to the dreamy and retro vibe, almost like a unicorn dreamworld? Anyway, this film is long gone so these photos can never ever be reproduced, which make them really unique. \n\nThe polaroids in this collection are NOT edited, just scanned on a professional scanner in high res, only some light cleaning from dust. The brown patches and tiny crystals that appear in some of the polaroids are an artifact on the originals, caused by the complicated synergy between the camera and the chemicals in the film. Most polaroid artists, including myself, consider this to be a special effect which adds to the authenticity as well as the retro look and feel of the photo, and itâ€™s quirkiness.\n\n\n\n\n",
