    "description": "A moment that felt like a dream!\n\nThree whales were resting near the sea floor : a mother, her calf and what appeared to be a one year old whale (called \"yearling\").\n\nWhen the three went up to breathe, this little guy spotted me, changed direction entirely and came straight up to me. I paddled back a little as he was getting really close, but he didn't stop until he was on me. He stayed a few seconds, then make a turn to get back to the others.\n\nIt's hard to describe how it feels when a wild animal seems so interested in interacting with you... and how peaceful you are inside at that moment.\n\nWhat a magnificent feeling to be alone underwater, surrounded by these majestic animals.\n\nAlso, I have been sort of slapped in the process, as calves are a bit clumsy with these pectoral fins!",
