    "description": "Trapped in a Bubble is a distorted reflection (like any reflection) of the philosophical concept of the limitations placed on us by the bubble in which each of us lives. We can constantly expand our horizons, but ultimately, we will always live limited by some framework—the framework of our body, of our mind, of our environment.\n\nI asked Midjourney to create an image of a clown sealed inside amber and did a few more tests until I got the result I was hoping for. I then suggested that GPT-3 write a poem about it. In my opinion, he did better than many published authors. See the result. I think it turned out to be a great song lyric.\n\nI was just a child,  \nwhen I saw it in the store,  \nI had to have it,  \nI just couldn't resist.\n\nNow it's mine forever,  \nsealed in amber,  \na scary clown doll,  \nwith a permanent smile.\n\nIt's always watching me,  \nstaring with its cold, dead eyes,  \nI can't get rid of it,  \nno matter how hard I try.\n\nIt's like it's mocking me,  \nenjoying my fear,  \nI can't escape its gaze,  \ntrapped in this hell.",
