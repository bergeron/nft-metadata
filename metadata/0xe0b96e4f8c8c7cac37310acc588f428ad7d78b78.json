    "description": "Treble clef (G-clef) The treble clef is shaped like an ornamental letter G, and its inner curve surrounds the note G4 that falls above middle C. For this reason, the treble clef is nicknamed the G clef. Many instruments—including the trumpet, violin, guitar, and oboe—read music off the treble clef. It is also used on the piano grand staff to notate music played by the right hand.\n1600*1392 mp 4 format\n10 sec.\nCinema 4d\nKeyshot 11",
