    "description": "Canimals #1 - OZ\n\nCanimals are modern day urban pixies - mischievous, adventurous and inquisitive.\nThey love to play and create innocent mayhem.\n\nCanimals can roll, stack and literally POP up anywhere.\n\nCanimals appear and act up when you’re not looking! Just like kids their age they play and share, squabble and explore, and sometimes things get out of hand.\nHumans discover that someone or something has been up to mischief, but they never find out who’s responsible.\n\nCanimals are already here but you may not have seen them?\n\nIn recognition of its novel materials and high-quality expression techniques,\nCanimals ranked second among more than 1,000 works in Mipcom Junior, France, in 2009,\nand was selected as the best animation chosen by children\nat the same venue the following year. \n\nIt also won the 2011 Korea Content Awards and the Character Presidential Award.",
