    "description": "Without knowing it, i have disturbed the Web with a video on the Evolution of humanity.\n\nThis is the story of an unexpected success. This short clip was viewed fifty million times in two days and published in many famous newspapers and even TV shows all over the world.\n\nI created this video using the Ai stable diffusion deforum tool, i wanted to create an animation with a strong visual and emotional impact, I wanted to highlight movement, the uncontrolled evolution of things, the passage of time without us being able to do anything, from the initial chaos through the final chaos.\n\nit's crazy to see how much it disturbs more than one when you read the comments and also the cultural impact it has caused.\n\nI dedicate it to all emerging artists who deserve the right recognition for their work.\n\nDuration: 00:39 sec.\n\nResolution: 1080x1920 30FPS\n\nMedium: Stable diffusion / Ai Art\n\nMusic: M83 - Felsmann + Tiley Solitude",
