    "description": "Shane Lavalette was commissioned by the High Museum in Atlanta to create a series of photographs for the exhibition *Picturing the South* which would become his monograph, *One Sun, One Shadow*. It was primarily through traditional music—the sounds of old time, blues, and gospel—that Lavalette had formed a relationship with the region. This history became a natural entry point to explore the connection between music and the landscape of the American South through images.\n\n*One Sun One Shadow* was named one of the “Best Books” of the year by photo-eye and shortlisted for the Kassel Photobook Award and the Author Book Award at Les Rencontres d'Arles. Lavalette's work has been featured by various publications, including *The New York Times*, *TIME*, *NPR*, *CNN*, *The Telegraph*, *Aperture*, *Hotshoe*, and *Foam Magazine*. Lavalette’s photographs have been exhibited widely, in addition to being held in private and public collections around the world. ",
