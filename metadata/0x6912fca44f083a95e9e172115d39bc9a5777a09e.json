    "description": "This 4K film NFT includes unlockable content â€” a star trail still photograph of this scene, for the primary buyer only. Timelapse is composed of 318 photographs. Audio by Matt Andersen.\n\nThis view in Yosemite is commonly captured, and known by many, but this moment still remains special to me. My family and I had this view all to ourselves, at midnight. We watched as the moon lit the valley like the sun and watched the fog swim through the valley floor, eventually completely covering us. Even at the time, I knew it was a unique moment, and would be a new favorite.  It's my pleasure to share this amazing moment that nature created with you all, a moment which lead me to pursue motion.",
