    "description": "This collection is the result of the days when I was bedridden as a kidney patient and was dialyzed three times a week due to my kidney failure. At home, away from my family, wife, and daughters, I was quarantined and painted my loneliness on cardboard and paper. Then Corona came and this feeling of loneliness grew, but I tried with high spirits to continue my work and to prove my lonely moments in my paintings. The work of this collection is related to the first days of my illness, which was full of pain, stress, and restlessness. The first days are full of strange and even scary dreams. In these works, I have tried to depict a part of these dreams that mostly came to me during dialysis. Our area is full of heads without bodies. these heads are cut off because of liberty and justice. these heads are dead but the thought of liberty is not dead and lives forever.\n\n\"What do you do with the inevitable growth of buds?\"",
