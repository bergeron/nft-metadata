    "description": "The image of our pleasurable ocean. The ocean is the world's beating heart. The ocean has a significant influence on weather, temperature, and human and other organisms' food supplies. Despite its enormous size and impact on the lives of all living things on Earth, the ocean remains a mystery. Humans have never mapped, explored, or even seen more than 80 percent of the ocean. The moon's and Mars's surfaces have been mapped and studied in far greater detail than the ocean floor on Earth.\n\nCreated by KIDDORIT\n\nMOV\n2880 x 3840 \nDuration 11s",
