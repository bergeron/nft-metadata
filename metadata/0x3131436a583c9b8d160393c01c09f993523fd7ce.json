    "description": "The Art is about the beginning of Sphinxies journey and adventures.\nThis is a calm time for Sphinxie now.\nNothing bothers her daily routine \nThe usual worries, the usual joys. \n\"Are you okay? - Yeah, all good.\" \n\nImagine yourself in the endless day of the groundhog. It's as if you've lowered your eyelids and stopped at the top of a hill. And the river of time flows past you, sunsets replace dawns, routine tasks never end, and the same humble joys and unresolved problems are still at home. \n\nAnd only the beat of your restless heart promises a great journey. \n\nClose your eyes, and goosebumps run down your back from the anticipation of great life events, future achievements and exciting stories.\nImagine you are Sphinxie.",
