    "description": "Vahidangelo's photography project, which was jokingly named, was influenced by Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man, shows Adam a reformed man with short brown hair and a perfected body, shows that the Spirit of God has been blown in it.\n\nhowever, Vahidangelo's project, deals with the blowing of two souls into two perfected hands, hands that are perfected together after their own perfection, and create beauties, two souls that become one.\n\nVahidangelo has been created in front of most ancient textures of Iran, from thousand-year-old tiles to the 2600-year-old palaces of Persepolis.",
