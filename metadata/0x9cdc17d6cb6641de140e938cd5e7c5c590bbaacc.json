    "description": "Collection: Secret Windows Editions\n\nArtist: Ana Julia Gobbi\n\nEdition: Limited to 30\n\nThere is nothing more striking in the black cube of the night than these rectangles of light. They flicker through the darkness, and in that moment, you are drawn into their world. You see things that are fragments of a long story, and you have no idea if what you see is a beginning, an end, or just that endless movement in between. It's a frightening but so familiar place that you run away from, and yet there it is again, on the other side of the glass.\n\n///\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to display the NFT in advertising, private and group exhibitions, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays, as long as the Creator is credited.
