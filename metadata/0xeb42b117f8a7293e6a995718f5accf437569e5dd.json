    "description": "-Warrior-\n\nThe first piece in the \"Beauty in pain\" Series, follows the transformation of a young woman who once felt ashamed and fearful of her own body, but ultimately evolves into a fierce warrior who is unapologetically proud of who she is. Her body is a powerful tool that has withstood battles and hardships that cannot be fully comprehended at a superficial level.\n\nThis series was born from her own experience with struggling to meet societal standards of beauty and battling with the effects of athletes triad. But, she has realised that her body is a work of art, a testament to her strength and resilience, and a source of pride.â€¨\n\n",
