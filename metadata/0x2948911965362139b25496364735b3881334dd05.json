    "description": "Broken Paintbrush is an immersive concept about balancing responsibilities with your passions, and the struggles that come along with your consequences. In a way, I reflected much on my own life while designing this story.\n\nWhile artwork was the only thing I was ever passionate about, there was and always will be something in my life that will make that challenging, and sometimes it all comes from the things we do every single day.\n\nThis piece was quite special to our crew too, as it was our first produced completely with continuous lighting.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it.\n\nAlyssa DeStefano is a lifelong creator, spending her time immersed in art. Lately, she's been taking inspiration from music, nature, and vintage art, and three of her pieces were used inside this piece.\n\n\nStarring: Alyssa DeStefano\nGrips: Aaqil Khoja, Joseph D.\n\nMedium Format Digital | 2022\n11565 × 8674px",
