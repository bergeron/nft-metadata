    "description": "A collection of 1000 unique dynamic pieces co-created by Refik Anadol and the community, by integrating Yawanawa natural and cultural heritage. To bring this work to life, Refik Anadol Studio devised a special computational architectural model to create a work that reflects the essence of the Yawanawa culture of deep connection with the forest, dynamically responding to real-time data influx from the Amazon. The artist Refik Anadol and project initiator Impact One are waiving their full share of the revenues, to donate the full creatorâ€™s share to the Yawanawa community.",
