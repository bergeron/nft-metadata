    "description": "Traditions are significant because they have such a good influence on our lives. People spend time together and go to locations to witness  customs such as festivals, celebrations, decorations, delicacies, and community time, learning to appreciate the positive qualities and the joy they provide to our lives.\n\nThe \"Thee Kuttichathan Thira\" is a centuries-old ritual performed on the temple grounds in northern Kerala. Photographed in my hometown of Balussery, Calicut,  in the state of Kerala, India.\n\nArtist: Dijaraj  \nTwitter: @dijaraj\n\nLicence : The NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
