The pattern of leaves is inspired by the ancient patterns which can be found in the carpets of the Ottoman period and embossed floral dishes of the Achaemenid era.\nThe chandelier brings a sense of happiness, blessing besides modernity to the atmosphere of the home. The base material is metal and is available in a combination of black and silver anodized finishing, red and blue.",
