    "description": "While I was worked in Qatar. I always prefer to roam for the frames at the late evening or in weekends for my passion. I always love to explore new places. “Msheireb Downtown” is kind of one, it’s one of d astonishing place with extraordinary architectures around, it always excites me in every frame. But photography is restricted there. The security stopped me while framing. He said very politely “My friend u can’t use tripod as well as u r not allowed to take photos here”. But I want to take the frame without the place gets crowded. But, he is very much concerned about d tripod. Then without hesitation I asked him a favor, “Would u please stand near me for 30seconds. So that, I will show the final result, if u don’t like my click I will delete the image in front of u and also I will not include any human elements in the image”, this is what I told to him to get d work done. \nHe agreed and still I remember how he was excited about the result.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: Extended Editorial",
