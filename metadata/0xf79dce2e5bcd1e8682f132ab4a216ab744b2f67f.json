    "description": "This First Generation GloCha crypto stamp is one of 25 digital collectibles created with a smart contract on mintable.app on 5th of August 2020 by GloCha founder Miroslav Polzer.. GloCha crypto stamps are a mechanism for global citizens to lead a climate righteous life by investing in the capacity of the world's youth and their communities to cope with the climate emergency. As GloCha is designed as some kind of next generation United Nations for non-state actors and has a strong momentum, it can be expected that these first generation crypto stamps will become a highly sought after digital collectible in near future. The image of the 1st GloCha Crypto Stamp shows a #GiveYouthAChance flashmob, organized by GloCha in partnership with young global climate action leaders, calling for resources for youth climate action at the UN Climate Change Conference COP22 in Marrakech in November 2016 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwjaUkmBOOM ",
