    "name": "My Heart is Ukraine",
    "description": "My heart aches witnessing the terror raining upon my homeland. This work is a hand-painted 3D sculpture (glb). It is a way to cope and to help. \n\nThe sculpture is composed of a human heart covered in markers that are drawn on civilian buildings to direct Russian missile strikes and kill innocent people. I sculpted the heart and surrounded them with bands of colors of Ukrainian flag. These I wish these bands to become protective spirits  and keep Ukrainian hearts safe and alive.\n\nAll proceeds from this work will be donated to a humanitarian fund.",
