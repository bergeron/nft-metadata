    "description": "I created this piece of digital art a number of years ago as I was exploring different forms of digital media.\n\nPictured in the image is my friend Bethany, whom the proceeds of this sale will go to.  Bethany has a particularly severe case of Crohn's disease that has had her in and out of hospitals much of her adult life.  She has every right to be mad at the hand she's been dealt, but is always just so joyful in spite of her circumstances that I find it inspirational.  \n\nShe is a blessing to everyone around her, so I am wanting to use this, my genesis piece on Foundation as a way to bless her.  100% of the proceeds, minus platform fees and taxes, will go to her.",
