    "description": "“Eyes Wide Open” is the first piece in my Genesis Collection entitled: “Outside Looking In”, as well as my first NFT! As you enter my art space, keep in mind that “the eyes are useless, if the mind is blind” as said by Mark Venturini. This piece features an edited photograph of myself surrounded by my flamboyant pink peacocks, inviting you to keep your Eyes Wide Open as you explore my imagination through the use of my digital art and photography. May this piece serve as a reminder to you and to me, to be bold and free, and to allow ourselves to be seen. This piece includes some fun unlockable content for my lovely collectors, thank you for supporting a little person in the space! To access the unlockable content please reach out to me via Twitter or Instagram (@isalartista)!\n\nThank you for stopping by and welcome to my creative space!",
