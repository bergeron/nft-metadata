(Foundation doesn't allow 100% rerouting, so 1% is going to our wallet and will be transferred manually after the auction ends. Proof will be shared on Twitter and Discord.)\n\nnotables is an art x social signalling collection, inspired by the social meta-layer construct and underlying status game of web3.\n\nnotables begins with a set of 83 genesis 1/1's on BTC (ordinals), with an associated ETH [r̶e̶d̶a̶c̶t̶e̶d̶]. notables will be the first collection to do this.\n\nThe winner of this auction also wins a special black edition from the 83 genesis 1/1's on BTC (ordinals).\n\nhttps://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x4e7bc6f6063bef3a58d46d18af91127f4aa42f10/82",
