    "description": "The Four Floors of Claws is the first Masterwork of @BabySynthetic.\n\nA piece designed entirely inside Dalle-2 from his past 5 months works.\n\nA single cohesive artwork of entirely generative images seamlessly woven together telling the story from the center outwards.\n\nCovering a variety of topics, we find our hero Niko, the cat in the center of a universe of shapes colors and sounds, all infused with iconography from his early works, and set in a future Singapore landscape where the cats are in charge, and only the new Cat Queen of Chinatown has a say in what goes on.\n\nThis 1/1 artwork was created in Dalle-2 at 10000 x 10000 px ( 1:1 aspect ratio).",
