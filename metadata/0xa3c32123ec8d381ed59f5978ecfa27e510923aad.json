    "description": "It all started in 2008 when Polaroid decided to stop the production of instant films. It wasn't profitable enough and some chemicals got forbidden in the EU for environmental issues. It was of course a big disappointment for thousands of photographers in love with Polaroid's outdated rendering.\n\nSome years later, my phone rang. Unexpectedly, it was Florian “Doc” Kaps, the founder of “the Impossible project”. His company was trying to produce new films for the Polaroid cameras. Doc told me he managed to handcraft some test films and he wanted me to shoot them. Of course, I was over the moon and accepted the challenge. \n\nWhen DHL delivered the films, I took Céline to this nice flat in Paris. I used a custom instant back onto a Polaroid 600SE camera, to be able to have a very shallow depth of field and synchronized studio flashes.\n\nI had 3 films of 8 exposures. Just 24 shutter clicks. \n\nAt the end of the day, the 24 exposures were shot. Some failed. \n\nHere are our 9 favorites.\n",
