    "description": "“During the circle moon, she would always appear in the middle of the ocean staring at the sky. At first, I was so curious: who is she, where is she from, what is she? It would be several years of watching her before I learned about the other Drakami (Dragon Spirits): Earth, Fire, & Water. She would be my first encounter.”  \n“I’ve always sensed a presence watching me during the circle moon. Growing up, I would rarely go to the surface, but it was the only way I could see the moon’s true beauty. I would hear tales of the Air Drakami, entitled beings who flew around in the sky like the world was their playground, but he was different.”",
