    "description": "Sewer Shark is paying homage to one of my favorite videos on the Sega CD gaming system back in the 90s. The base version is a 1920 x 1920 60fps space ride through a futuristic corridor in space. The 1/1 winner will get a 2160 x 2160 60fps special edition of the NFT which enhances the visuals and has several elements in the ship react to the original audio which is also enhanced from the original.",
