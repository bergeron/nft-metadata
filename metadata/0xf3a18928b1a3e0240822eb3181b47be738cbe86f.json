    "description": "The ashamed sinner covers his face trying to hide from his own judgment. The light that hovers over everything and everyone touches his clothes and skin like a light breeze. Not to judge, but to forgive his actions. Because the sinner's heart is repentant, body and soul, and what was done long ago will never happen again.\n\nMedia Dimension: 3400px x 3116px",
