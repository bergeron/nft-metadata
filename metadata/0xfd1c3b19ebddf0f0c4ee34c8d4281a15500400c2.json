    "description": "My paternal grandma's name was Sarah. Our family believes that her spirit attached to me after she passed. During the pandemic, I like all of us, started a powerful self discovery journey and she kept coming to me in my dreams. Our Aunt, who currently lives in South Africa told me Sarah spoke to her about me. This piece manifested from what we believe she was communicating to us. It happened during the super bloods moons we all witnessed in 2021. This celebrates the spiritual connection between black women and their female ancestors and the bond it creates once we begin the journey to learn about who we really are. ",
