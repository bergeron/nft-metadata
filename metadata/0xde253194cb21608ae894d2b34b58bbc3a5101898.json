    "description": "This lake is located in Meshkin Shahr highland, which is 3450-meter altitude and named Aygar lake (Samad Goli). Because of the high altitude, there is snow even in the hot summer season around the lake. In the summertime, there is a good opportunity to go there with off-road vehicles or mountain climbing to enjoy perfect cool weather.",
