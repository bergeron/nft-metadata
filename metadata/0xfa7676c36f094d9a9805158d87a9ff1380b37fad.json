    "description": "“Before You” will be angelbaby’s second official single off his upcoming album “Clio” and his 5th official Music NFT. \r\n\r\n  This song was chosen by Hume Genesis holders after watching season one of Hume’s episodic series “Worlds Apart.” Throughout the season we got to experience the early days of angelbaby and Clio falling in love, and feel the heartbreak that inspired angel to write this song “Before You.” Read the message below from angelbaby. \r\n\r\n “it's hard for me to even remember who i was before clio. there are so many things i would ask her if she was here. holding her in my arms after the bombing, screaming her name, i saw my whole life flash before me. im sure youve all had someone you loved that gave you purpose. i want you to imagine that person when you listen to this.” \r\n\r\n we are hume. we are many. \r\n\r\n wearehume.com",
