    "description": "A collection of photos taken by UglySteffy over a 2 year span of time. Love for the windy city’s beautiful skyline was all that was needed to hold together a strong passion for photography. A climb and walk across an unstable fence achieved a better high ground for a sexy, unforgettable view.  This collection has a bittersweet taste, as many memories of love and pain come with it. Amazing new friendships, sleepless nights, loss of self worth, heartbreak, self destruction, self improvement, bad habits, good habits, and many, many more moments. This location was a beautiful way to include many friends—old and new—in experiencing the love and excitement that climbing and exploring provide. 1117 and this view helped everyone out of their comfort zone, and will be a place forever cherished.",
