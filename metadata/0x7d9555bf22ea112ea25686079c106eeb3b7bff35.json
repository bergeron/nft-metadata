No hidden cost & you do not have to burn any tokens to redeem the physical. \n\nIf you are not comfortable providing a personal mailing address at this time, please consider an alternative option, such as having it delivered to a Friend/Family/Dropbox.\n\nContact @P22535 directly on Twitter to provide an address. \n \nSYZYGY (1) token holders may also experience our Oncyber.io gallery:  \nhttps://twitter.com/P22535/status/1620080499090944000\n\n** Resale of any token from the SYZYGY (1) collection is not recommended at this time as it may not include a physical carving by P22535. Secondary listings should be considered as \"NFT ONLY\" & buyers beware.\n\nINSPIRATION: \n@Mist8kofficial, @Muratpak, @ALCrego_",
