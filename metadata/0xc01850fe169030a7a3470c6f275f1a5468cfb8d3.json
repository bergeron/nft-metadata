    "description": "Higher ONE1  \nThe first still from a video animation from my 'HIGHER ONE' serie. Higher One is an exhibition that will take place in various places around the world and times in the coming six months. \n                      \nThe primal source of light reflects in a variety of forms. Zooming in on the cell structure, the deep infinity of the lens, the enchantment of stillness. Out of the chaos of millions of rays. In whatever form the touch with the light brings up a memory .  \n\nClifton Mahangoe, Light Artist: We are a part of creating that which we behold. Touching with light, from the smallest molecules of the earth to the patterns in the universe and through technology to the core of our human hearts is a grounding and expanding experience. Light is the most multidimensional instrument I can play with and uncovering the depths of itâ€™s layers technically and spiritually is the essence of my work. It is a passing journey of remembrance and a form of art in service of a the greater good",
