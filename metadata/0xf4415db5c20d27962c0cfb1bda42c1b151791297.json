    "description": "Evolution is futile, after our beloved town of St-Huffington had been wiped off the map by the Dudley twins’ intergalactic God complex, something peculiar started happening… from the radioactive grounds, came strange misshapen knuckle dragging creatures.  Violent and horny by design, feeding off an uncanny diet of leftover plastic bags and paint fumes, they are now the sole inhabitants of what’s left of this toxic wasteland. Reminiscent of Sodom and Gomorrah, they have built a society where anarchy and debauchery reign…  they say history repeats itself but this is a whole other level, the paint huffing degenerates are living a lifestyle that would make Caligula turn over in his grave. Welcome to New Huff city, we recommend you wear a helmet and bring some pepper spray.",
