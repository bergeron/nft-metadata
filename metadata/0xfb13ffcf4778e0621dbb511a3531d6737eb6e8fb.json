    "description": "The \"Meta Lesbian dating Zora Drops\" NFT collection is a thought-provoking exploration of gender questioning, using AI as a central issue. It seeks to challenge and provoke new reflections on society and what we teach machines.\n\nLea Arafah's approach in this collection is through depersonalized meta-erotism. Meta-erotism refers to the exploration of desire and sexuality in unconventional ways, transcending established norms and conventions. In this context, the depersonalization of eroticism aims to highlight gender as a fluid and mutable element, detached from predefined notions of identity.\n\nThe NFT artworks in the \"Meta Lesbian dating Zora Drops\" collection feature abstract and symbolic visual representations of gender questioning. They explore the intersection between desire, identity, and AI, challenging conventional notions of sexuality and relationships.\n\nIn summary, the \"Meta Lesbian dating Zora Drops\" collection is an artistic expression that uses NFTs to explore gender questioning, the relationship between AI and society, and challenges established norms through depersonalized meta-erotism. It invites deep reflection on how we shape machines and how machines can help us rethink and reconstruct notions of identity and desire in our society.",
