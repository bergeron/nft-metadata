    "description": "Sometimes we have to accept the reality and admit that we have made some mistakes which have taken us away from light and lead into darkness.\nMistakes that, like a double-edged sword, discolor our souls and annoy us from within.\nI used 13 swords in this work\nContrary to popular belief, the number thirteen is the symbol of the beginning of a new era. We can learn from our sins and build our new world.\nIt's not too late. With awareness, perseverance and courage, we can mark a new era in life.\n--\nTechnique: A combination of photography, painting and digital techniques\n--\nsize:5475px Ã— 5313px\n",
