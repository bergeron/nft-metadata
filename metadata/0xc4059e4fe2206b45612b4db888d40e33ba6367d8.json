    "description": "This work is a projection of the subconscious mind, threading together the dream world with reality.\n\nThis piece is heavily inspired by Tears, a famous print by the Surrealist, Man Ray. Man Ray explores the artificiality of art making by photographing a mannequin with glass bead tears - fooling the viewer into thinking itâ€™s an image of a real woman.\n\nAI allows for a similar illusion. A questioning of the real and unreal. An ability to see across time and space. \n\nWayfinder | 2023"
