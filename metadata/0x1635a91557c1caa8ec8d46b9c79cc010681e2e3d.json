    "description": "The ALIENCELL, The Alien NFT Collection. \n\nIt is a large mass of living tissue, or \"CELL\", from a powerful alien leader, whether it originally comes in a certain unique form or was obtained from the owner's body.\n\nThe cell may even appear in different forms as a boss in some games, whether it is used by someone by merging with it in order to obtain supreme power, or used to fuel a powerful war machine, or even fought by itself.\n\nNot surprisingly, something as powerful is prone to attract attention, and as such, many different organized groups have wanted to get their hands on it, whether it is for studying it and release all of its potential for military purposes, or to secure supreme leadership, or for their own selfish purposes, or even to take it away from the wrong hands.\n\nThe cell can even be connected to and fuel war machines with its power. However, it is known to be very unstable, and if not contained in the right conditions it may mutate and attack by itself.",
