    "description": "On August 13, 2018, I drove hundreds of miles to capture an extraordinary shot.  Throughtout the afternoon, I'd drive from mountain to mountain in southern Arizona watching as an outflow boundary would create another pulse thunderstorm over the peaks.  But time and time again the storms would disappoint me and produce little to no lightning.  Finally, near the end of the day, I took a chance to drive near the Arizona/ New Mexico state line for a chance to see a thunderstorm pop up over the Chiricahua National Forest.  As the storm drifted over me and into the valley to my east, a dazzling rainbow appeared and I captured this shot of a lightning bolt parallel the double rainbow.  I was soaked to the bone after this but didn't care.  I knew I'd caught a rare moment. Alone in such a remote area with no cell signal, I danced in the rain and celebrated the moment with the desert plants and animals that desperately needed this rain.  ",
