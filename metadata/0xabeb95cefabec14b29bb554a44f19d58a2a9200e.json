    "description": "Okhara, with its history and memorial of my grandfather, became a safe place for my daydreaming. I lived there for six years there, and it was a wonderland to me. It was an autonomous republic that I conquered without any war. A place where my childhood images and memories are still happening there: Weddings, snow, fog, cloudy sky, children, adults, and children.",
