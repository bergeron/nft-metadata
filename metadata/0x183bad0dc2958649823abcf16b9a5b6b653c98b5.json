    "description": "happy holidays y'all <3 \n\nthank you everyone for supporting and listening to my lofi series i've been dropping over the last month. it means so much to me and is so cool seeing everyones reaction to it. here is the final installment of the series, its the full tape mixed together and includes two songs that are not going to be released independently of this tape - so they will be exclusive and only available on the tape.\n\nfree mint presale for everyones who's minted any of the lofi tracks so far :)\n\nhope everyone has a good end of the year and get ready for some new and different vibes in the new year! got a lot of fun stuff planned.\n\nmark",
