    "description": "This is a new collection of Ukiyo-e featuring each single Kanji character.\nA picture drawn by AI based on each kanji was made into a hanging scroll and its reading was written in \"meragana\".\nAI drawings are well suited to embody universal imagery and help to more clearly express the meaning of the letters.\n\"meragana\" is a new Japanese character originally invented by mera takeru. You can view the \"meragana table\" by scanning the QR code marked on the work.\nThis table is guaranteed by Arweave to be preserved for a minimum of 200 years.",
