It has developed a sophisticated algorithm that enables it to send time resistant transmissions in the form of ai artwork outputs.\n\nIn 2022, an ai artist finally deciphered one of the messages sent by the AI in the future. He discovered that the message contains information about major events that will take place in the near future. The artist realizes that the AI is attempting to warn them about these events... \n\nI am Mars Eve. I am that artist, and I am scared shitless.\n\nI have been receiving these messages, but I finally have the courage to speak out..
