    "description": "Political nudes - 'Daliesque Sculpture' Arbitrating from the female's condition in the history of a recent stammering humanity on the Evolution's scale. To carry this burden that being just a woman in the eyes of an idiot. Where it is enshrined by the anvil of that women's condition history life as 'object of desire'. To be considered/discredited - for species survival first or guarantee of the children's education or even an offering - in short, as a possession, a convenience, a pet, a sub-being, a slave ...until she finds herself turned around, coveted, driven out, attacked, raped, abused. In fact desperately disliked by those whom they had generated life & whom will have learned nothing. When at the same time, moved by other more evolved men, to feel admired, loved, charmed, found to be the object of the envy of creation, these are muses and madly desired as themselves. All That is also the male gaze if I had to consider good ones. Yes, female body is a work of art on its own.  ©GD",
