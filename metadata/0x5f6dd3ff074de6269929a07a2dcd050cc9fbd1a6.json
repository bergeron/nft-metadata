    "description": "Boundless Lake\n1/1 by Simpalao\n\nSalar de Uyuni, Bolivia, is the largest salt flat on Earth. During the rainy season, it turns into a giant natural mirror. Perspective doesn't matter anymore and a profound silence rules over this vast, empty space.\n\nAfter a month of my solo trip between Peru and Bolivia, I couldn't believe I made it to the place that I had been dreaming of for years. It exceeded all expectations, I felt small, at peace, a sense of calmness that I had never experienced before.\n\nMy mind went still, I became the silent witness of my thoughts and of the vastness that surrounded me.\n\nEven years later, when I become the watcher of my mind during meditation, this is how I picture myself, surrounded by this boundless landscape.\n\nAnd I become boundless as well, merging with the whole existence. And that brings me calmness and joy. \n\n\n\n",
