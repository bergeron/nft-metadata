Each mask is my vision of a future symbolic representation of strength and determination worn by a different person from day to day struggling with mental health. A running feature in this collection is the use of metallic paints. All works are hand painted and limited to 1 of 1. \nThere will never be another. \nEach piece is signed by myself. \nEnjoy living.
