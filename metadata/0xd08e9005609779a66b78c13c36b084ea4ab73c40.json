    "description": "The human mind is complex, strong, and fragile. Some are bright and wrapped withered at the same time. I created this art with those complex and unstable feelings. It frees my soul and calms me like a sleeping cat, and was ready to come back crazy again and over again. There is no end in these feelings. Just have to understand and stay with them.",
