    "description": "This drawing has used various different types of machine learning which have then been passed through a further series of image making techniques  to include or exclude new information and datapoints. As Lorraine Dalston writes, each image, no matter how scientifically rendered contains “traces of consequential choice about knowledge, persona and collective sight”. \n\nThe initial sale will also include the physical plotter drawing this image is a scan of, as well as a digital SVG file so that, if desired, further illustrations can be made and experimented with, and questions whether any image can truly be objective. \n\n",
