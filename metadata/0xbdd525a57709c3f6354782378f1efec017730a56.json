    "description": "Hugs on Tape satisfies a visceral need for physical contact in the pandemic era. We wanted to distribute Hug Simulations that can share bursts of joy and intimacy. We sent a call out to friends and family requesting recordings of hugs with someone in their pod. The recordings captured tenderness and love among those spending more time than ever together, and a choreography of closeness inside the familiar frame of video, animation, and Zoom calls. The series is created with tools ranging from handmade audio/video synthesizers to smartphones and digital animation software.\nAll the patterns and colors in Hugs on Tape are made exclusively with hardware, analog synthesizers and other analog instruments. Although some were found or borrowed, LoVid’s handmade synthesizers are the primary instruments used in LoVid recordings for over a decade.",
