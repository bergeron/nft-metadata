    "description": "While other mixed drinks pre-date the Old Fashioned, the \"Old Fashioned Whisky Cocktail\" is considered the original cocktail as featured in the first known definition of the word, published on May 13, 1806. A concoction with component parts of spirit, sugar, water, and bitters, the Old Fashioned was said to be ‘useful for \"electioneering\"—persuading people to vote in favor of the party that bought the drink.’ The classic cocktail has been remade and reimagined several times throughout the centuries, many becoming classics in their own right. At Penicillin, the team uses a clear bourbon whiskey, orange, and angostura bitter in their take on this modern classic. Penicillin's Clear Old Fashioned paired with a cigar is the go-to for Artifact Labs Co-Founder Henry Chan.",
