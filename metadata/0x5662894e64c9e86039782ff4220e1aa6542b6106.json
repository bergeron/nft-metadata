    "description": "ANSWERS\nPt. 5/5 (Answers EP)\n\n‘Answers’ came to me unexpectedly one summer morning at 2 am. I was in a trance, playing the chords repeatedly until the lyrics seemed to write themselves. It felt like the words were given to me before I fully understood them. At that time, I had been reflecting on the idea that our reality could be part of a grand experiment, a giant holographic pulse. Everything I was reading and listening to seemed to hint at this concept. The purpose being to disconnect us from the truth of who we are, through the limitations of the human body, societal programming, and cycles of suffering, to see if we remember. But what do we remember? I believe the answer can never be expressed in words. It's a felt sense that we all glimpse from time to time. At the deepest level, I think we have all, at a soul level, agreed to be part of this game, not to seek escape, but to fully immerse ourselves in every facet of it, knowing that it is, in fact, just a game.\n\nWritten & produced by ALYSS\n\n\n♅\n\nWe don't even know why we're here\nIn a land of limitation why we here\nWas it made by those above who don't care?\nWas it planned by ones who love, ones who care?\n\nI'll keep waiting for answers\nI'll keep waiting for answers\nI'll keep waiting for answers\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n\nMemories that always come when you're near\n(When you're near)\nHow we always endure pain we fear\n(Pain we feel)\nIf we took another road, what's the worst?\n(Would it be the worst?)\nIf we played another game, would we learn?\n(I'll keep on waiting)\n\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n(I'll be waiting)\nI'll keep waiting for answers\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n(I'll be waiting)\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n\nWe're being asked to stop living from the mind and the ego\nAnd to start living from the heart once again\nAnd all we are asked to do is be love\nWhen you live from love, everything changes\nWith love, you remember who you are\nWith love, you do not judge anyone else\nBy being love, you change the world consciousness\nFrom mind to heart\nLove really is the answer\n\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n(I'll be waiting)\nI'll keep waiting for answers\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n(I'll be waiting)\nI'll keep waiting for answers\n",
