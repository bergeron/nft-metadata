    "description": "The Hornocal Mountain range is located 25 KM from the city of Humahuaca in Jujuy, Argentina. This range is part of the limestone formation named Yacoraite that extends from Salta, Argentina through the Bolivian Altiplano and up to Peru. \n\nThe peaks of the mountains reach an altitude of 4,761 meters (15,620 ft) above sea level.\n\nIn 2003 this was considered as part of the world´s heritage due to the Qhapac Ñan (Inca Road) and the colorful and impossible patterned mountains.\n\n\nThis landscape often described as impossible displays a phenomenal geometric pattern through its layers, this is truly a mesmerizing place.\n\nThis vertical 8 photograph stitched composition reassembles the totality of my perception on this wide landscape. This is a place I will definitely return to spend the night and spend hours just contemplating the scenery.\n\n23208 x 5463 Px\n",
