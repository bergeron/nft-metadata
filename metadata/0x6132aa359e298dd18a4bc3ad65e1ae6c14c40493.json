    "name": "Life and death",
    "description": "Death was always fascinated by color. He loved the way it could brighten up the bleakest of days and add life to the most mundane of tasks. Even though he himself was without color, he didn't begrudge those that had it.\n\nOne day, death came across a field of wildflowers in full bloom. The vibrant colors were so beautiful that death couldn't help but admire them. As he looked at the flowers, he noticed one that was starting to wilt and fade.\n\nAlthough he had seen this happen countless times before, it never ceased to amaze him how something so full of life could so quickly turn to death. He wondered if that's what his own existence was like - a brief moment of color in an otherwise dark and dreary world.",
