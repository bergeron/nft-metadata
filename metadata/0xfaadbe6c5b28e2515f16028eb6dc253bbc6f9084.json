Each NFT is a unique piece, and the total collection consists of 200 NFTs. Each NFT has 12 physical print editions. (ED10,AP1,EC1)\n\nIn 1980, video artist Nam June Paik named the remote-expression, energy-free way of life the Stationary Nomads, and since 2020, post-corona humanity has been accidentally approaching the Stationary Nomads. This collection is about nudity and physicality in order to reconsider the changes that are taking place in our time: a body that is detached from materiality and excessively dressed up by avatars and icons in digital space.\n\nNakedness and Materiality #1\n5844 × 9499 in JPG format,\nYoichi Ochiai, 2022\n\nModel: Kurumi Narazaki",
