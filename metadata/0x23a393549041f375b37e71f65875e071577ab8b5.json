    "description": "Whiteout is an image I took earlier in my photography career, right around November of 2020. \n\nThis hike was done in early winter with about a foot of snow and our group of 4 had little to no experience hiking in the snow. No poles, no spikes, nothing to help us out. \n\nWe had the plan of going up to the top of this trail for my friend to propose to his fianc√© which although became successful, it made for an overall miserable experience. \n\nWe look back and laugh at it today. It made for a funny experience and still some of the best images I have taken.",
