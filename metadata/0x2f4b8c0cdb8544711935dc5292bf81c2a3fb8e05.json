    "description": "\"Time Table\" started 1st November 2022, finished 27th January 2023.\n\nThe first work of a new era for me discovering the multichain network. \n\nFeaturing pictures I shot of textures on the wall, lighting in the night sky, the sun, roots of plants and graffiti. \n\nCreated with several Softwares and apps to manipulate images, paint and build upon those, add layer after layer, re-run it through my sort apps, scale grain and put every yet so little dot where it felt it belongs.
