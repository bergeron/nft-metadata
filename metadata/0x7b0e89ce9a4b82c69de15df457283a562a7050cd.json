    "description": "This painting was created under impression of a trip to Altai. I climbed higher and higher on foot. 7 Karakol lakes followed one after another - from the lowest, first, to the highest, smallest and coldest. I was surrounded by mountains, tiny (and tasty) waterfalls and the wind of freedom",
