    "description": "\"And Ye said, Let there be light: and there was light.\" \n \n Now more than ever, to merely believe in something is to fulfill its prophecy. Nowhere is this better exemplified than by the NFT, a machine that translates hype into concrete value via code. Brought to you by the minds behind the 2015 viral phenomenon, The Book of Yeezus, The Books of Ye is the first conceptual art NFT. The Books of Ye is designed by a collective of over a dozen award-winning 2D and 3D artists and creative coders, and explores the novel power dynamics brought on by an era in which hype has arisen to become the preeminent currency: Those who make believe make reality. Art is the utility. Owners of a BoY asset enjoy access to a series of upcoming original artistic experiences, both in the virtual and real worlds, the first of which are the boutique viewing rooms for viewing one's asset, allowing users to read a foreword elaborating on the concept, and hear an original \"bardcore\" soundtrack; as well as an original AR experience. Much more to come.",
