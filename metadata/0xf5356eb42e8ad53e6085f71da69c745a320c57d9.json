    "description": "Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities and is an innate tendency of human psychology. Anthropomorphic images, cave paintings depicting part human, part animal figures are among the oldest works of art created, dating back 32,000 years. The Navajo refer to the ability to take the form of an animal as shapeshifting. Globally, cultures have stitched the anthropomorphic tendency into the fabric of their sacred stories; a talking snake in the Garden of Eden, and Horus, a tutelary deity often depicted as a falcon-headed man, for example. The idea of animals having conscious thoughts, experiencing love and heartache is vilified within many congregations of belief as some humans do not wish to be inclusive with their concept of experiencing the divine. Perhaps one motivation for this exclusivity is studies have shown that individuals who attribute human characteristics to animals are less willing to eat them. ",
