    "description": "This artwork is a study for the painting \"unknown samples (areal.collect(3))\" - AV-2021-U-107, shown for the first time in 2021 during the Opus Sectile exhibition at darmo & Gismondi gallery in Paris, France.  \nAs part of an experimentation with the collectors, during the assembly of the frames, portions of \"seed phrases\" of wallets were hidden behind each of the 22 paintings. \nDuring a dedicated performance organized by aur√®ce vettier the following year, the collectors decided if they wanted to pool their respective words to collectively gain access to these studies, and determined the rules for \"sharing the spoils\".\n\nRef: AV-2021-U-107-S",
