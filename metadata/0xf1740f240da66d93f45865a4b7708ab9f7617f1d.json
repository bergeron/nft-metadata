    "description": "I was visiting the newly opened mist park in Istanbul.\nI was very impressed with the excitement, joy and running of the children while the artificial fog system was working in the mist park.\nBoth the play of light and the visual richness seemed to have been prepared for these photographs.\nThe visual effect of the fog was truly mesmerizing.\nTaking advantage of this magical moment, I created this collection.\n\nMy photograph named \"Children\" in this collection won the Photo Competition Open Category Special Encouragement Award among 65,062 photographs by 26,167 photographers in the NIKON PHOTO CONTEST 2020/2021 competition.\n\nhttps://www.nikon-photocontest.com/en/awards/2020/open_photo/art_05.html",
