    "description": "Web unites in an unforeseeable way.\n\nChoices we make affect others as we all share parts of this web when coming across one another in this thread-like world.\n\nInterconnectedness of the Web transcends dimensions â€“ each piece of it belongs to every other piece. \n\nWe are all individuals in our own homes,  weaving a way through our own life and we make decisions that affect how things will turn out for everyone. \n\nOur home is the place where  it all happens.\n\nGoing out into the world alone can seem terrifying but is necessary just like spiders first steps across an empty space.  When we  step  into the space of nothingness - everything is being created .\n\n\nMay webs that we weave need not be sources of entanglement, but a network of roads to travel.\n\n\n\n5000 x 6500 pixels, \ndigital painting, made with Procreate\n",
