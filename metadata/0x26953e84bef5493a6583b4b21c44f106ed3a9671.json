    "description": "“Dream Hotel,” the new song from Grammy-nominated songwriter, singer, actress and businesswoman Tayla Parx, premieres today via her own TaylaMade Records. Co-produced by Parx, Oliver Frid and Heavy Mello with lyrical contributions from Lara Andersson, “Dream Hotel” is the third track revealed from her upcoming project, Many Moons, Many Suns. \n\n “I wrote this song on a couch in Nashville, clumsily finding the right chords and words that matched the way I was feeling at the time,” recalls Parx. “The Dream Hotel is a real hotel in New York City and I’ve had so many crazy memories there, one of them being where me and my ex broke up. This song reflects on those moments in that room on that night and the growth I experienced in the many difficult months after. Sonically, it’s one of my favorite songs I’ve released yet.” ",
