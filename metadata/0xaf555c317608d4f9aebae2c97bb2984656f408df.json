The Hamburg native established a reputation in journalism with well-founded travel reports. Picture books about the Danish Baltic Sea island “Bornholm“ and “Südschweden – Eine Reise durch den Göta-Kanal“. Books and calendar productions about “Paris“ including for the airline Air France are examples. In countless photographs taken over decades in Paris, Stephan Gabriel documents his love for the French metropolis with his very personal view. Fascinated by the diversity of this extraordinary metropolis, his wonderful pictures portray the city on the Seine with a lot of heart and understanding. His works can also be found in various exhibitions in Cologne, Munich, Hamburg and Paris as well as with numerous publications in newspapers and magazines.",
