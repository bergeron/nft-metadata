    "description": "I have been thinking of what else I can do about the disaster that my country is going through. So all the income that can be obtained from this work called \"Hope\" will be transferred to the social responsibility projects for the earthquake zone, down to the last penny. \n\nWe must maintain our unity and our solidarity, not for now but until the cities and earthquake victims recover and afterwards. It's time to obtund the pain and keep hopes alive. Our future will be shaped by our hopes; not by pain.",
