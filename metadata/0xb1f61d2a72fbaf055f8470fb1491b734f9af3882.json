    "name": "Eddie Vedder, Pearl Jam, Fenway, Boston, 9/2/18",
    "description": "\nRight there, in that moment, less than nine minutes into the show, I could tell he was taking it all in, the fans and signs and the Green Monster in the late evening glow, and even after all this time as a star up on stage, still in overwhelming awe of his dreams having come true. Truly a portrait of a mature artist. \n\nTo get the photograph, I let the dozen other local photographers scrum under Eddie's nose as I stepped to the far side of the stage. An old trick of mine - I knew I was shooting the whole show, and they weren't, so I'd go and look for something different to begin with. \n\nTaken with a Nikon digital camera and 70-200mm lens at the long end, the photo is exactly as shot, full frame, only converted to b&w and adjusted for density. It's also a real testament to the quality of Pearl Jam's lighting crew, without whom I couldn't have made it. And of course not without that handsome, talented subject there in front of me. Thanks Eddie. \n\n",
