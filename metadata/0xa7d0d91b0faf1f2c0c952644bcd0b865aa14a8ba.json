    "description": "This is a brand-new series of artificial intelligence Art inspired by bible story. This collection artworks 100% using Hahnemühle authentic Fine Art paper with a floater wooden frame design by ArtOne Studio.   Inspiration: I just love the bible story ‘The Ark’. It is the perfect story to emphasise GOD hates all sin and loves all people. When He looked down upon the beautiful world He had made and saw His beloved people killing and beating and mocking and stealing from each other, “His heart was filled with pain.” He peered into their hearts and saw that their thoughts were bent on evil all the time. Grieved that the people He had made were so full of wickedness and violence, God wiped the slate clean by destroying every living thing not on the ark (Genesis 6:5-12). Until today, God still provides a way for us to begin again with Him through the covenant.",
