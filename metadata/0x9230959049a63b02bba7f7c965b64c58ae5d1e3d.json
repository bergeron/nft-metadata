    "description": "This location was extremely difficult to find. I had heard rumors of this magical place somewhere in the Valley of Fire, but it required significant hiking and general feelings of incompetence while I was sweating through a liter a minute. Several bottles of water later, I finally found my way inside.\n\nNow there is something that may be a bit disappointing about this place. Do not read on if you don't want to be disappointed...\n\nIt looks quite large and cavernous, if you will, but it is actually quite small and tight. I had to squeeze through a little hole and wriggle my way inside. In fact, my tripod was almost too big to fit inside even on its shortest setting so I had to take it apart a little bit to get a steady shot. Anyway, sorry about the disappointment. I also like the idea of a huge cave hollow-earth hoaxathon that is home to mysterious desert creatures.\n\nValley of Fire, Nevada"
