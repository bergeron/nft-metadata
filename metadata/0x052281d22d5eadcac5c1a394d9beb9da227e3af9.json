    "description": "The first in my series of mixed media pieces combining photographs taken in rural UK with digital drawings done on iPad with Procreate. Everything is hand drawn or photographed by myself.\n\n6000x4000px image with 200px border, suitable for high resolution printing or as a desktop background, etc. Buyers can also receive the photograph and drawing layers as separate high-res images for use in profile pictures, etc.\n\nThis is my first NFT project so your support is greatly appreciated. The proceeds from any sales will be used to fund a larger NFT project that I'm currently working on.",
