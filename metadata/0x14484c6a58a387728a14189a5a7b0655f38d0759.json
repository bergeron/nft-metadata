    "description": "Curators Society is the premier metaverse club. It is a place for entertainment, for extraordinary events, for friendship; it’s a place to experience the best that web3 has to offer, and in the finest company. Come connect with other web3 citizens who are shaping the diverse fabric and energy of the decentralized world.\n\nHolders of the Founders Pass are entitled to all of Curators Society’s most valuable utility, but are secondary memberships vs. our Genesis Curator NFT holders’ primary memberships. Founders Passes do not have governance rights to the Genesis vault and will have limited “Club within a Club” benefits.",
