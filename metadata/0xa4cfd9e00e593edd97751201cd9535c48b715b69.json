    "description": "Channeling his love of metal, grunge, hip hop, and electronic music, SLOE JACK’s approach is off the chest, in your face, and totally supercharged. Impossible to manufacture, the music captures the visceral release of pain essential to the healing journey. It’s raw, aggressive, and reverberating with deep humanity.\n\nHere’s how SLOE JACK describes his latest track:\n\n“Money & Fame” is a mosh pit banger for the people. “In web3 you can drop tracks that probably wouldn't be released,” says SLOE JACK. “That's what's perfect about it.”\n\n----\n\nThis is the fifth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
