    "description": "This art opens a collection of people and totem animals. Here is me (the artist) and my animal deer. Peonies on art are tattoos that I once beat. The deer is my totem animal, it is kind, strong in spirit and with big naively open eyes. The Northern Lights and spruce branches are the place where I grew up (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug-Yugra), where frosts are up to -45. The ornament on the deer's forehead is a symbol of the taiga.",
