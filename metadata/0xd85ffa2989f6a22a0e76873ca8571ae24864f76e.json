    "description": "An exclusive feature collection of 3333 ethereal avatars. For centuries, the Stygians have restricted all access to the lands above. Dwellers possess unique psychokinetic abilities, 200+ MMORPG-inspired traits and a collective knowingness that they will escape the labyrinth of deception that we call life. Each Dweller shares the same grim reality, but differ in their mental conditioning and methods of conjuring the light.",
