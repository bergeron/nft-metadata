    "description": "Thereâ€™s an unusually large number of child laborers coming from the Banjara community in Rajasthan, northern India. The banjara people are a nomadic community in India. The unstable environment of high poverty and continual migration has created a breeding ground for criminal activity including human trafficking and forced child labor. And we can all do something together! Support Banjara community, and utilize your crypto assets to build a future with financial inclusion. The first 280 donors will get an impact certificate in the form of an NFT, with artwork painted by the children of the Banjara community. And the top 100 donors will get an impact certificate sponsored by Fox of Utopia.",
