    "description": "Eyes Yonder series 4 includes 59 pieces of digital art. This series is distinctive for its tightly packed geometric shapes grouped into multiple layers, depth-of-field effects, and thread-like curves that weave throughout.\n\nTen pieces from series 4 (#50-59) are animated and are available on Foundation. The remainder are available on OpenSea.\n\nEach piece was constructed entirely by code using purpose-built algorithms configured with a combination of random inputs and human-controlled inputs. The artist personally created the algorithms and the scene renderer, and also adjusted the human-controlled inputs for each piece until a pleasing result was achieved.\n\nThis piece was inspired by the geopolitical tensions in Ukraine during early 2022.  There are reports of 100,000+ Russian troops positioned East and North of Ukraine's borders.  Invasion is a threat, but \"gray zone\" tactics are also likely.  China watches with interest.\n\nResolution: 1920x1920\nTheme: Sunrise Mimosa\nSeries: 4\nPiece: 51",
