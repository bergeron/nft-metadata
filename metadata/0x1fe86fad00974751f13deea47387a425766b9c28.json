    "description": "Everything Always, 2022 is POST WOOK's first piece of dynamic digital art. Fueled by creativity but powered by code, this piece will continue changing for as long as you'll look at it. Each layer of the piece is changing on a slightly different time interval, and will appear differently to each viewer depending on where they are on earth. Everything Always, 2022 is the first collaboration between POST WOOK and Transient Labs.",
