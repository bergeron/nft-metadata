    "description": "Too many days of my life have been spent questioning how much time I have left, when will be addiction take me. I saw my friends go, I saw families be destroyed, but still I used. The winter was always the worst for me, something about the snow just gave me an excuse to stay inside and hide from the world with my vices. This piece isn't about those days, its about finally opening my door, putting down the drugs, spending time with the people I love and losing the chains that held me down for so many years. The light blue girl working her way through the snow is a representation of me working my way to a better life and my new undying pursuit of happiness. For the first time I can look back at those nights I questioned if Id ever get to live a real life one day and say I will. ",
