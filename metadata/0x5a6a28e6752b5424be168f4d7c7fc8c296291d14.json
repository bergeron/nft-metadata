    "description": "The song is about the struggles and pressures of trying to make ends meet and keep a roof over our heads. It's a reflection on the stress and anxiety that comes with trying to provide for loved ones while juggling bills and expenses. The NFT release is a way for me to share my music and experiences with a wider audience while also providing a unique and valuable collectible for fans and collectors. It's a reminder that we're all going through similar struggles and that we're not alone in our struggles to make it through.",
