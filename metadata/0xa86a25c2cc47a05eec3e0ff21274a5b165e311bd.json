    "description": "Table lamp made of brass and black cable ties, standing on a wooden box on a wooden floor. The white, shabby wall behind the lamp is covered by the striped shadow of the lampshade. The installation plays with the dimensions of the objects - making the actual lamp seem quite small, while the shadow it casts is immense. This should remind us that it is often the small things that make big impressions.",
