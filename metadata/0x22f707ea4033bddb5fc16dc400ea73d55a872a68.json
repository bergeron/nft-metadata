    "description": "Ayahuasca vine is the first 1/1 3D plant botanical illustration of the ∆FLORA Botanical collection created by SACRΞD GARDΞN.  This piece is for MAPS charity auction and 100% of the proceeds go towards psychedelic science & research.  The winner of the auction will also receive a physical plant cutting.\n\nBanisteriopsis caapi, latin for Ayahuasca vine or b. caapi, is a giant vine with flowers that infrequently blossom in the month of January.  It is native to South America.  The vine can grow up to 100 ft in length, twining on other plants for support.  It is an entheogenic plant that makes up half of an ayahuasca brew and has been used for thousands of years as a plant teacher in the Amazon rain forest communities.\n\nSACRΞD GARDΞN is a web3 platform for plants and their people with a focus on education, conservation and cultivation of psychedelic plants.  @sacrdgardn  \nwww.sacrdgardn.com",
