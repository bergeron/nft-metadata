    "description": "Infinite Loop (2022) is a project by Silvia Weidenbach & Jon Emmony. To create a new piece of jewellery (the first ring designed in collaboration with AI), we fed historical rings, spanning over 3000 years of human creation (including pieces from the Antikensammlungen Munich, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg and The Alice and Louis Koch Collection in The Swiss National Museum, Zurich) to an Artificial Intelligence. Through a process of learning from these images, the AI began to dream new forms and jewels. The final design is shown here, with the final physical ring produced as a twin to the virtual counterpart. The physical ring has been acquired as part of The Alice and Louis Koch Collection, Zurich.\n\nThis 1/1 digital rendered NFT visualises the final outcome of the project. The sale of the NFT includes a 1/1 hologram which has been on display in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg as part of 'HANDWERK UND MEDIZIN', a permanent exhibition which features the project.",
