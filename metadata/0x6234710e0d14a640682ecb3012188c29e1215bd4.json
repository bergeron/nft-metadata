    "description": "The beauty of women and the magic of water, source of all life, are definitely two elements that I keep pursuing in my work almost obsessively. \n\nThe Liquid Dreams is almost a small series within the larger collection, a true homage to Nature, that we must stride to enjoy, protect, respect and revere.\n\nThis is one of a small group of images captured using Infrared Film, shot on the Rain Forests of Venezuela and Puerto Rico.\n\nThis is a 1/1 digital creation, currently owned by the creator. Upon purchase, the collector will be granted the right to use, distribute and display the NFT ONLY FOR NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. Since you own this unique creation, you can also re-sell the  NFT with the same non-commercial use rights to other parties in the secondary markets.",
