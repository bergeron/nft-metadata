    "description": "Illustration 01 of the W3C collection that aims to objectively explain the interconnection of Web 3 with Blockchain and NFTs.\n\nBlockchain and Web 3 are creating a new economy where people can buy and sell anything directly with each other. This economy is decentralizing possibilities so that any human being who wants to can participate.\nMaybe soon we will be able to see the most valuable works of art in the world like:\n\n1 ‚Äì Salvator Mundi. ...\n2 ‚Äì Les femmes d'Alger. ...\n3 ‚Äì Nude couch√©...\n4 ‚Äì Three Studies of Lucian Freud.\n\nBeing transformed into nfts and auctioned.\n(//A green pickup truck in the illustration is carrying these artworks - the license plate draws attention)\n\nAnyway if you appreciate art, this work contains many details for you to think about. I leave you with a beautiful landscape with the sun rising behind a beautiful mountain.\n\nW3C 01 - 16,000 X 8,000px\n1200 dpi - for printing in high-realism color, definition and sharpness. ",
