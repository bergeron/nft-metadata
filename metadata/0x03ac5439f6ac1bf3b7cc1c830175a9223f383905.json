    "description": "This is the first work in the Phantasmic series.  I created this piece during a time in my life when I committed time everyday to self reflection.  My perception of life and the way I responded to it.  In this work I confronted many shadows.  Some real, some were only a fabrication of my mind.  We could talk more about what \"real\" actually means, and if everything is actually just your mind taking in information and then creating something you can process.  Sometimes I feel like my brain is like, don't worry that was a lot, I got you.  Then it just spins something up that I can handle.  lol  \nAny way hah, let this work inspire you to confront your darker side, and eventually accept it.  We all have deep inner lives, full of desires, dreams, fantasies - we may never share these with another soul, but we can accept and honor them within ourselves.  Is life a solely mental experience?",
