    "description": "Being locked in a room during the quarantine, my guitar painted a landscape for me to escape to with every new song. The world around me was not enough, so I looked inside and created an outer world through music and art. \n\nCome for the art - stay for the music and animate the image with your imagination.\n\n'The outer world' is a one-take live guitar loop composition in what I call 'the zone' - the moment you just play, not think, yet feel everything.  \n\n\"Fleeting Thoughts' is a collection of fine art and instrumental music made up of thoughts & feelings encapsulated in moments in time through my guitar playing. The artwork is a collab with the genial touch of Erlind Selba, who, from my music, created what I call a \"sound painting.\"\n\nMy goal with my NFT music is not just to switch from being only a behind-the-scenes working musician to an artist - I aim to build the roadmap of the future musician in the web 3 world and mix both the visual and audio world into one meaningful experience.\n",
