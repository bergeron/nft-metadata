    "description": "Living in the big city sometimes can be exhausting. The city gives lots of opportunities but also can swallow you up by the range of choices you have to make. The feeling of disconnection with the roots and nature may grow. And at the end you may find yourself dissolved in the abundance of concrete.\n\nOnce in a lifetime everybody needs help. In current unstable world state this is my reproduction of that pain and calling for human intelligence and compassion.",
