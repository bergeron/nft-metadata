    "description": "Veronica\n\"The Maiden\"\nCirca 1821\n\nHer undeniable beauty and gentle aura was admired by everyone who passed her home, every morning while nurturing her garden.\nThe poultry and goats in the farm yard would dance around her feet and children will gather to greet her with glee. Suiters would bow as she gracefully passed by on the street. The maiden was loved , respected and admired by her community for her due diligence and kindness she showed to everyone and everything.\n\nThis character was inspired by my Grandmother and my mother named Veronica.\n\nMedium: Graphite and charcoal pencil on Bristol paper, with artificial flowers.\nDuration: 30 hours\nSize: 8 x 11 inches",
