    "description": "Twin Sparrow is a pointillist painting I really love because of the technique I used, the calming colors and the distant hills. \nI also love the underlying inspiration which was to show the importance of companionship in our journeys portrayed by the two birds flying side by side supporting and looking out for each other.",
