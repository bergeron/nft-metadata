    "name": "Sector Santa",
    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a magical place known as Sector Santa, a base for Santa Claus himself. It was a hidden paradise, tucked away in the depths of a majestic cave, deep in the heart of the North Pole.\n\nSanta had been living in Sector Santa for years, ever since he was a young boy, and he had made it his own personal Christmas retreat. The cave was filled with all sorts of wonderful things, from the warm and cozy Christmas decorations to the fragrant smell of freshly baked gingerbread.\n\nEvery year, Santa would leave Sector Santa to travel the world on Christmas Eve, bringing joy and happiness to children everywhere. But when he was back in the North Pole, Santa would spend his time in Sector Santa, preparing for the big night.\n\nHe would check and recheck his list of children, make sure his reindeer were well fed and groomed, and practice his sleigh-flying skills. He also made sure to take a few moments to simply relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of the cave.",
