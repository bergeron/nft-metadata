    "description": "What is the meaning of the Stones?\nuniqueness.\n\nThere is no one like you, even if there is\nbillions of people in the world, nobody, absolutely nobody\nis just like you! As with natural stones, no\nthere is in nature one stone like another.\n\nEach stone in the collection represents the uniqueness\nof the one who owns it.\n\nWhat is the meaning of Animals?\nMovement.\n\nNothing beats practice and action! The animals follow their\ninstincts and live in constant motion, their processes\nand routines are repeated day after day. those who most\nact, become leaders, authorities and most importantly,\nbecome examples!\n\nWhat is the meaning of Trees?\nEvolution.\n\nEvolution of the environment, evolution of the individual,\nevolution of knowledge and value in all of this!\n\nWhat is the meaning of Waters?\nAdaptation.\n\nEscape the patterns, learn in other ways. life doesn't\ncan be stiff and boring, it needs to be fluid and light!",
