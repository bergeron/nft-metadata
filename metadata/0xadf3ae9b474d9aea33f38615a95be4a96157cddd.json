    "description": "“Would it be alright if I kissed you?” \n Episode 11: By Way of the Sea \n\nAoife (pronounced ee-fah) is an artist, designer, creative director and founder of The Foofees. She's based in Ireland and makes work that tries to imagine what lives in the gaps of human perception. Her work can be recognised through her distinct use of colour, whimsy and her weirdly cute characters of critters and femmes. For more, visit https://thehug.xyz/artists/aoife "
