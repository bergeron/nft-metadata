    "description": "There are numerous characters on this group that can claim to making a burner graffiti. But the ‚ÄúCrackzy Villain‚Äù have a bit more of a unique history. They are a group of Writers who wanted to do burner from the outset, but failed in their goal to the point that they were eventually trusted by the power of Evil to developing a Evil Darucan to help them prevent all the bad luck around them and of course to make a burner graffiti. They believe that attaining both Love and Evil ancient power will lead to immortality and godhood. They employ robots and mercenaries to do their dirty work, since the ‚ÄúCrackzy‚Äù themselves have greatly inferior fighting skills when compared to ‚ÄúLove‚Äù Group the possibly due to their age difference.\nWhat a silly group backstory. üñ§‚ö±Ô∏è",
