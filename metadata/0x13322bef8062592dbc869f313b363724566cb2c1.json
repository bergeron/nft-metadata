    "description": "In 2013 my family and I moved to the South West of Western Australia, we'd already been visiting for over a decade, exploring each time we'd visit. After we moved to Busselton I set about exploring as much of the South West and the coast between the Capes as I could.\n\nI've photographed this particular spot quite a few times, but never had the conditions that I wanted to photograph. A few months ago I headed back to Cape Naturaliste to do some hiking and decided to take my camera with me on the off chance that sunset was worth photographing. There was no way I could have predicted how amazing the sunset would turn out.\n\nCape Naturaliste, Western Australia",
