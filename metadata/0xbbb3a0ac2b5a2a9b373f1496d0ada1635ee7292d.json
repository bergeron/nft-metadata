    "description": "introducing 'CRYPTO-923X-N1T3', a one-of-a-kind NFT artwork that will transport you to the gritty, neon-lit streets of a cyberpunk metropolis. This ATM machine is not like any you've seen before, as it has been reimagined in a style that evokes a sense of technological advancement and urban decay. The sleek lines and metallic finishes give it a futuristic feel, while the bold neon lights and graffiti elements add a touch of rebellion.\n\nBut that's not all, this artwork also comes with an original future bass soundtrack that will immerse you into the cyberpunk world. The thumping beats and atmospheric synths will enhance the overall experience of the artwork making it more interactive\n.\n2160x2640 HighResolution.mp4\nOriginalSountrack by Prams.bab\nArtwork by JZTYE",
