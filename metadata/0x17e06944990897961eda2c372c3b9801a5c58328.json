    "description": "If sunset had a soul, it would look like a timid, gentle girl with a very firm and persistent character, self-confident. Have you noticed that sunsets are always beautiful? No matter what color it is, whether there are clouds or not, we always wait for the sunset and look into the distance with a smile.\n\nI believe that each of us should learn from the sunset to be strong and confident. We are all beautiful!",
