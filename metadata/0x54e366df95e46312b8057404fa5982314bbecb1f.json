    "name": "Horizon by Zuzu Galova",
    "description": "Horizon was created by Zuzu Galova, an outstanding artist who produces bold and impactful artwork, inspired by the beauty of the female journey. Through her art, Zuzu celebrates the uniqueness and strength of women, promoting empowerment in her depictions. Her experience has allowed her to develop a unique style of illustration centred around quirky figures who live in their own super-stylised universe. Sometimes animated, her work bounces happily between funny little GIFs, minimalistic prints, and colourful murals. Zuzu has exhibited her work internationally and collaborated with numerous notable clients. \n\nZuzu is also the artist behind the unique art collection of 777 NFTs called Unimpressed Geisha. The project celebrates gaining confidence as a superpower to conquer the world, breaking down societal expectations and pressures, and embracing the uncertain twists and turns of her own journey. \n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/unimpressed-geisha",
