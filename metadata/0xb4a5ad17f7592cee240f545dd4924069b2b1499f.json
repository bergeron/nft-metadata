    "description": "We are five people working together committed to enthusiastically create and promote our work. We share a common interest in digital technology, art, comics and contemporary life. In each work, we try to convey our vision of a world where human interactions are shaped by digital technology and media. \nDyboon is the technology geek, the programmer, the most ironic person of the group. A workaholic that has his own ways to solve problems. Dyboon enjoys interfering to give advice and likes to be considered a smart Samaritan. \nMax is the consultant, the businessman, he has a competitive attitude. He sees himself as an advocate of dignity, fairness and justice, of course, in his own way. \nDeleo is a sleepy eyes writer, a bit pessimistic, but slow and steady persistent.  \nLiz is the engineer. Assertive and pragmatic, her main interest is contemporary life and the impact of digital technology in society. She also writes newspapers headlines.  \nSusan is the artist, the painter, but also the most addicted to social media. She often prefers virtual interactions to real ones.  \n(1/1, jpeg 5228 x 4034 px)",
