    "description": "The year is 2097 and Jeff Staple's Stapleverse is ushering in a new vision of community driven design and collaboration. This is the world of creative hustlers who wield the power to mould the culture in the palm of their hand.  The vessels of this newfound superpower are the SAPIENZ.\n\nThis piece features the art of RhymezLikeDimez holding the Stapleverse SV Twin Birds logo, which depicts the letters \"SV\" rotated 90 degrees revealing two birds facing one another with the guide and mentor taking the other under its wing,  In the background, the familiar Audio Galleries vista reminds us that artistic tradition and technology will merge on the horizon of the future.\n\nSV Twin Birds, Co-Create The World by Jeff Staple is the 7th Audio Galleries, Artist Edition",
