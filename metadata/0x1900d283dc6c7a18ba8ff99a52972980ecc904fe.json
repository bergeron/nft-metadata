    "description": "Poem Jakob van Hoddis \"SKY SNAKE\"\n\nSun glows and nights are silent,\nStep out of the bright windows\nThe ghosts,\nfornicating\nIn the air.\nAnd the city\nThe scent veils\ntheir booze faces.\n\n\"Let us through the great halls\nThe infatuated heavens wave;\nBecause the moon is already far away.\nThe wrath of the stars faded away.\nIs it sparkle, is it dark,\nIs it song, prayer, rumor,\nIs it palaces or junk?\nBe silent, we are in the realm of miracles.‚Äù\n \nDraw a hundred thousand armies\nThrough the cloud plane.\nHundreds of thousands of friends flee\nBefore the clouds caravan.\nOh, the thinker gets sick\nWho should consider today.\nPut him in the bucket of water.\nHe is great.\n\nMade in the Kondinsky technique\n\n",
