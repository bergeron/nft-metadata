    "description": "Maria!!! \n\nThis is a simple Ukrainian old lady that is beautiful in her simplicity. \n\nFrom an early age, she got used to working hard, not at all childish work, so that her family, which was left without a father after the war, could feed themselves. She is a child of war. She did not have a carefree childhood. From an early age, she was used to relying only on herself.\n\nHer life was not easy, but she did not lose her childish spontaneity and natural beauty. She is beautiful. She is young. And all these wrinkles on her face, these are just the lines of her life experience.\n\nDedicated to the blessed memory of my Grandmother Maria.\n\nPNG file, 4048 x 5397",
