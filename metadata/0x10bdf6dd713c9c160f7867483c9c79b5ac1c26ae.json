    "description": "This piece is about embracing the elements and going with the flow in life rather than pushing for things that aren’t meant for you. For this piece, created in the uninhabited highlands of Iceland, the weather didn’t go my way so I abandoned my original ideas and embraced the rain and wind, creating this artwork that became very special to me. \n\nSometimes being resilient and pushing through is rewarding, but sometimes it’s best to embrace life and trust that what’s meant for you will come. The last few years I’ve been pushing hard in Iceland and it’s been incredible, but I felt like I needed to breathe some different air and push pause. \n\nTaking a break from somewhere or something can feel daunting and counter-productive but it can provide perspective and fresh energy. Only you can know when it’s time for you to push and time to embrace. ",
