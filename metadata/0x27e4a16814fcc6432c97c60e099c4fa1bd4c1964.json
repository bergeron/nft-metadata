    "description": "One of my favorite things in Yellowstone National Park is using my telephoto lens on all the thermal pools. The colors and patterns are unreal and can produce something completely different each time based on the weather, steam, sky colors, clouds, etc. This is one of my favorites from last summer at Midway Geyser Basin. I am listing this as an open edition on $TURBO for 48 hours because I think this space is about experimenting and having fun. At the time of listing, it is worth about .02 eth. It will be fun to see if it goes to zero or up in value. I hope you will join me in the fun and receive a piece I truly love, from one of my favorite places on earth. \n",
