    "description": "my brother first!\nyou don't eat, because you're not hungry. you don't drink, because you're not thirsty. you don't play, because you don't want to. in fact, you are very hungry, very thirsty and want to play a lot. but you can't. being a brother means trying to be mother and father in one person if they arenâ€™t there. you try to express your love while angry at life. you're actually cheerful inside, like an amusement park, but you can't enter because you don't have anyone to take you there to play. that's why you're angry with the outside.",
