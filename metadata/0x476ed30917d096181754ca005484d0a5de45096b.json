    "description": "Every culture has a connection to flowers and stories about their beauty. Each flower has its own meaning, scent, and narrative. Weathering every storm, growing through the rain and snow. Humans, like flowers, have their own journey and stories to tell. Humans have the most valuable gift of all: the ability to grow.\nEven in the face of adversity, each soul blossoms.",
