    "description": "The human is captured in a simulation of the reptile. A terrarium. \nThe setup is a reflection of the 'between'-ness of life and the inner human nature.\n\nIt's a task of breathing with human lungs and reptile lungs at the same time.\n\nThe video work is inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's philosophical term 'becoming' (1980)\n\nVideo dimensions. 4:3\n\nThe model is the Copenhagen based bio artist Mathias Mons.",
