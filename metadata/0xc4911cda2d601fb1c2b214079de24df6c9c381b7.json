    "description": "Photographed close to my home, this is the first image in my 'RURALITY' Collection. A collection of images exploring seasonality and the interface between urban and wild. \n\nThe Welsh phrase, \"dod yn Ã´l at fy nghoed\", meaning \"to return to a balanced state of mind\" literally means \"to return to my trees\". This image is reminiscent of one of my favourite ways to spend a morning. To wander through the pathless woods, through the murk and amongst the skeletal branches. It's important to make the most of those quiet, idle hours of winter. \n\nThe collector of this image will receive a signed limited edition print and a percentage of the sale will also be donated to Trees for Life, a charity dedicated to revitalising wild forest in the Highlands of Scotland, providing space for wildlife to flourish and communities to thrive. \n\nwww.arronbeecham.com ",
