    "description": "Many beautiful things are born, destroying the integrity of surfaces and shells. The flower cuts through the bulb and pierces the soil layer. When a butterfly is born, it breaks the cocoon that has served it as a nutrient medium for a long time. This is a pattern. In order for something new to appear in life, accept that you should let the old go.\n\nDigital Art \n\n2022\n\n4000x4000",
