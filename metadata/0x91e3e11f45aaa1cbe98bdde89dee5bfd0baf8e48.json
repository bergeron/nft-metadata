    "description": "I stood still.\nFeeling nothing.\nKnowing nothing.\nWanting nothing.\n\nI forgot why I was even in the kitchen.\nIf it wasn't for the sound of dripping tap water I would have thought time stood still.\nNothing existed.\n\n..except this sweet scent of the half lemon put on the counter in front of me. It took me to a place I thought I'd never see again. I was 8 years old and dad took me to buy ice cream. I choose lemon flavor even though he suggested I try a mix of different fruits. I was stubborn and stood my ground. Later, I hated my life choice and wanted to have some of his mix fruit ice cream but my dignity stopped me. He asked me to hold his ice cream while he went inside another store. I took a taste.\n\nNow as the years passed, I realized he gave me the ice cream so I can taste it behind his back because he didn't want to hurt my ego.\nI love you dad.",
