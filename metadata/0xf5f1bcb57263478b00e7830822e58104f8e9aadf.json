    "description": "I also took a part in the shooting of this photo what caused some difficulties in its realization. I used the dividing lines of the tennis court as some support elements that allow people to get to the top. In the left corner at the bottom there's a light â€“ it's like a searchlight against unwanted guests (or violators). In the right on the top you can see the night starry sky, with the constellations of the Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, as well as Cassiopeia. The idea of this picture that no need to stop to believe in something unachievable even it's far from reality. The figures of people are showing this fight for big dreams and goals.\n",
