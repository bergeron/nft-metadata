    "description": "Sirsasana: The Yogic Headstand     \n  \nIn Sanskrit: \nDevanagari: शीर्षासन\nIAST: śīrṣāsana\n\nSirsa: Head  \nAsana: Pose  \n\nOf all the asanas, Sirsasana is the most powerfully rejuvenating and the one that most readily relieves fatigue. \n\nWhen you have learned to perform Sirsasana, you will feel like the owner of wealth. In a few minutes it will return you to joy, if you are depressed; energy, if you are exhausted; peace, if you are afflicted; confidence, which frees you from disorientation and nihilism; it will help you to stay in a good mood and serene, it will free you from phobias and emotional instabilities.\n\nThis photo was taken in Prainha Beach - which is located on the west side of the city of Rio de Janeiro and has an exuberant green nature.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I did!\n\nOm Namo Narayanaya\n\nArtist: Stela Narayana \nEdition: 1/1  \nDimensions: 3873 × 5791px\nLocation: Prainha Beach - Rio de Janeiro / Brazil \nPhoto taken Jan 2022",
