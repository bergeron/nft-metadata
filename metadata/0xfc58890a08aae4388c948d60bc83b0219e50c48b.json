    "description": "If you're like me, you love the look of hydrangeas, but you don't always love the upkeep. Here's how to make your own ornate hydrangeas that are beautiful and low-maintenance.\n\nFirst, you'll need to find a good location for your hydrangeas. They like full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Once you've found the perfect spot, it's time to get started.\n\nTo make your own ornate hydrangeas, you'll need:  \n-1 quart of hydrangea flowers  \n-1 pint of water  \n-1 tablespoon of sugar  \n-1 teaspoon of lemon juice  \n-A vase or other container\n\nStart by cutting the hydrangea blooms from the plant, making sure to leave a few inches of stem. You'll want to cut the blooms when they're just starting to open.\n\nNext, mix together the water, sugar, and lemon juice in your container. Add the hydrangea blooms and make sure they're submerged.\n\nLet the blooms soak for at least an hour, but up to 12 hours is even better. After they've had a chance to soak, remove them from the water and enjoy their beautiful blooms.\n\nYour ornate hydrangeas will last for several days, so enjoy them while you can!  \n\n\n\nMade with Disco Diffusion, description by GPT-3.",
