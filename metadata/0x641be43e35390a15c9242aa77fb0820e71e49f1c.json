    "description": "The dragon is one of the ancient and wisest creatures on the planet. \nThere is no animal or human in the world capable of resisting such a strong opponent. \n\n\"His scales are thicker than a dozen shields, his teeth are swords, his claws are spears, the blow of his tail is a thunderclap, his wings are a hurricane, and his breath spread death.\" J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nIn his paw he holds the key of the secret knowledge of this world, and the Sun is so small for him that he can easily devour it.\n\nHowever, the rare person who will be able to make friends with such a powerful being will be lucky, because in addition to a devoted friend, he will also acquire a faithful companion.",
