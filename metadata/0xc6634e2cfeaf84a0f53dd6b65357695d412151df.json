    "description": "This song was a long time in the making and I'm really glad to have some visuals to go with it. Unfortunately, Foundation hates music videos, so I had to render it at the worst quality possible to barely make it under their 50mb cutoff. Oh well, the song still rocks and you can watch the video on youtube if you really so desire. Cheers!",
