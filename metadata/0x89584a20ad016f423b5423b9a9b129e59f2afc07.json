    "description": "The Rocky Mountains of Canada, a sight to behold. From my hometown the mountains are in my backyard, always there. To me this image captures a feeling of wanting to break out of my town and head west to the Rockies. \n\nI never appreciated them growing up, but now I see just how amazing and lucky I am to be near them. If you collect this I hope you find the same desire to see them like I do.\n\nJust head west.",
