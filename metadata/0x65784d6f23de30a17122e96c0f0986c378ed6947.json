    "description": "Bored Ape Yoga Club is a 10,000-piece NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain that began as parody in the form of five memes drawn by the artist, first of BAYC #2613 and then of the Yuga Labs founders' BAYCs assuming the now infamous ape yoga position. As the images quickly spread throughout the crypto community on Twitter, demand for a complete 10k NFT collection of bored apes practicing throat yoga grew organically to a point that the artist was compelled to capture this sentiment permanently on-chain in full parity with the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs.",
