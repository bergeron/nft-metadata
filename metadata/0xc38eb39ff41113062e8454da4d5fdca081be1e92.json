    "description": "In the vast expanse of space so wide,  \nHumanity dreamed of a place to reside,  \nWhere we could learn, work and thrive,  \nAnd the Moon seemed the perfect hive.\n\nWith every step, we explored anew,  \nThe possibilities of what we could do,  \nAnd we learned to harness the Moon's might,  \nTo create a world that shone so bright.\n\nWater, the key to life's great quest,  \nWas a challenge that we did address,  \nAnd we dug to find it there,  \nA precious resource, so pure and rare.\n\nWe built great cities, tall and proud,  \nAs we stood on the lunar ground,  \nWe flourished in the lunar light,  \nWith every new discovery and insight.\n\nFor on the Moon, we found a way,  \nTo work together and to play,  \nTo create a world that we could share,  \nA place where humans mightily dare.\n\nAnd so, we learned, we worked, we grew,  \nAs we took our first steps anew,  \nOn the Moon, humanity's extended home,  \nA future that we all could call our own, \nFinally leaping out into the great unknown.",
