    "description": "The story goes back years to when I was a 5 or 6- year old kid, living in an old house in a village around Shiraz with my parents and grand mother. The village was very deprived.\nmy grand mother believed in ghosts, and some times she used to summon ghosts, but not in my presence.\none night, when I was fast asleep, suddenly, my grand mother's scream and the sound of breaking glass woke me up. The sound was from the kitchen. I noticed that the window glass was perforated in the shape of a small, very regular circle, however, nothing was thrown into the kitchen. I looked out the window, but no one was around.\nIn the place where we lived, rarely did anyone pass.\nMy grand mother turned to the window and bent down a little and looked outside and said: ''This was the revenge of devils on us. they wanted to scare us. She paused for a minute and continued:'' The war is starting''. Now that years have passed, I decided to capture that moment in the same house.\n\nSize: 5472 x 3648 px",
