    "description": "It is such a passion to feed a pigeon, that it is very difficult to, explain and understand it...\nIt's like an unrequited love, feeding pigeons...\nMaybe it's their free swing in the sky, playing games that attracts us..\nWe must not forget that we share this world withanimals.\nPigeons were effective in winning wars as homing pigeons in ancient times.  They can fly up to 1500 kilometers.\nFeeding pigeons relaxes and reduces stress.  And if you train the pigeon when it's a baby, it will come to you.\n\nArtist: Mehmet Karaca\nCamera: Canon eos 70d \nLens: Canon EF-S 10-18 MM F/4.5-5.6 IS STM\nDimensions: 3648x5472\nLocation: Kahramanmaras in TURKEY\nDate: 12.01.2019\nEdition: 1/1",
