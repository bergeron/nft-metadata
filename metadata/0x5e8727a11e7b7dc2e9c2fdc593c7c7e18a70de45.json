    "description": "This edition is from the \"Geometric Comics\" collection.  \nIn this work I show a different format where I reveal the fury of my shapes that go into a period in my inner world, where the day has come that the shapes have stopped, but the colours have begun to continue their life and they are looking for balance very much in furious mode and looking for a new breath and path, where they have been very much in shadow, but now it has come to reveal themselves and move towards perfection.  \nBefore that was the introduction of \"Geometric Comics\". \nAnd now the first chapter begins",
