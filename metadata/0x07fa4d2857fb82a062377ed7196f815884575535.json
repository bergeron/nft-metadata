    "description": "While scrolling around the streets of Kulasai, I found numerous people dressed up as Kali and carrying fire pots. Some of them were in trance and dancing as the procession closed to the temple.I stumbled upon a devotee who was playing with fire, and found it intriguing. He suddenly threw the fire pot , caught in another hand and he was in trance for a while.  Documenting such a moment was a wild experience in my life.",
