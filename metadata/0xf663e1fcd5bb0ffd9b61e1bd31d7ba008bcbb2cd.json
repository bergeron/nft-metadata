    "about": "A.L. Grime is a Venezuelan-American multimedia artist living in Denver, CO. She explores the rise of the technological era through the lens of the human experience by juxtaposing abstract portraiture with patterns that simulate both data systems and organic processes. She seeks to depict the feminine spirit emerging through the concrete grid, in essence fighting to bridge the gap between technology and spirituality through an aggressive return to emotion. She seeks to innovate how we experience art, continuously seeking the latest tech such as AR, NFTs, and the Metaverse. She believes art and technology will bring humans closer in the world, and she aims to share a message of empathy and unity through her creativity.",
