    "description": "OneDayBTC is an art project that for the first time tokenized every day of Bitcoin from 2010 to 2021. 12 years translated into 4178 NFT days. These days include data on the time, price, and appearance of the daily candle in 3D format. They also contain rare events in 6 categories: year, volatility, events, tweets, countries, social phenomena. For convenience, each NFT indicates the place of its year on the 12-year chart. We can say that the OneDayBTC art project has wrapped bitcoin in NFT! The project implemented the theoretical model Pasters of Mr. Ross. This is a holistic theory about access to the values of the past by means of blockchain and NFT. The collection will be constantly supplemented with new NFT day candles in various designs as long as Bitcoin exists. Read our fascinating roadmap!",
