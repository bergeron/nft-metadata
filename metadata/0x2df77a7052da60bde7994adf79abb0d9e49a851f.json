    "description": "What does \"Stunningly Sensual Woman\" mean?\nIt is a gift, a prize, a happiness for the man who is lucky enough to meet her.  She is very emotional and lives with an open heart and soul. When a sensual woman is happy, her soul rejoices in ecstasy. When she is unhappy her soul sings.\nExcerpt from the song \"Stop\" by singer Sam Brown.",
