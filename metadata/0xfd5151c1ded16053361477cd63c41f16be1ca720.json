    "description": "'high tonight' is my ode to los angeles, and more specifically, my hometown: inglewood, ca. this is hands down one of my favorite tracks of all time. if you've ever been to any of my shows, you already know how much the crowd and i rock out to this jam!\n\none person in particular who loves this song is Faith Love, who I'm gearing up to release collab merch with soon! winner of this golden egg will receive a piece of merch from this line. [:\n\n'high tonight' was featured on snoop dogg's first mix on sound. it was also featured in tyler perry's show \"sista's\" on BET recently! a lot of good history on this one, so i had to bring it to the blockchain. hope y'all love it as much as me.\n\nlove,\niman <3",
