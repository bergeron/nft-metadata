    "description": "Collection of the Ukrainian sky. Peaceful sky. In Russian language, the word Â«worldÂ» (Â«Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€Â») in which we live and the word Â«peaceÂ» (Â«Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€Â») that was taken away from Ukraine are one word (world = peace). It is this word that we think of first when we look at the sky. The sky is the Â«worldÂ». The world we live in and the world we need. Heaven is peace in its own word. The sky can only be peaceful. Even in the language of those who destroyed this world.\n\nSupport my initiative ðŸ’›ðŸ’™. Part of the sale will be donated to UAnimals, the official Ukrainian animal rights organization that helps animals during the war in Ukraine.",
