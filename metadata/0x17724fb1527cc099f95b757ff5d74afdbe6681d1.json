    "description": "This is the first nft in the collection of Magical Fauna, consisting of 2 paintings, which was created as a single unique 1/1 nft work . \n\nPhoto: 4641 x 7000 px\n\nThe painting was not painted from a blank canvas, it was preceded by its own history of creation and its own images, which then turned into a Lion.\n\nThe magical image of the Tiger, a representative of the fauna. \n\nThe wandering tiger. It is wandering because first a landscape was painted. Then the landscape with the lake turned into a street somewhere in Morocco. I was looking for the image of that very tiger, and it came to me in December 2021. And finally the tiger appeared on the canvas in accent spots. It symbolizes the journey of searching for that very, intimate and personal thing that eventually comes and is fulfilled in our lives!\n",
