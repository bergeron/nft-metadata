    "description": "Prestige at the Peak of Protection ! \n\n\"Backing the temple was a majestic curtain of falling water, its misty spray painting rainbows in the air behind the grounds. We called it Dragonfall.\n\nThe largest of these falls provided the Temple’s seven-color-hued aura. Traveling from the point of impact, the water moved to surround the temple, forming a stream that ran 12 feet across. The sunlight which reflected off its surface always made it look as if the temple wore a choker studded with diamonds.\n\nThe water then continued its journey through a submerged passage, and flew out of the mountain face through the jaws of a gigantic dragon’s head, carved directly into the mountain’s stone. It’s where I was currently standing.\"\n\nMy submission for Juuni's lore art contest. ",
