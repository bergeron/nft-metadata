    "description": "I woke up in a library\n\nBut this isn’t just a normal library I used to know, a three-headed librarian looks straight at me. One on the right, growling angrily, and one on the left, weeping sadly. Her middle head smiled at me and kindly asked me to return what I have borrowed but I’m not the type of person who forgets to return something, I always return them on time. She asked again, the book in her hands started to flip. Page by page, I felt like the growling and weeping were louder and louder and her smile became weirder and weirder.\n\nBefore I could see anything more, the book slammed shut and the library collapsed\n",
