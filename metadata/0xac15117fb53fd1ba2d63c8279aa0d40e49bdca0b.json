    "description": "Keep Pushing is a song that was birthed in 2016 as a motivational mantra to myself and the struggles I’ve faced throughout my almost 6.5 years as a professional music producer, and my over 20 year pursuit of music.\n\n I’ve faced homelessness at multiple times in my life, my album art is a picture I took of myself producing music in a homeless shelter and the minimal equipment I could bring at the time, but made the most amazing music at this time.\n\nThis song has been through multiple changes , but I enlisted the help of Grammy Award winning Jamaican producer, SOS Dynamikz for this song, and together we created a musical soundscape behind the deep lyrics of this song.\n\nIn addition to golden eggs, collectors will receive access to exclusive content such as demos of the song, photos from the time at the shelter and more.\n\nThis song is a testament to both SOS' and I perseverance and determination, and we are proud to bring this song to Sound.",
