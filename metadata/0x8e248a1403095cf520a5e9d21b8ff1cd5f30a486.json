    "description": "Musings of a heart clinging to dying strength.\nHow strong would I be if my breath has been infiltrated with fears?\nFears of my rights to dream.\nWill my existence make a mark of sacrifice if ever am to be reborn?\nOr will I be in the shackles of pain and limitations cos that's the level I was told I can only dare aspire for.\n I wish I received the support for breaking same record, \n obu aru nam bu nwanyi?\nAll I wanted was for my voice to be heard.\nHeard for the respect I deserve.\nHeard not for the mounds on my chest.",
