    "description": "I've been wanting to do a shoot at this well-known abandoned house that sits on the Canadian boarder for years now, but for some reason never got around to it. I think I had felt in my heart that I didn't really have the right ideas to do this location justice, and since this is such a highly photographed location, I didn't want to take the same photo as everyone else has been taking for 30+ years. \n\nI saw recent photos of it and decided that I'd better do something fast, for it is quite evident that this structure may not survive another winter of heavy snow, and perhaps even a windy summer storm could collapse it. This location is three and a half hours from my house, so one morning I packed up my car, everything I made, my gear, and my partner and we left the house at 2am to catch the sun coming up. The drive was incredible and I found a lot of locations to use for future shoots. When we arrived, there was a moose across the street- truly an incredible place. It seemed like we had the world to ourselves.\n\nThis is the second photo of the series The Merchants Of Planet Odyssey.",
