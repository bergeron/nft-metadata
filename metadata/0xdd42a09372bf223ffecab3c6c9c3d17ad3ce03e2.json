    "name": "The Time Keeper",
    "description": "The rich proverbial saying from the men of my tribe (Yoruba) goes that: before the discovery of maize, the fowl has been feeding on something. So also, before the discovery of clock, something have been telling the time to humans. \"The time keeper\" seek to explore the amazing ability of this animate character (cock) to efficiently communicate time to the African man and the world at large, especially in the night. Just like the rest of the world, time is of the essence for the African man, and the means through which they tell time is through cockcrow. this amazing animal character subtly remind them of how much the day/night is far spent at intervals, and in the final part of the day/night, it gives the final crow to signal humans to round up for the day or rise up and get ready for the days work.",
