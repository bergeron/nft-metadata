    "description": "Liquified Souls is an artwork that explores the impact of modern technology on human connection and communication. Inspired by the way people increasingly interact through digital channels rather than in-person, the piece depicts a couple whose bodies have been transformed into avatars, symbolising the fluidity and intangibility of digital relationships. The artwork challenges viewers to reflect on the potential loss of human connection in an increasingly virtual world, and the ways in which technology can both facilitate and hinder our ability to truly connect with one another.",
