    "description": "✦ it is not a sexual problem but a human problem. the self finds itself in a strange body casing and cannot understand [dualism]. aghast at the arbitrary nature of genitality, the accidentality of a sexual emergence[...] the self cannot accept the impermanence of the body casing or its incompleteness— now male, now female. the body makes no sense to us in its physical thingness, which ties us to a particular kind of fate, a one/sided sexual role. the hermaphroditic image represents a striving for wholeness, a striving that is not sexual but ontological. ✦ \nThe Denial of Death ✦ Ernest Becker \n\nPerformative self-portrait from a short film series INCARNATIONS ☥ by Solomon Aphroditus \n2021 ",
