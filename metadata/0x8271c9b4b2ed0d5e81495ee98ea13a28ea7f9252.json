    "description": "Since the day my spaceship crashed here on Planet Earth, I have fallen in love with the vibrant colors of this planet. The landscapes and sunsets of Earth are some the best in the galaxy. I also love how you humans use colors in your fashion styles and with your vehicle choices. \n\nMuch of what I know about humans I learned from watching television, and I have watched a lot of music videos.\n\nIn this video for \"BeatBoy Taught Me\" we set out to make a classic rap video the way that you humans do it. In order to achieve this vision, we needed the following three ingredients:\n\n1. Hot Girls\n2. Expensive Cars\n3. Attitude\n\nWith the right ingredients in place, we then went all out with the color scheme. We had two beautiful Lamborghini Urus SUVâ€™s & we customized our outfits to match the colors of the vehicles. We went with a sporty look for the Alien girls this time and a crazy yellow and black sweatsuit for Jack.\n\nShout out to our friends that pulled up for the shoot! Shout out to my homie BeatBoy for the beat!  Shout out to Henry's Original for being our official cannabis sponsor for the day, shout out to JHydeTheShooter for the amazing videography!  Shout out to Glass, the web3 community, and all of the Aliens! And shout out to you for collecting this Music Video NFT!",
