Artwork, development, and social channels all created by one guy. Majority of the Attributes are thoughtfully crafted to represent various aspects of the Blue Collar, Working Class Lifestyle. Gruntz Union aims to be the first project dedicated to establishing a community of those who share these values giving them a platform to connect. Ownership of a Grunt provides access to special Community of Creators, Builders, Crypto Junkies, Gearheads and Rowdy, Beer Buzzin Degenerates. The Official Half Assed roadmap is broken down into three phases: Establishment/Connection, Rewards, and Heavy Utility.
