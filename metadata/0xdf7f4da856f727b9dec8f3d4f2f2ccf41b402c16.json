    "description": "I felt so much pity for the people who were close to me, I never found my place, I felt bitter...my life is upside down...I don't understand what life is, I would like to see it as a wrong place of my soul, but after all...what do I know about it? I don't even know who I am, but on the other hand, who would I be if I didn't know who I am? I always felt away from the people I had close to me. And when it didn't happen... the planets lined up.",
