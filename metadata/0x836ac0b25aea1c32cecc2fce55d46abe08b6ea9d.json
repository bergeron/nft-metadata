    "description": "We are an enchanted group. The spell of loneliness\nPeople who all have some sort of confusion that has affected their entire lives. We are all alike in a way.\nA similarity that has caused a kind of worry and anxiety, loneliness and futility, terror and darkness in all faces.\nA similarity that is very, very difficult to get rid of.\nBut we give meaning to our existence in this spiritual path with the light of the Angel of Hope and we will find the path of life.\n",
