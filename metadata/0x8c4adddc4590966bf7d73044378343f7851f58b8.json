    "description": "The empty aisles whispered in my ear: What are you doing here? I'm empty, you shouldn't be here. No one misses me and I miss no one, and nothing but loneliness. The milks stared, forgetting such fast-moving moments. Time froze, the lights never went out, ominously scattering their photons onto the silent slabs of the marble floor, the net of frozen air, and the facade of my reality. We have visited these aisles many times, but have we ever stopped to soak up the atmosphere of this transience? Every day, the footsteps of hundreds of people wear the cold floors of supermarkets. Have we met yet? There is some disturbing calmness in the silence that dominates the pre-closing supermarkets: that there is life after man. We created the liminality.",
