    "description": "     My first NFT on Foundation! This painting was made on a 36x48 canvas, with oils. \n     I have always been fascinated by the word Victory. I feel like every time I work, I am competing with myself. I may either fail and be defeated, or I will feel victorious for a moment until I move on to the next image. I love this aspect of making art. I love the potency of defeat. I love the chance. \n     I am always returning to Francesco de Goya. For this painting, I referenced Witches' Flight. When I saw that painting for the first time, it felt as if I was walking in on a ritual that I shouldn't be seeing. I think often about the ways in which his work symbolizes the tragic vices of the human experience. I tried to reinterpret some of those vices within my own work.  \n     I think this painting taught me how to see space and perspective in a clearer way. Although I was painting something tragic, I had a helluva good time with it. \n",
