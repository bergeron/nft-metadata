    "name": "A 610-word speech by an ordinary teaspoon",
    "description": "One morning, I felt the teaspoon I was holding was trying to say something. By that evening, I knew what it wanted to say.\n\nThe fact of the matter is: All inanimate objects can speak if given a voice and a little extra time.\n\nThe voice I gave my teaspoon was a stream of leptons. To give it the extra time it needed to express itself, I dilated time by accelerating those leptons to 21 percent of the speed of light.\n\nThe teaspoon received the shapeless lepton stream and molded it into its own words. Its words were in leptons, so I used an interpreter to render them into a language intelligible to humans --- to visible light.\n\nNo artificial intelligence has been involved in this work; and no post-processing has been done. \n\nHere I present to you: 610 unique words, articulated by a teaspoon.\n\nA message to the next owner of this piece:â€¨ \nAfter this piece becomes yours, I may release speeches by other inanimate objects. But none will have more than 89 words.",
