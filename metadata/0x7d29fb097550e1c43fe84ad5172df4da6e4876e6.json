    "description": "Deth Medals are a new type of badge that have been enhanced with magic. These badges are said to have originated from the darkest depths of the internet, where they were first used by anonymous internet users to spread negativity and death. However, over time, these medals have been taken up by positive people and organisations as a way to spread positivity and good vibes. Now, they are used by people all over the world as a way to connect with others and make the world a better place.",
