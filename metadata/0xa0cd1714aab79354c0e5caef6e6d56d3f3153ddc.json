    "description": "Shooting in Chinatown, ( Los Angeles) can be a drag. It’s either dead and nothing to shoot or there’s a lot going on. On this day it was dragging until a white truck stop in front of this shop. Once they open the door I saw a pile of dead pigs inside which I knew I had to take a picture of. Once I looked back at this photo I had to reflect on his face gesture. We all have our own opinion on this topic, and I feel like this photo will bring that emotion out of the viewer. ",
