    "description": "Is the universe mirrored inside the human form?  \nBlurred and pixelated, created in the darkness, we float.  \nWe walk from infinity to thought, unknown to known, space to Earth.\n\nPoem by Lydia smith \n\n\nA Sketch of the digital sculpture \"Infinity & Beyond' created by Smith in collaboration with painter Evie Mae Jacobs. \n\nWhen Smith used her unique scanning technique to translate her sculpture 'Internal Universe' into the digital realm, the distortions resembled elements alluding to organs. \n\nJacobs' womb-like piece ‘Mother Cocoon’, and Smith's sculpture 'Internal Universe' serendipitously merge the themes of new beginnings and the unknown. \n\n‘Mother Cocoon’ focuses on the connection between mother and child, and  'Internal Universe'  explores the creation of energy. \n\nThese works blend together with ease, to generate a digital artwork that references the creation of life itself. \n\nInfinity & Beyond (Moving Sketch) by Lydia Smith is the 5th Audio Galleries, Artist Edition.",
