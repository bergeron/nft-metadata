    "description": "Image generated using AI.\n\nDedicated to the ones who filled my 2022 with light and grace.\n\nInspired by these amazing words* from If You Were Light by @baekgahee:\n\nYou were like a cigarette that I couldn't finish smoking, you were hands I couldn't slap away, you were the moonlight that chased me, the sunlight I couldn't turn away from. You were all of my luck, and my greatest unhappiness was your absence. I love you. Today is the last time I will say it.\n\nI was before you the purest, often burning, too excited, and greatly demolished. You were a flower in the desert that I wished to make bloom even if I had to pour everything into you, and it was nothing at all to stop breathing lest you fly away.\n\n..  \n..  \n*This was hastily translated into English from the original Korean without permission. The original Korean words do not belong to me. They belong to @baekgahee or @1riot_of_emotion on Instagram. Love her work. Please don't sue me!  \n​",
