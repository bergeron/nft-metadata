    "description": "Single exposure self-portrait. I was out in the West Desert of Utah trying to capture reflections of the Milky Way after a summer storm. I had set up my camera at a previous location when there was a big crash on the freeway near by. That resulted in a helicopter landing on the freeway and a big traffic jam on the route back to my home. There was a helicopter with floodlights hovering above as well. Rather than packing up for the night, I decided to drive another 40 mins west and got to this location. It took me multiple attempts to make this photograph. I would walk to a specific spot, wait till the water was calm again and then trigger my camera. I repeated this many times till I got my placement in the scene right.",
