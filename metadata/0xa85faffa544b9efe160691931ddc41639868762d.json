    "description": "“How can I be substantial if I do not cast a shadow? I must have a dark side also if I am to be whole.” \n-Carl Jung\n\nOnce we allow ourselves to recognize and accept the darkness that exists within us, we are able to see ourselves more clearly. We can become more grounded, whole, and capable of honest and real connection. Our relationship with ourselves and others improve, and our minds and hearts are open to greater compassion and understanding. \n\nThis 1/1 piece was generated using Stable Diffusion AI, upscaled and enhanced and hand-painted in Photoshop.
