    "description": "**Artwork by:** Jakeob 'Spud' Watson | *Series:* Kanga Walla Fox\n\n**Collection total:** 2222 | **Series total:** 368\n\nIs a fusion of the 2 worlds I live in - my culture and the culture of hip hop and graffiti.\n\nKanga Walla Fox referring to a joke my father would say growing up and something that I say now to my children, when pointing out kangaroos and when trying to explain their totem-animal, the red footed paddy melon.\n\nKWF features some unique special rarity features that pay respect to culture, community and family and things that I hold very close to my heart.\n\nWithin the background is my graffiti letters SPUD in a flowing style. This is to pay respects to the flowing waters of the hunter river where I grew up - a place I love to still visit today, to clear my head and re connect to Mother Earth.",
