    "name": "A Fall From Grace ",
    "description": "The Grace building fascinated me for years long before my visit to New York. Designed by Gordon Bunshaft, the unique architecture of bright travertine, contrasted with large dark windows, clinically sharp edges and simple flamboyant curves mesmerised me from first sight in 2018. Reaching the roof, we were surrounded by rainclouds and huddled together under a water unit to shelter from the torrential downpour as we assessed the situation. Fog clouded much of the view but my fascination for the building flourished. It was dreamlike wandering round the architecture I had studied for so many years. This frame was the last I took before water damage cut our visit short, leaving the building soaked through nothing else mattered, a dream had come true.",
