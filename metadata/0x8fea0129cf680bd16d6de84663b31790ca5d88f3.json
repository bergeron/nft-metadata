    "description": "Natural History Museum, London.\n\nThis image was shot during a trip to London with my partner in July 2019, one of the place we have visited was Natural History Museum. We arrived at the museum quite late, so we only managed to see some parts of the museum. The museum is often busy and full of tourists, so it's quite difficult to get a photo of the place without anyone around. However, my partner and I stayed back until the last minute before the museum closes, that allowed me to capture a photo with no distractions around. Thankfully, the security that asked us to leave gave us extra few minutes to capture the shot before we leave.\n\nDimensions: 5156px x 7951px | 300dpi | 11.3MB",
