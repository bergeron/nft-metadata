    "description": "Mongolian and Tibetan legends say that in ancient times, from a distant star, a wonderful Stone – Chintamani in the east, Holy Grail in the west – sent to help people, fell to the ground. Everywhere where the Stone appeared, happiness came. In Buddhism, the Chintamani Stone is held by the Bodhisattvas (divine beings with great compassion, wisdom, and power).  In the west, the Chintamani stone is known as the Holy Grail, Different traditions describe it as a cup, dish, or stone with miraculous powers that provide happiness, eternal youth, or sustenance in infinite abundance. In Parzival novel, Wolfram von Eschenbach, citing the authority of a certain Kyot the Provençal, claimed the Grail was a Stone, the sanctuary of the neutral angels who took neither side during Lucifer's rebellion. It is called Lapis exillis, which in alchemy is the name of the Philosopher's stone.",
