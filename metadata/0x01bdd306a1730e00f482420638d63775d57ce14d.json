    "description": "Play as TurboToad and collect coins from Mom's basement, the burger joint and finally the spaceport. Face the boss frog, then take the rocket ship to the moon!\n\nStarting from scratch, no templates, no ready-made game frameworks, no off-the-shelf assets. \n\nOne of the world's first arcade-style games created entirely with AI tools. Code developed by chatGPT4, graphics by Midjourney, music by Soundraw.io.\n\nCreated May 2023.\n\nFunds raised will go towards further development of the game engine (with chatGPT helping out), including high scores, extra levels, choice of difficulties, new characters and more.\n\n[View full screen](https://5xx67nn6xeelglaxhglkynk6g5j4qlrvnxilpmtjwtjp374mb42q.arweave.net/7e_vtb65CLMsFzmWrDVeN1PILjVt0LeyabTS_f-MDzU/)",
