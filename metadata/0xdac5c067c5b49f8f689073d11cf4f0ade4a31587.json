    "description": "One of my favorite buildings in the city, monumental Central Railway station, dating back to 1931, is the largest railway station in Europe by volume and is a unique blend of many different styles, especially [Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau) and [Art Deco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco). From the air the view at dawn is especially enriched by the train tracks lights fading gently towards North.",
