    "name": "NGC 6726 - The Bass Nebula",
    "description": "Cosmic dust clouds and young, energetic stars inhabit this telescopic vista, less than 500 light-years away toward the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. The dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way. But the striking complex of reflection nebulae produce a characteristic blue color as light from the region's young hot stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The dust also obscures from view stars still in the process of formation. The smaller yellowish nebula NGC 6729 bends around young variable star R Coronae Australis. Just below it, glowing arcs and loops shocked by outflows from embedded newborn stars are identified as Herbig-Haro objects. \n\nOn this framing, to my eye I see a large mouth bass emerging from the depths, and have therefore dubbed it the Bass Nebula!\n\nImaging System – Planewave CDK17, FLI ML16803, 10 Micron GM3000 \nExposure – LRGB, 17 hours\nLocation/Date – El Sauce, Chile/2021",
