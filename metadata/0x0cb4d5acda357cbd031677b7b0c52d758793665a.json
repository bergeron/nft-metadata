    "name": "Alec Soth - Sonya and Dombrovsky. Odessa.",
    "description": "In 2018 I photographed portraits in Odessa as part of my project, \"I Know How Furiously Your Heart is Beating.\" In advance of my visit, I learned about Stas Dombrovsky. Along with being an actor and poet, he's a former prisoner and recovered drug addict who is active in the fight against AIDS. On Facebook I saw pictures of him with his girlfriend Sonya and asked if she could be a part of the shoot. Usually I prefer solitary portraits, but the picture of them together was magic.",
