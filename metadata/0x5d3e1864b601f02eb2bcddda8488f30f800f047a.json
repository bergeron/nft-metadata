    "description": "Born in the 1970s in Germany, I developed a passion for photography early on. These are mainly landscapes and special things that should take the viewer on a multifaceted journey. The focus is on the beauty of the moment, which always inspires my international collectors as well as myself.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nÂ© m8h8w - 2022 All Rights Reserved\n",
