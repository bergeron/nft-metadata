    "description": "Gone to Therapy, Be Back in a Lifetime\n\nWhile polaroids have been around since 1937, their nature mirrors the instant gratification our society craves today. Despite polaroids being \"instant\", even after the image is captured we must wait, patiently, with anticipation to see what beauty will be revealed from nothing. The image once developed can never be replicated, filtered, or photoshopped unlike today's digitized photos. What comes out of the camera is raw, tangible beauty that allows us to hold a fleeting moment in our own two hands. But these physical images will deteriorate just as we all will. My inspiration for this collection is to digitally immortalize the development process of each photo revealing itself to the world for the first time.\n\n1/1\nMedium: Fujifilm Instax Wide 300\nWhere: Sterling, Nebraska USA, May 2015\n\nFirst buyer will receive original image mailed to them upon purchase",
