    "description": "Each photograph in the series is a composite of hundreds of exposures that I take of myself over a short period. I recopose my face into a single new likeness that is somehow wrong, since I combine contradictory and incompatible expressions. \n\nIn fact, these are not really self portraits, since they don’t really resemble me. Instead, they are portraits of mistakes. Done during the pandemic lockdown and the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, these photographs are “mis-taken,” so to speak: poor renderings of my physiognomy. In a sense, these “self portraits” record the mistakes I made in their making, but they also speak, somehow, of mistakes made in my life, my country, and the world at large.\n\nEdition: 1 of 1",
