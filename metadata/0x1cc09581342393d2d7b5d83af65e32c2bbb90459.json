    "description": "Your favorite NFTs hand drawn with a realistic felt style and texture by Nick Marbles. This collection was bridged from the original Felt Fellas collection which was launched on the polygon blockchain in the summer of 2021. The original Felt Fellas are now on their own ethereum smart contract where they can be free to be themselves! This collection is made up entriely of hand drawn 1/1 originals, commissions, and derivative NFTs. 50% of all primary sales in this collection go directly to the Felt Fella's buyback - a monthly drawing for holders of an NFT from The Felt Fellas, a collection of 2500 generative NFTs on the ethereum blockchain. For more information on both the OG Fellas and The Felt Fellas collections as well as information about any other happenings in the world of Felt Fellas visit feltfellas.com :)",
