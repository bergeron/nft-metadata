    "description": "A lot of us associate our fate with a certain number. Take for example a character in Jeorge Amado’s novel “Donna Flor and Her Two Husbands.” He was certain that 17 was his number. I used to play basketball and volleyball when I was a kid. I wore number 8 but I do not think that 8 is my number. Sometimes people revere numbers a great deal but sometimes they are ambivalent to them. What impacts our mind? How great is this influence? Is it mere superstition or is there something more to it?\n\nEvery year on my birthday I give myself a gift - I paint a painting with the number 27. But is it my number? What about you? What is your lucky number?",
