    "description": "I was recently scammed by cyber scammers. I was very upset and felt very helpless. And even thought to give up their artistic hobbies.\n\nHowever, I decided not to give up and use my talents to get my money back. I started working on a picture that is dedicated to my situation and people who also became victims of scammers.\n\nI created a painting and its value is equal to the amount that was stolen from me. I hope that my painting will become a symbol of the fight against cybercrime and will help other artists to avoid becoming victims of scammers.",
