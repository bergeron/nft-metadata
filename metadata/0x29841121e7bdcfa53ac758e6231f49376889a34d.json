    "description": "Designing an interior space is a complex and multifaceted task that requires a range of skills, including creativity, spatial reasoning, and an understanding of human needs and behavior. While AI can play a role in some aspects of interior design, it is not yet capable of fully replacing human designers. However, AI can analyze images and suggest color schemes and materials based on the user's preferences and the style of the space.",
