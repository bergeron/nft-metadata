    "description": "10,000 Multiverse traveling Monkeys.  These 10,000 unique NFT'S were programmatically generated using a ground breaking new technique developed by world-renowned artist Andrew Harr.  By using a new process invented by the artist called 'Precision Mapping' each unique trait was handpainted with a palette knife IRL and photographed digitally.  The paintings were then promptly destroyed.  Completely decentralized and made Web3 compatible these first experimental NFT's represent a new symbiotic relationship with the physical and the digital.  In fact, they had never existed until they were Algerithmically generated, which makes them both a physical and digital creation. Early pioneers of this community will be awarded a free Minting for the next series as well as all holders being granted access to first dibs at floor price for the next series which is currently already in progress.  Will they evolve?  Will they mutate?  Will another animal break through the multiverse?",
