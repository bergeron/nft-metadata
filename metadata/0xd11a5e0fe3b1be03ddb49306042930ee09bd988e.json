    "description": "This past year has been a really dark time. I have been sick and bedridden at one point. During that time and still now, I miss being outside with nature and singing with the wind. As months went by, I felt I needed to pour out my thoughts and feelings on the meaning of existence to me in this collection. This piece represents how I feel when I am under the suns warmth. How vibrant a star shines for this world and for myself. I see it as not all hope is lost. My character Sunni is hope, joy, and how amazing it is to be alive. My illness will not be forever and I will be able to have my life back one day.",
