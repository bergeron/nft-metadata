    "description": "While iving in Colombia I got amazed by the diversity of flora and fauna. Another thing amaised me that white-skinned people are shown on television, but the entire population has dark skin.\nOn this picture, on the one hand, I expressed my admiration for the nature of this country, on the other hand, I want to show that the skin color / habits / lifestyle are different for everyone and it is foolish to say that someone is right, that he is doing the right thing, and someone no.\nIn nature, all niches are occupied, earth, air, water. \nLiving organisms differ in sound, color, smell, light etc. \nNature is very diverse and unique. Harmoniously and infinitely wise. \nAnd thanks to this, everything exists and on this picture I'm expressing the idea that our differences are beautiful, amazing and wonderful. \nAnd we need to appretiate that every person can do something different. \nWell, the beetles are just very beautiful. \nAnd I like green color- the color of life.
