    "description": "Cú Chulainn (The Hound of Chulainn) is the most famous hero from Irish mythology, the demi-god protagonist of our ancient epic The Táin. \n\nI have always loved our mythological stories, especially his. Most myths tend to be crazy, but the story of the boy Setanta, who becomes the fearsome Cú Chulainn after killing a giant guard dog with a 'sliotar' (the ball from our Irish sport of Hurling) and his epically batsh*t rages known as 'Warp-spasms', was my favourite. \n\nThis is my version. I wanted to depict him in a new way - rangy and fierce and dangerous. And not entirely in control of his more violent impulses... He's not a villain, he's just slightly deranged.\n\nHis weapon is a 'Hurl' (the stick used in Hurling) but he is decked out with sockets and wires, placing him in my wider story universe. \n\nThis is the first image I made of him. The first in a series. \n\nMinted on St Patricks Day, 2023.",
