    "description": "Blend of cope +‎ opium. First cited usage points back to the album entitled Copium released by American rapper Keak da Sneak in 2003. Surface analysis also yields a connotation of cope +‎ -ium, where -ium is an ending typical of names for atomic elements. The construction is similar to that of unobtainium, a fictional substance that is extremely hard to get.\n\n(Internet slang, neologism, derogatory, humorous) A fictional or metaphorical opiate taken in order to cope when one is faced with loss.",
