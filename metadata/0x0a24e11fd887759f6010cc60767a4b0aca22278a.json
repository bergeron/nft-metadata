    "description": "Arcadia is a real and or imagined place of peace and magic renowned as an escape to a world of simple pleasure.\n\nTHE UNVEILED is an interpretation of that multidimensional love feeling from the human-animal bond and the release of the 'love hormone' oxytocin ~ as seen though my rose tinted, curious & slightly psychedelic lens. Chemistry between People & Animals is real (Itâ€™s Science). Oscillating between physical & digital mediums this artwork incorporates collage, drawing, painting & digital design.",
