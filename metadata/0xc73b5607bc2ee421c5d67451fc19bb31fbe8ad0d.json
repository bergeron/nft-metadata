    "description": "Bigger Problems is an art photography project that seeks to bring awareness about an illness caused by breast implants not validated by the medical community. This condition attacks the body systemically. It talks about wounds sustained by a wounded system. The invisibility of the illness is just a manifestation of a truth that does not want to be seen.\n\nThe project currently consists of two chapters: the first is a personal visual journey using the concept of illness as a healing power. The second chapter, in progress, is the collection of visual and written stories from people in the online community who wish to share their experience with beauty adjustments to reflect on our culture and the the iatrogenic wounds of the medical industry. \nMade on 35mm disposable camera.",
