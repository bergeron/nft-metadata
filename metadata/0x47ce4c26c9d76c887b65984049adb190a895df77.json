    "description": "I've had a nasty inner monologue since I was 15. I've had a difficult relationship with my body ever since. I hated it. As a consequence, I lost touch with my sensuality and became numb and detached.\n\nI started hating my body gradually - through painful interactions with random people in my teen years. Through nicknames family members had for me. Because guys didn't find me attractive and just weren't interested in me. \n\nI spent my 20s in deep insecurity and self-abuse - through draconian diets, brutal limitations, and extremely high standards for how I look. \n\nIn the first half of 2022 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2 and my boyfriend of 9 years broke up with me. I decided that it's time to heal my relationship with my body and reclaim my sensuality. \n\nThis collection is a collaboration with the amazing Stefan Vasilev from definedecadent.com, who captured the process of me becoming my own canvas and taking back control over my femininity.",
