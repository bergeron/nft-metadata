    "description": "The first and perhaps one of the most famous climbs of the #ontheroofs team. \n\nThe Pyramid of Cheops in Cairo. During the Arab Spring in Egypt, we came to the country, hid in the tombs, and illegally climbed up one of the oldest structures in the world. After this climb, we were put on a wanted list by the Egyptian authorities and were promised a 3-year jail term. ",
