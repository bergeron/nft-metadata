    "description": "'The Tropicalia Road' is a photo collage experiment created using AI (The Midjourney V5), historical research and photo editing. The idea was inspired by the Beatles Abbey Road cover adapted to reflect the spirit of the Brazilian Tropicália movement of the 1970s. The group of Brazilian musicians that includes Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethânia and Caetano Veloso are crossing the \"classic crosswalk\" in a vibrant street inspired by Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe Tropicália movement was a cultural and artistic movement that emerged in Brazil in the late 1960s and early 1970s and had a profound impact on Brazilian culture and music. His legacy can still be seen today in the work of many contemporary Brazilian musicians and artists. It was a response to the social and political changes taking place in Brazil at the time.",
