    "description": "When you look up at the night sky, what do you see? \nPerhaps a few clouds, the stars, and the moon? I will tell you about things that you cannot see. About those who live above the clouds. About a juggling moon and about a magic carnival.\n\nThe air is filled with scents of buttery popcorn and burned caramel, when an entire circus appears in the sky, carried by fluffy big clouds. A juggling Moon has captivated the crowd with spellbinding storytelling. There is a colossal Ferris wheel, pirate ships filled with treasure hunt games and scallywags, and a glorious carousel, among other attractions. \n\nIf you'd look up at the right time you would see dragon-shaped fire lanterns floating midair, aerialists made of stardust and smoke performing breathtaking acrobatics, ghostly fortune-tellers, and many more peculiar things.\nYou would hear festive music and laughter echoing across the skies as the residents begin the merrymaking and join the carnival of the Full Moon. \n\nWill you join them?\n",
