    "description": "This second collection of work from Modern Vintage Photos continues to explore the gifts the universe has given us. \"The Grace of Light\" explored the way light falling on forms and textures can make us feel. \"Pothos and Himeros\" is a series focused on our positive experiences and the hold they have on us.\n\nOur consciousness as humans has the tendency to leave us with a deep need to reconnect and replicate experiences that are euphoric. The feeling resides somewhere in the pit of our belly, and while not completely unpleasant, feels as if it is a force pulling us towards a reenactment. \n\nPothos and Himeros are the Erotes in Greek mythology of Longing and Desire. \n\nThis series of work explores worlds in which two forms give a sense of this human condition. Powerful connections. Passion. Love. Longing and Desire.  We are together in this world, we all feel pleasure and pain, we must practice and grow our empathy.\n",
