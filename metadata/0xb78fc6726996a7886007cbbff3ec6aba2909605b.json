    "description": "Do you contemplate reincarnation and how often do you meet people whom you feel you've known all your life, or maybe even more than one?\n\n\"10 eternal questions\" is a piece that not only makes you ponder about the principles of the universe, but also our role in the process of reincarnation. The idea for the art emerged as a result of communication with a neural network, which generated the eternal questions of reincarnation to which we still have no answers. A planet in the background is depicted as a symbol of eternal reincarnation.\n\nThe piece is not just a digital art but also a challenge to reflect on our role in creating the world.\n\nHow do you answer these questions to yourself?\n",
