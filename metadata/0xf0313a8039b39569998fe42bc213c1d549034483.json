    "description": "WeOwnAMoonbird is an Access Pass. Unlike other 'Moonbird Derivs' WeOwnaMoonbirds are not. They're a collection of 10,000 utility-enabled PFPs that are an Access Pass to a very exclusive and otherwise VERY EXPENSIVE private club membership. It is simple, We own a Moonbird. Every single post/update/announcement/alpha/bulletin from Moonbirds Discord and secret Trait Twitter chats will be populated into our WeOwnaMoonbird Discord using proprietary code we had developed for this project to crawl Moonbirds Channels in real time. Why are we called WeOwnaMoonbird? Well because, We Own A Moonbird.",
