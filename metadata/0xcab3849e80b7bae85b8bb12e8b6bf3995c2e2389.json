    "description": "Timeless started from nothing. There is sand. There are dunes. There is very little human interaction. And yet these particular moments that are brought to life in the desert are not happening in the “void”, they are situated. The images bridge between two worlds and two realities: two visible sets of elements that have not been imagined to collide, or to exist in the same spatio temporalities. The eye is suddenly re-educated to not fear the emptiness of the desert. It is no longer associated with being lost. It is not tied to a local experience yet resonating with local identities beyond the national.",
