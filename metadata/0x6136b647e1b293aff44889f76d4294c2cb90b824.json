    "description": "The curiosity in his eyes looking into my camera reflects how my eyes look back at the world.\n\nI could tell he wondered what all the buttons and gadgets did. He had so many questions about what I did and how the camera worked. I could see his eyes light up with every new piece of information I gave him. I am ready for my own eyes to light up as I open myself up to the world.\n\nMany go from the cradle to grave without ever truly living. On this day, I learned to live. \n\nHave a walk with me through San Juan.",
