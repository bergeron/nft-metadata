    "description": "“A simple idea that raises interesting questions and leads to aesthetically successful results: show up at some of the world’s most visited – and therefore photographed – monuments and sites, turn your back on the very thing you have come to see, and record the view that no one else is interested in. It’s not the same as photographing a famous site from an unexpected angle – from behind the HOLLYWOOD sign, as Robert Frank did in the 1950s – in order to reveal its local or grubby underside. Often, in Oliver Curtis’s Volte-face, the monuments do not even get a look in. What we get, instead, is an idea of what they look at.”   Geoff Dyer\n",
