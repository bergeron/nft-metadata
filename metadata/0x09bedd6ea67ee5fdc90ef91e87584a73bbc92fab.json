    "description": "Libertad, is the 1st \"Flower\" from El Jardin. She is the one who paves the way for others. Those who are too making their way to the Freedom Garden, follow her footsteps. She wears her headpiece with pride, representing leadership, bravery, vulnerability, and confidence. She plants the seed of self-embrace and waits patiently for the others to arise and bloom.\n\n...and she chants: \"you don't need to hide anymore, come out come out, you are LIBRE! LIBRE! LIBRE!. You don't need to hide anymore. The time has come for you to be ALL that YOU were born to BE.\"",
