    "description": "Our life, however long or short, has an impact on other people’s lives; our actions, however small, can create the greatest success or the greatest disaster. Most things are, most of the times, reduced to a simple decision.\n\nThis series presents, as an echography, the path between life and death; the stage that every living being thing passes. These images aim to reduce the human to his physiological nature, excluding what makes the human „a superior animal”: the deciding factor.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people are born and die every day. What was/ will have been their course? what did they make or would have made for the people around them?  It is an infinite chain. \n\nHow are we different from every other person in the infinite chain?  \n \nEcography 1: The „Beginning”, the moment when we are completely dependent on another’s existence, we do nothing, we just breathe because someone else breathes, but this will change soon and we will be an individual „creature”, able to decide.\n",
