    "name": "Lupins BOA#1",
    "description": "Lupins\n\nTime-lapse duration: 81 hours\n\nThe name is derived from Lupus, the Latin word for wolf, but the reasons for this are not clear. It may be that in ancient times, Europeans noticed that lupins grew on barren soil where no other plants ventured and it was thought that they had in some way attacked them. In fact Lupins can live in such poor conditions because the plants can transfer nitrogen from the air to to the soil via their roots. The Lupin flower represents happiness, appetite, creativity and imagination. ",
