    "name": "Flowers for Nihilists",
    "description": "The Inspiration: \n\nCurled up on the couch reading a book on nihilism, my gaze shifted to a vase of purple roses wilting on the coffee table. I became curious about how a nihilist would perceive cut flowers and decided to explore my empathetic instinct. \n\nThe Poem: \n\nThis piece is meticulously composed in the form of an American sonnet—a fourteen line poem with a rapid progression of theme in the last two lines. It speaks of how we define life and presents the concept of eternity as being relative to our own existence.\n\nThe Photograph: \n\nThe backdrop is an image I captured of the ground—covered with clover and a scattering of blossoms fallen from trees. The juxtaposition between the living clover and the dead flowers serves as a tonal, textural background.\n\nThe Narration: \n\nThis piece includes my audio narration. It is also recommended that you mute my voice and speak the words aloud. To do so is to embody this poem, and you become the art.\n\nFeatured in the 50th issue of \"The Tickle.\"\n",
