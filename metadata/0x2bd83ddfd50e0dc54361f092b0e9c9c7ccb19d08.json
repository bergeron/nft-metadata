    "description": "The Multiverse: Paradise Planet Aphrodite's Law  \nArtist: Blaise 🔥🔥🔥x Dall-E  \nPhotoshoot & Creation  \nDate:  Oct 23, 2022.  \nThe Metaverse: Paradise Planet Aphrodite's Law\n\nThe Universe is all there ever was, all there is, and all there will ever be.\n\nAphrodite's Law, states that the Amazons of Paradise Planet would be immortal as long as no man sets foot on their planet.\n\n“What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. \nAll that we love deeply becomes a part of us.”  \n-Helen Keller\n\nThe multiverse theory suggests there’s more to the universe than what we see. \n\nMultiverse Theory postulates that the vast region of space we call the Universe is not all that exists. Other universes may exist in parallel dimensions.  Today we explore an undersea paradise in the Multiverse as imagined by Blaise🔥🔥🔥.\n\nMore Art from Blaise 🔥🔥🔥 here :  \nwww.ArtByBlaise.com",
