    "description": "Brood X - 17 Yr Cicadas, May 2021 Costa Rica\n\nOnce every 17 years, millions of cicadas emerge to sing us their song.  \n\nCicadas represent: Patience & Synchronicity.\n\nViveka in Sanskrit विवेक means Discernment.\n\nA 17-year cicada hatches from its egg, burrows into the ground and spends the first 17 years of its life later to emerge from the ground and lives for 4 weeks before dying.  \n\nThe hypnotic sound of the cicadas has always fascinated me. The frequency evoked during the 2021 emergence was particularly strong and I felt compelled to record it. I captured the symphony of sound and gave it to my wife, music producer Elyse Rich. \n\nElyse says that since childhood she's felt strongly connected and oddly attracted to their haunting sound. She took my original field recordings and polished them up.  Inspired by the sound of the Cicadas, Elyse created an original LoFi song &  embedded it in my original recording.",
