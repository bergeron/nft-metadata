    "description": "Happy to be back\n\nFirst song I made for 2023 top to bottom. (1/24-1/26)\nAlso the first one after fully recovering from my Ear ordeal.\nStill have my hearing, but some loss in volume sensitivity. \n(Gotta stop blasting music)\n\nWant to maintain a regular release schedule - Optimally Bi-Weekly,\nIf not monthly.\nNonetheless, I'm excited to share.\n\nWondered what it would be like to put some soul, pop & punk together with a lil' 1970s flavor..\n\nIt's a bit of a sad song, but against upbeat rhythm & soothing melodies..\n\nIt might feel like a love song to you, but tbh I wanted to write from the perspective of Adam, being kicked out the Garden of Eden.\n\nI'm digging this flow of releasing, everything different than the last.., as I build in the traditional sense getting ready to tour. - Every drop on here should serve all the easter eggs I'll ever make.\n\"Life's a box of chocolates.\"\n\nHope you enjoy this",
