    "description": "This is an extremely person piece for me.  \nA self portrait.  \nWhen my newborn child can do nothing but scream and I can do nothing to soothe and help my wife. \nWhen the love of my life is wilting away and there's no help I can offer because I can't breast feed.  \nThe feeling of being trapped, watching your best friend waste into an emotional nothingness because of something so small and innocent and overwhelming.\n\nThis is the realization of internal change I've gone through when I try to see who I am. \nLove is amazing  \nBut sometimes it can leave you feeling like you don't know who you are.\n\nRemember to not lose yourself in the harshness of now.",
