    "description": "Basic Bats is a character collection of 6000 ERC-721 NFTs paired with a play-to-earn NFT based mobile game. The Basic Bats mobile game is nearing completion and will soon be available and free to play on iOS and Android devices. These NFTs have not used generative AI and are completely drawn and curated by hand. Owning a Basic Bat NFT will allow you to play the mobile game with YOUR character, 3D rendered and playable, as well as giving you access to the competitive community leaderboard. We will be rewarding the top 5 players on the Basic Bats community leaderboard EVERY WEEK with a split of $1000 in ETH.",
