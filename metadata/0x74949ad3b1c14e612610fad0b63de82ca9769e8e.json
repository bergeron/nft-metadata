    "description": "This nebula is the result of a generative art process.\n\nIt is the result of the random and unpredictable nature of the Universe.\n\nThis explosion of pixels followed a series of partially random parameters which gave birth to this artwork.\nIt will therefore be impossible to recreate it again, which makes it unique.\n\nI like to think that its beauty comes from the complexity of its creation process.",
