    "description": "The Eagle Nebula is a spectacular column of gas and dust raising from a region in the Constellation of Serpens where new stars are born. In this artwork, a tree on Earth represents, similarly, a new life. The kaleidoscope symmetry reminds a Rorschach projection which adds a surprise effect that leaves space to individual interpretations. \n\nScience facts: new stars are born in clouds of cold hydrogen. In such dynamics clouds of dust and gas are pushed away and form the pillars. A band of massime, hot, young stars (off the top of the image) emits the ultraviolet light we can see at the top of the pillars. \n\nThe artwork includes a reinterpretation of the image of the Eagle Nebula as pictured by ESA/Hubble. \n\nOriginal Artwork by @federicart\n2048x2048 pixels",
