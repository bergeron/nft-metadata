    "description": "On 01/29/12 I lost my Dad, Thurman Bliss, to an accident.   He was only 67 and it shook my world.   This piece is dedicated to him. \n\nMy Dad was a farmer but he really enjoyed painting and  playing guitar in a rock band.   When I was a little he would let me sit in his basement studio and he'd play music for hours.    At bedtime he made up wild stories for my brother and I, a different one every night.\n\nThis piece was inspired by one of his favorite TV shows, \"Star Trek\".  Specifically the episode \"All Our Yesterdays\" where people could go through portals to different times in a planet's history.  \n\nThis character (I may write her story someday) appears in a few of my renders and these \"portals\" lead to six unique worlds that I've created...\n\nThey are...\n“Extrasolar” (flipped horizontally) \n”The Beginning of the End“\n“The Fisherman“\n“Planitia“\n“Tropical Moon of Thetis“\n”Phraxis Moon“\n\nMy Dad taught me to dream of other worlds and I know he's out there somewhere.
