    "description": "Here are 5,000 middle fingers, for free, from me (Josh Hart) to you. Inspired by a tweet accusing me of preparing for a money grab, this collection is a statement against celebrity cash grabbers entering the NFT space without serving the community. This project is for those who believe my NFT interest is sincere and those who donâ€™t. Be on the lookout for future airdrops and perks for finger holders. Happy collecting!",
