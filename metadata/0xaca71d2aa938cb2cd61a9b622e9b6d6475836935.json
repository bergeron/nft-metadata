    "description": "I've always been captivated by how human beings express themselves, and how this self-expression aligns with identity. \n\nIn my time as a portrait photographer, I've often found that jewellery is a way for people to express their sense of identity.  Jules, pictured here in my trademark monocolour style, is wearing a jewelled ring which is a family heirloom, passed down to her - she is quite literally looking at us through a physical representation of her self-identity.\n\nCollectors of this NFT are eligible to receive a print (A1 or smaller) of this image.
