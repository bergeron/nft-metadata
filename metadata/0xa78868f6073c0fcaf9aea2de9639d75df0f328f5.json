    "description": "This was a cool little tree I discovered while exploring the coast of Oahu. I loved the way it just sat out in the open, completely separated from what surrounded it. I decided to go with a pinkish tone to the image to make these infrared leaves feel like cherry blossoms. Off in the distance is a man enjoying the view. I considered removing him from the image in-post but I liked having that extra bit of scale and context to this image. It makes you think about the story of the person and what led them to being here. Whatâ€™s going through their mind as they stare off into the horizon?",
