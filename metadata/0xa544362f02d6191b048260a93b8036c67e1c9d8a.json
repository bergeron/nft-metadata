    "description": "This work has more the 10 Awards on Photo Contests.\n\nThe photo was taken in Belém, a noble area of Lisbon giving onto the River Tagus and gardens as neighbours ... a \"World of Culture\" surrounds you.\n\nIt was in the middle of the day, in the weekend. There’s nothing more refreshing for city-dwellers than a day out in contact with nature. It feels great to leave the noise of cars behind and forget the hectic pace of daily routine. To have a picnic on the grass and hear birds chirping, to take some photos, to read a book in the shade of a tree or wander aimlessly – these small pleasures add to our wellness.\n\nThe idea was also to share the beautiful light we have in Lisbon. Steeped in history and culture, this enchanting ‘city of light’ boasts a natural luminosity and effortless charm unlike any other in the country and has become a popular European destination for its exciting diversity, beautiful sites and enviable, sunny climate.\n",
