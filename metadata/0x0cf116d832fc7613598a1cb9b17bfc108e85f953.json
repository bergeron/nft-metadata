    "description": "Rocatarpeya has always tried to \"inhabit space\", take a place as an aesthetic reference and translate it, use the immediate, what happens next to us. With this same foundation, Rocatarpeya expands in the metaverse through this Cunaguare character, inspired by Venezuelan fauna and without gender traits, by the hand of its creator and collaborator  Gremiana in this project. The character exhibits a collection of bodysuits 8 prints in total part of our GoogleMaps inspired capsule.",
