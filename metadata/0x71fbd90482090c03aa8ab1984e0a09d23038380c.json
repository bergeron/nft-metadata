    "description": "Imagine you’re viewing this from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon…\n\nGrowing up watching Star Wars, I always loved “Hyperspace”. Something about the stars transforming into vibrant streaks of white light just mesmerizes me. It’s not disorientating or uncomfortable, just a kind of exciting bliss.\n\nI experience a similar bliss waking up in the middle of the night, on a backcountry trip. Your body tells you to go back to sleep, while the photographer in you fills with adrenaline knowing what’s to come.\n\nThe night of this shot, I was in one of these euphoric moments. Only a couple steps away from my tent at 2:00AM, having awoken only a minute prior. My thoughts of sleep did not last long, removed by the cool breeze coming off a restless Pinto Lake.\n\nListening to the sound of the soft waves lapping on the rocks and the rhythm of a mechanical shutter opening… and closing… opening… and… I was no longer on a beach in the Rockies, but “In A Galaxy Far, Far Away”.\n\nPray before you play,\nKeats",
