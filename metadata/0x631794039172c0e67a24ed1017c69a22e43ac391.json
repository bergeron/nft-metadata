    "description": "Augustus Ferraris was the first Roman emperor to enter Rome in a convertible, not a chariot, after a conquest. He thought it will make him an absolute God, in people's eyes. \nBut the mob didn't like the smell of gasoline, didn't like the noise it made. Above all, the mob hated the car was a rental. \nThey threw the convertible into the Tibrus River. Augustus Ferraris was exiled and his name was erased from history. \nâš¡\n1/1\n3:2\n8064 X 5376\n23 MB   \nAI-collaborative ",
