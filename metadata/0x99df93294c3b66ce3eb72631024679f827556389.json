    "description": "Personal Space 2021, Art and Music by Joy Jo, 30sec, 2021\n\n\nBeyond those days when I was suffering from longing for my own space, these days, I have several spaces where I can lay down my body and thoughts comfortably.\n\nInstead of anger and lack, gratitude and awe permeated the reconstructed mindscape.\n\nIn my 20s, I thought of the universe as an extension of my personal space, but in my mid-30s, my universe entered a period of stability, ascension, and immersion.\n\n\n[Note] This NFT is the 'Revised Video' version of the 'Physical Painting' and it doesn't include the physical canvas piece below.\n\n*본 NFT는 아래 실물 회화를 기반으로 재구성한 비디오 작품이며, 실물 캔버스 작품은 본 NFT에 포함되지 않습니다.  \n\n우주, 개인적 공간의 확장 |  Personal Space, Acrylic on canvas, 100×100cm, 2011",
