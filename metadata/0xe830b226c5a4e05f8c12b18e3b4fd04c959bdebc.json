    "description": "This piece visually represents the feeling of settling into content. Embracing all the flowing emotions and questions while simultaneously allowing them to wash through you. Allowing both deep and shallow thoughts. Allowing yourself to be submerged in it all, while you observe. Sometimes it may feel scary to be so deep down, but understand that creativity manifests itself in the deep. Feel them, then let it all wash away. ",
