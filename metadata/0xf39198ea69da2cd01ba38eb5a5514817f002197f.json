    "name": "Danger Skirt at Jeremy Scott's Fashion Show",
    "description": "New York, 2012 - I spotted this model right after Jeremy Scott's fashion show and loved her sequined DANGER skirt. \n\nThis was 2014, at the height of the street fashion frenzy and photographers would run to shoot the fashion flock's \"arrivals\" and \"departures\" outside of New York Fashion Week shows. \n\nMany models would vamp for us outside after a show and these candid photos catapulted a number of them to icon status. Jeremy Scott's fashion shows are a hot ticket as the VIPs get one of his famed Longchamp totes, which you see over her shoulder. I'm drawn to capturing the quirkier moments with personality vs chasing down the perfect shot and have many more to come. \n\nI'll also be selling some specific photo rights, so keep your eye out for some surprises.
