    "name": "Centaurea breviceps",
    "description": "Centaurea breviceps is included in the list of unique plants that may disappear forever due to the war in Ukraine from 2022.\n\nThe diversity of Ukraine's natural landscapes creates conditions for rare and endemic species, that is, those that are common in very limited areas. Such species can only be found in one place and nowhere else on the planet.\n\nMilitary action directly destroys vegetation and indirectly destroys natural habitats. For endemic and rare species, each of which requires special growing conditions, such changes can be fatal. Now, due to hostilities on the territory of Ukraine, many rare plants are under the threat of extinction. This work calls for attention to this problem.\n\nUnique work in a single copy!\n\nTogether with the purchase of NFT, the buyer receives the original work painted on canvas with acrylic.\nThe size of the work is 98 x 92 cm.",
