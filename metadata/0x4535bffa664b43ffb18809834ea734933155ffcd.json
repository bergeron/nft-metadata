    "description": "   The blue snail in this picture was transformed from a real snail surface. Its slowness and sticky saliva is just like human life. It leaves traces wherever it goes and moves very slowly against time. Rick, on the other hand, does not admire the appearance of the snail, on the contrary, he looks at the breasts of the woman in front of him.\n1068x1068 Px ",
