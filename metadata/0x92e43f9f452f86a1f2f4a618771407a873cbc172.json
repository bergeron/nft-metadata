    "description": "One man among a group of colonists finds his friends dying and his enemies closing in on him, but his death might be the opportunity he needs.\n\nGreg saw new hope in the thought of being one of the first humans to live in space. He could escape the slums and his life of crime, forget all of his worries and guilt, and start over. But what started as a colonization mission soon became a horror story. Their ships crashed, something in the air started causing strange deaths, and he was quick to make enemies.\n\nAt death’s door, he thought he was done for.\n\nAll that changed, however, when locals helped him to transform. He woke up to discover that he had a new body of living metal and a glass dome where his head should have been. This new form was confusing, but the discovery of his new powers was thrilling.\n\nHe took the fight back to those who had wronged him, collecting weapons and trophies—in the form of skulls—along the way. He earned himself a reputation and a following, and is now a force to be trifled with.\n\n Watch out, anyone remaining among the colonists. Steer clear of the one they call GREED.\n\n [View Fullscreen](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTbbyvHzA9E6ehF3dhqcrE7VSGExXUvkov3qDtAGCzUgz)",
