    "description": "The photographs in Selected People are fabrications that are also truthful documents. These composite photographs are scrupulously additive: I've changed nothing in the original scene, only selected what to keep in and what to leave out. My work shows a particular place over time and reveals a surprising world--sometimes orderly, sometimes chaotic--that is visible only with a camera. \n\nThis image is part of the Fellowship Trust Collection. All carbon emissions from the minting of these pieces have been offset via several initiatives supported by the Trust.",
