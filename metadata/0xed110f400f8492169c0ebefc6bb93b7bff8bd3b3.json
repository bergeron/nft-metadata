    "description": "The second set of 10 sonic vignettes from my album \"Old Friends New Cities\" is a collaboration with Ukrainian movement artist, Rudo. The first time I saw Rudo dance online I was awestruck by his totally original style of movement â€“ it was flowing, angular and raw.\n\nIn late 2022, Rudo arrived in Berlin from Kiev, and we immediately began a series of collaborations.\n\nWhat you're seeing is the first fruit of those collaborations. Set against a backdrop of Brutalist architecture, we captured Rudo moving improvisationally to the music of \"Old Friends New Cities\", and then curated the most impactful fragments into bite-sized infini-loops. There is no post production done beyond reversing Rudo's organic freestyle.\n\nI hope you'll enjoy it,\n-dessauer",
