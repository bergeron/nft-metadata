    "description": "I love putting antwoman inside the works of the great masters of art and thus say something about them and about the art world in general. In this series antwoman makes a tribute to one of the most esteemed and important artists of the 20th century - Andy Warhol.  \nWhat he did changed the art world. He was fascinated by advertising and celebrities & by the idea of people as brands or consumer products. What is happening now really reflects his vision. We are all consumer products in some way. \nHis art is playful and fun. He was not afraid to experiment and did not address what the critics said. Why do only one painting if you can do several, each in different colors?! I wanted to celebrate this approach because I think in art it is important to try and play. That's how you get to the really interesting things. \nThis series contains 3 videos, each inspired by another style or work by Warhol, and a dynamic NFT created using AsyncArt, which is already sold.",
