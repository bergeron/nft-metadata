    "description": "This is a photograph of Cape Agalina, located on the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria. \n\nI was hoping to get some shots at sunset, but when I got there, the sun had already set. I decided to fly the drone, despite the lack of light and this was the moment where my love for blue hour was born. The scene was moody, dark and somewhat lonely, without the light distracting us. \n\nThis was the moment where I realised what I was looking for in my art, and thats why this is the first image of my collection.\n",
