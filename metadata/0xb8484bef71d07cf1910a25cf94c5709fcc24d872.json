    "description": "I wrote \"In My Mind\" as a way to express my struggles with mental illness and depression that I’ve dealt with for most of my life. It was a cathartic process, to put into words the thoughts and feelings that had been swirling inside my head for so long. It wasn't until I started writing this song that I truly realized the extent of how freeing it felt to transmute that energy. \n\nI put my heart and soul into this song, and I hope that it will resonate with others who have struggled as well. I want people to know that they are not alone in their struggles and that there is always hope for a better tomorrow. The song ends with a sense of hope, and it's the message I want to convey, that no matter how hard it gets, there's always a way to break free from the depression and find the strength to move forward.\n\n\"IN MY MIND\" is a very raw and personal song that I hope will bring comfort to those who need it, and remind them that even in the darkest days, there's always hope for a better tomorrow.\n\n\nProduced by Solo Otto \nWritten by Solèy \nCo-written by Nhataniel Placide\nMixed/Mastered by ZO ",
