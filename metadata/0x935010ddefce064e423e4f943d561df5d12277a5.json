    "description": "This is a handcrafted spin-off from the Genetic Chain Serene Animo collection: https://geneticchain.io/project/11.\n\nThe basis for the collection is the work of German mathematician David Hilbert. His discovery of his type of space-filling curves in 1891 inspired Atara to explore its unique, fractal properties. With a Hausdorf dimension of precisely two, this piecewise linear curve fills all of the space in any dimension if subdivided long enough. Curves like this reflect the eternal search for truth in the universe. Every spectrum, the one-dimensional range of sound, the two-dimensional canvas of a picture, and the three-dimensional extents of a sculpture are all taken by the one formula, the one curve, to fill them all with life.\nAnchored on the Hilbert curve as a concept, Atara defines different distance fields to represent the curves best in this medium of procedural art. \n\nThese NFTs proceeds will support Unchain Ukraine, humanitarian aid for the brave in need. \n",
