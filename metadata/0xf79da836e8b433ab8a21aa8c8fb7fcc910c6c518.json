    "description": "Fire. It's at the core of everything we do in glassmaking. Heat is integral to what we do and fire provides it. It's been said that all glassblowers are born pyromaniacs and it's hard to refute we all like playing with fire in some way or another.\n\nOne of the big innovations of late 20th and early 21st centuries is the advent of torch use. They allow us to spot heat with a precision never before seen and have become a staple of the studio glass movement. And similarly the fluffy torch video has become a staple of social media accounts across the glass realm, whether it be the minimalist closeup of the torch idling or the torrent of flames emanating from a torch head as it heats a piece.",
