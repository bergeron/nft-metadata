    "name": "Roy Double",
    "description": "ROY DOUBLE depicts a reconciliation with the queer self. Drawn from life in charcoal, a standing figure gazes down at his seated double, gently resting a hand on his arm. It is a collaboration with my husband Roy Joseph Butler.\n\nMany queer people are excluded from foundational experiences on which our society is built. Often, this leads to internal conflict between identity and belonging. The process of creating this image was a moment's pause for Roy and me to reach within and calm this conflict.\n\nTo create the composition, Roy alternated between two poses. One figure was necessarily absent, while the other pose was held. Whilst the two could never connect physically, the creative process allowed me to bring them together in charcoal. The elements of touch and gaze were crucial in cementing this connection.\n\nThis NFT was minted to celebrate my solo exhibition in London LIFE IN CHARCOAL, which features the original charcoal drawing (50 x 70 cm).",
