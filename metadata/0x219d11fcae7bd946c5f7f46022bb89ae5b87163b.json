    "description": "Kuchisake-onna \n\nAn malevolent spirit in Japanese folklore. \nA beautiful girl with long, straight, black hair who, according to legend,  she partially covers her face with a hand or mask.\n\n\nAs a vengeful spirit, she would hide behind bushes and haunt people late at night.\nThe woman would appear before a human and ask him whether she was beautiful or not. If the human  answered \"no,\" she would immediately kill him with her big scissors, and if \"yes,\" she would show her cut-up mouth.\nThe woman will ask the human if she is beautiful now, but if the human persists and answers \"no,\" she will kill him. However, if the human answers yes, the woman will mutilate his mouth from ear to ear with her scissors. \n\n5485 x 3500px\n500dpi\n\n09.02.2022",
