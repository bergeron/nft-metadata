    "description": "If you try to find out what a Kyiv cake is, then you will probably stumble upon a bunch of wrong recipes and a Wikipedia article dry as a cracker.\nBut this is only part of the truth.\nKyiv cake is not a dessert. Itâ€™s a symbol of the city on a par with chestnut leave, architectural and cultural sights that the capital of Ukraine is rich in.\nIt was the Kyiv cake that was one of the gifts from Ukraine for the 70th anniversary of Brezhnev.\nFor 66 years, the Kyiv cake has been the main souvenir that is taken from the central station to all corners of the world.\nLike everyone who leaves Kyiv, I want to take my Kyiv Cake with me.",
