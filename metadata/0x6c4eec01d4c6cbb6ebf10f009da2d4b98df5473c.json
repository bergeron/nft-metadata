    "description": "I'm sorry but calling you a goddess would be an insult to your name pretty lady.\nThe gods are perfectly flawed beings that punish and destroy when they are not showed love...\nYou are far greater than that love...\nTonight as the stars shines bright,\nI set sail to the great beyond in search for a title you can call your own,\nOne that has never been heard by the ears of man \nnor the ears of angels above nor the gods themselves.",
