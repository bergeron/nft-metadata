    "description": "This collection is inspired by the minimalistic Japanese Ma (間) philosophy. Japanese culture and their traditional paintings alongside their flower arranging styles have been sources of inspiration to us.\nThe concept of “Ma” is something that relates to all aspects of life.\n\nIt has been described as a pause in time, an interval or emptiness in space.\nWe need the absence of something to understand it more profoundly.\nIf we want to understand light, we must first understand darkness.\n\nIf we want to understand a work of art such as photography, a painting or a piece of music, it is better to examine its absence in their empty spaces.\n\nAs stated by the great Mozart:\n“The music is not in the note but in the silence between”.\n\n\n1/1\n5013 × 5013\n\nCreated 2022",
