    "description": "\nOne of the series I started drawing in 2019 when the midlife crisis came to me, then it was the time of corona and isolation which was good for self-drawing and then in 2021 I found myself in a self-built hat on a mount without a lot of people around where this particular drawing was made on a folder page from a business binder that I found in dumpster, from a mirror that I found in dampster, in my hat built from things found in dumpster.\n\nI am really fascinated with the process of drawing myself drawing myself) because it is not just a process of creating pictures but rather a way to step aside and have a look at myself from the outside.",
