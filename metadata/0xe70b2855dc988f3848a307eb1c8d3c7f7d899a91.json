You can choose to rock something that was made in bulk or, you can choose art that is handcrafted and made to your liking by a man who's been making art his entire life.\n\nCircus Beast is a group of limited edition, hand crafted, custom sculpted and, custom painted  NFT's originally made from commissioned derivatives but, breaking off into an independent series of one of a kind sculptures.\n\n(Full IP rights are granted only to the current owner of each NFT)",
