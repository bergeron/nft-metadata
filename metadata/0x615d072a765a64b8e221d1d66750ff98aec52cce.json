    "description": "Have you ever noticed that when something is unclear or not fully visible it seems much more mysterious and exciting? I think it's because it leaves some space for imagination, so we can design the rest in our heads, adjust it to our vision of beautiful and look at it through our own lens...\n \nCyber Bloom No1 is inspired by Australian nature and delicate eucalyptus flowers. The scene is 3D modelled from scratch to visualize the contrast between clear vision and effect of distortion - great example of how perspective can change our perception of just about anything.",
