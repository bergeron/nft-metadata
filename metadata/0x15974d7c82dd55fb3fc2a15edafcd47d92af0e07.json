    "description": "The in-camera installations in this series of photographs are inspired by locust swarms, starling murmurations and other self-organizing systems found in nature. Made from manufactured items like cups, plates and post-it notes, each installation is an experiment in juxtaposition, an attempt to create something that is simultaneously in harmony and in conflict with its environment. The final photographs, shot on 4x5 film and reproduced with little to no digital manipulation, press the viewer not only to contemplate our dysfunctional relationship with nature, but also to envision a future in which natural and human-made systems are integrated and sustainably intertwined.",
