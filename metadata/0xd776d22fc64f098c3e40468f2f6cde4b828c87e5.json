    "description": "(2023) - A reflection from deep inside the soul. \n\nThis work is in some ways, a self portrait. It shows a void, of dark blends, blue, black and violet. The color blended paint bits, seeping through the dark colors, representing that it isn’t always bad, there are great times full of love, development and character, the bits of exposed canvas show times where you feel unfinished, not able to form any ideas because you feel so lost in absence, it feels so hard to even reflect on your trauma, because you don’t even have the ability to call in on it and reflect. It’s almost as the memory is gone, unable to form. \n\nThis work is a full physical work, brought into the digital world, using the blockchain as a form of authenticity.\n\ndimensions - 101.6cm x 152.4cm (3.5ftx5ft)\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing this piece along with the physical canvas, please get ahold of me via twitter or email at studio@dijiact.com / additional fees and information will need to be provided. I will be happy to answer ANY questions or concerns regarding this.",
