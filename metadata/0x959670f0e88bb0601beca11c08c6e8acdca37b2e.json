    "description": "As it has been said, the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched but only felt and music is such. Music has been my  biggest and constant inspiration behind creating visual art. \n\n“Painting Serenade - Genesis” is the inception of the collection, “Painting Serenade”. Through each artwork in this collection, I try to capture my perception and feelings for a song in a painting inspired by its lyrics and melody.  \n\nMay the silence of my paintings sound like music to you; Music that we adore, music that connects us, music that drives us and music that we live for.\n\n\n\nDigital Oil painting\n4500 × 4500px",
