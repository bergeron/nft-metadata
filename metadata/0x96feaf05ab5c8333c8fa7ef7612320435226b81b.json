    "description": "Tigers are the main actors of this year. Other than it’s attractiveness to be drawn but also its philosophy that makes a dashing, strong and powerful impression. I feel I have a connection with the tiger in terms of its aloof nature. The Tiger symbol has also been firmly embedded in the traditions of the Sundanese people, and as someone with Sundanese lineage, growing up, I had several encounters with old stories and myths about Prabu Siliwangi who was believed to have disappeared, turned into a tiger and lived peacefully the rest of his life in a mountain. What I find quite interesting in this narrative is the message behind it, namely as humans we must protect the environment. Is that simple. An old message that are hundreds of years old but still relevant today and perhaps for more years to come. Left me with a hope that one day I could balance all the sins I have committed to our old 'home' and make amends.\n\n2587 × 2158  \n00:48  \nOriginal music.",
