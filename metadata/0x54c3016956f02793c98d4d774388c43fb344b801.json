    "name": "A New Beginning",
    "description": "As the breeze rustles the Sakura trees, the delicate petals flutter with ease, a sight so breathtaking and serene, a moment that's cherished and often seen.\n\nA new beginning, fresh and bright, a canvas to paint, a life to sow.\n\nA New Beginning -\n1903 x 2734 px\n\n\nThis is the first work after I finished the Everyday Girls collection on OpenSea. A new beginning, a new collection which come at the right time with Spring season in Japan.\n\nThe first buyer will be granted the acrylic stand version of this work as a bonus, sent physically to your home.",
