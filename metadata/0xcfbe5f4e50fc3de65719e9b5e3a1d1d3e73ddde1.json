    "description": "This work was made by 3D scanning the person I love the most in my life. After the face scan, I redesigned the metal design for the body part. The starting point of my career was the Ghost in the Shell I watched when I was a child, which had a great influence on me, so this work carries my emotions about the past and the future, I hope you will like it",
