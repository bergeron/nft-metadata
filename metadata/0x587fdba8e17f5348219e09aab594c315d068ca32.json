    "description": "In this ongoing series Minimal Ways, I give my attention, admiration and companionship to lone and plain subjects that are out in the open and seldom noticed.\n\nThese seemingly simple and mundane images remind me of times when I was younger and wanted to be seen and heard by peers and others. The times I had felt passed by, or dismissed as part of the background.\n\nImages captured 2021 - present.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holders free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
