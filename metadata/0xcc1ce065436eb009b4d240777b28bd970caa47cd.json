    "description": "There are four stages in life. Birth, perception, becoming a meta and death. These phases are inevitable. We open our eyes to the world and try to understand it. We observe and sometimes ask questions. Then we try to decide what kind of meta we will become with our so-called free will. No matter how, we will become a meta. All humanity is a meta. All human beings are Meta-Being.\n\nDuration: 05.10 min\n\n\nCreator: Yiğit Erkol\n\nModel: Asrın Bianchi\n\nOriginal Score: Yağız Oral\n\nProject Manager: Yaren Gülce Yıldız\n\nPoster Design: Burçak Tanrıverdi & Yaprak Kaynar\n\nAssistants: Begüm Erel & Özgür Özder\n\nMake-Up: Kseniya Aydoğan\n\nStudio: No:14 Studio\n",
