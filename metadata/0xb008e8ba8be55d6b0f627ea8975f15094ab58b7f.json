Letâ€™s harness the power of the community in Web3 to show our support for ending these senseless acts of violence by supporting organizations that are critical in the fight to end gun violence. All proceeds from the mint and secondary sales go directly to the ETH wallet via smart contract to Everytown for Gun Safety.",
