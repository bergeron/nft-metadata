    "description": "_code, identity or poetry?\n\nFrom the first time I received a generated seed phrase to hold and keep, I was obsessed with its mysterious meaning (or lack of), and above all, with the ambiguity that could lead to many interpretations - like good poems usually do.\n\nSeed Phrase Poetry was born from a desire to create experimental poetry using only BIT 39 words. Like a contemporary oracle, the access key to freedom is all about self interpretation.\n\nThis first series of 12 poems uses only 12 words, relating to the 128 bits of entropy.\n\nThis is seed phrase poetry #1.\n",
