    "description": "Title: Risk  \nEditions: 1/1  \nArtist: YhQ Photos  \nLicense: Extended Editorial  \nResolution: 5498 x 8247\n\nThe nature of astrophotography is such that when you have those specific set of conditions; weather, moon phase, milky way alignment, you have to risk your time to make the most of them. \n\nThis was taken at Tongariro National Park, a 5 hour drive to one of the darkest locations in New Zealand, but also one of the most unpredictable, with hourly changes to weather forecast. This area can go from clear skies to blizzard conditions in a blink of an eye. \n\nLuckily all the planning came to fruition and the risk paid off, with one of the best skies I have had the fortune of being under, not a breath of wind nor cloud to be seen, and only a light sprinkling of frost underfoot!\n\nBeing able to capture these images for the world to see, is just one part of the motivation, the other is trying to preserve these wild places for generations to come. With this being the case 10% of the sale will be going to local conservation charities.  \nNot only that, but the collector of this piece will get a signed A3 sized print.\n\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
