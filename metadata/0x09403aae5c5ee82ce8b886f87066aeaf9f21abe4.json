    "description": "Nightmare on Sua’s Street is my genesis drop. This piece is a self-portrait created to mimic Freddy Krueger from the movie series Nightmare on Elmstreet. The original was created in 1996 using a 0.05 mechanical pencil and 2B lead on white mylar. Yes, I said 1996, before there were selfie sticks, profile pics, and dinosaurs. This piece has never been published or been previously made available to the public.",
