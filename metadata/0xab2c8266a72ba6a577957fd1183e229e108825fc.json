    "description": "RCS Collective started with the Creative Gallery competition announced by Deca and XCOPY on 20th May 2022\n\n5 individuals from across the globe connected and set out to create the most legendary XCOPY tribute that Deca could handle (we definitely pushed the limit for how much one gallery could take).\n\nThe gallery itself was the starting point of a treasure hunt, the winning prize for which was a Right Click Share Pixel (contributed generously by Deca and Bonafidehan after hearing our idea)\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first piece of art to be sold that was created entirely on Deca without any other tool! \n\nA piece of history.\n\nVisit the gallery here: https://deca.art/RCS-Collective/right-click-share",
