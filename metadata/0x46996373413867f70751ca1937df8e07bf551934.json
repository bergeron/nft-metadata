    "description": "After a long day at work, evening drinks with a few folks, long drives past buzzing clubs, a hasty stop at the restaurant of spicy foods, I approach the door of my room and remember the pain of my reality. I step in to experience the beginning of my torment. New Orleans, in the spirit of Mardi Gras. \n",
