    "description": "Do you think it's too crazy to think of looking at the clouds and jumping on them, or plucking them like cotton candy and eating them, sitting on the edge of the moon and shaking your legs when you look at the sky?\nLet it not think, because childhood is the purest and simplest state of feelings and humanity. Children love with the most beautiful feelings that are not self-interested and false.\nLove is a child's smile, it is the flapping of a bird's wings and the green silence of a tree, it is a flow of water foaming. \nThat's why, maybe animals show a more sincere and sweet approach to children. Running with dogs, flying with geese, hugging and caressing their chicks had a place in our childhood.\nWe collected the eggs of geese and chickens from the coop, we took them to graze, we dreamed with them flying in the sky and gave them names. And we all have a friendly companion animal. \nHere is a sample of pure love between a child and geese; with the harmony of all left feet up.",
