    "description": "\"Contained\" is a series of photos created to represent my personal struggle with anxiety and agoraphobia. \n\nIn this sense, what is it to be contained? A belief that by keeping yourself contained from outside forces and from yourself, you drown out the issues that you believe you can no longer face.\n\nYou suffer, comfortably.\n\nYou never lift your head above the water, afraid that you'll feel guilty for breathing.\n\nPhoto is a 5272 × 6591 High resolution JPEG taken on a 42 megapixel Sony A7rII.\n",
