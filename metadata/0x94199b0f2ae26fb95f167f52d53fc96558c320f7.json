    "description": "This series aimed to explore the use of nail polish as a medium to express abstract ideas. I utilised its glossy and viscous nature to create a virtual sculptural piece that elicited a sense of familiarity and unfamiliarity for the audience. With an emphasis on colour, form and abstraction, each piece aimed to evoke specific moods and emotions. The piece, Incognito Mode, to evoke mystery and luxury, using warm colours and soft animation to create a subtle and enigmatic atmosphere. Through experimentation with textures and hues, I was able to imbue the animation with a bewitching character. This series was a unique and challenging endeavour, marking my first attempt at a liquid simulation of this kind.
