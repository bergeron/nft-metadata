    "description": "Today's events prompted us for the creation of this NFT. War is a devastating experience for any of us. It may destroy people physically and from inside, making them strangers even to themselves. \n\nWe used \"burned ground\" as the basis, the core idea of the entire composition. It is something that remains after all the destructive actions and works as a reminder of all war victims.\n\nThe NFT is created in a form original diorama by Minibricks company in a single copy. The cost of NFT includes the cost of diorama and its delivery all around the world. Photos of diorama original are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/unxb496ynrr8jtd/AAAbEIzupc4rNt-yFeO9-M_Ua?dl=0\n\nÂ© 2022 Minibricks. Miniature \"Apocalypse of Today: The Horrors of War\".
