    "description": "'Gorilla in a Pink Mask' NFT, has been split into 10,000 segments magnified x 40. The animated NFT shows the artwork with crosshairs pinpointing the location of each fraction. The other side documents its purity level with a rarity score. \n\n These were calculated by an algorithm that took into account 128 colours. These were then reduced to the pixel intensity of the five colours - pink, dark grey, light grey, ochre and sand. Exposed Walls place no commercial value on these evaluations, rarity is based on colour purity only. \n\nRarity is ranked from 1 - 100 with 1 being the rarest, indicated by the colour of the gorilla head stamp. Below is their occurrence of these in the edition. \n\n Gold: 16 — Silver: 31 — Bronze: 44 — Black: 9909",
