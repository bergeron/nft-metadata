    "description": "Nova Fan Team Club: Meet the NFANs We are a race from a different dimension, one that ventures into the unknown for humans, its located in blerpsmirt galaxy and itâ€™s the 15th planet from our shpplim, we call our home planet Nova. We are an advance race, we have mastered interdimensional communications and achieved peace through blending unity and uniqueness, we respect all life forms. We used to wage wars and almost destroyed ourselves. Only 10.000 of us survived the meerkstref war, but we learned a great lesson: to live in peace we must compete. We have been watching you across the interdimensional cable and fell in love with your sports, video games and overall culture, we are your fans. It has given us a new sensation that you call euphoria, and we want more!",
