    "description": "what started as commission work back in 2021 turned out to be a platinum selling album by 2022. when the original cover was created for \"shiesty season\" in 2021 it featured shiesty holding stacks of cash in front of the place he grew up. this was the first time i had said yes to a commission that required a human like character to be created even with no prior knowledge of doing anything of sorts. fast forward a year later that commission work allowed for me to experiment further and create the very all smilesss character as its known today. so when i was approached to do a new cover for shiesty album going platinum this year it was only right to do an alternative cover along with the new certified cover with the smilesss character and pooh shiesty character meeting for the first time and realizing how much they had a hand in building one another, both certified platinum artists now ::)",
