    "description": "Story: This was a painting in memory of Baby, who passed away in February of 2021. Baby left a huge hole in hearts around him after his passing, including my special friend. Because of the hole that was left, I was motivated to bring some light into during a darker time for friend. This painting was based off a real picture of Baby. I choose this image of him because I think it catpured the highlights of his personality. It was the little wink that I loved! ",
