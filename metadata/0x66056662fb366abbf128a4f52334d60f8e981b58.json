Meaning, a coffee you can drink all day, similar to a cheap fun beer. Crappy beer, you can drink like water, while an IPA knocks you on your feet in one can. Coffee has always been the same. One good cup sends you to the moon, sometimes getting you all shaky and crazy.\n\nThereâ€™s also been this correlation with grandpa coffee where you can drink a pot of Folders coffee all day, feeling nothing. Both have a place, both are awesome.\n\nFor the new Alimo Sessions Blend. I wanted this â€˜grandpa coffeeâ€™ where you drink your crazy cup in the morning to wake you up, then in the afternoon, drink your Alimo sessions blend until dark. \n\nThis is what we created and man it taste good.\n\nThe painting represents a session. All your friends are chilling at the beach, while youâ€™re still frothing out in the ocean surfing. You know that feeling!\n\nIâ€™m also so proud of my friends and honored to be part of their first artists series. This not only introduces the audience to rad art, but also a way to discover new art with damn good coffee.\n\n-----\n\nThe Details:\n\nThe Alimo Sessions Blend is a half caff blend weâ€™ve been working on for a while. Visitor Coffee Roasters sourced from multiple farms in Mexico and Guatemala, and found the perfect blend of smooth taste and an even-keeled buzz of caffeine.  \nWith a creamy and bright body, this blend combines floral and chocolatey notes to keep you sipping throughout the day.\n\nThank you to all my holders and your support. It means the world to me.",
