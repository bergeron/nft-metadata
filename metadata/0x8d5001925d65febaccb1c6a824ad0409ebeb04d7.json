When it came down to actually fulfilling the agreed upon tasks the individual was unable to perform them for a variety of (questionable) reasons I won't get into it. \nThe promise of a refund was eventually offered but as the weeks went by and the excuses of why said refund was not yet granted were getting thinner and thinner I started reinserting myself back into the conversation. Eventually, after weeks of back and forth, the money was repaid and this message was sent to my friend.  \n",
