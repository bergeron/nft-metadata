    "description": "Stop! is a free to claim mint over the festive period (December 2022-January 2023). \n\nIt was captured during NFT NYC in June 2022. \n\nAnd now more than ever, it's just a simple reminder to stop, take stock of your year through the ups and the downs and think about what's to come in 2023! \n\nAs they say, donâ€™t forget to touch some grass :) \n\nOutside of this just being a fun experiment to create my own free mint & smart contract my hope is that this is an easy way for people to interact with a new medium and for as many as possible to share this experience and have fun with it. \n\nIf you want to be kept up to date with any future drops add your details here!\n\nhttps://forms.bueno.art/mlitman",
