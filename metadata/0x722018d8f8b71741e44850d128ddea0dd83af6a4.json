    "description": "the way we live has completely changed & maybe it will stay that way forever\n\nart has commonly served us (Thomas & Ania) as a medium to connect with each other despite the pandemic and political turmoil that is going on around the world\n\nthis collaboration we did is a form of message to everyone out there to hang in there no matter what happens around us, reach out, create, find a common ground and built each other up \n\nmake good use of technology to communicate & share useful information. we could be different (different form of brush strokes), we came from different background and culture (the different characters) and we are fighting our own battles (the smoke, the fire and the leafs) but we came to a common ground, which is the love for illustration and nail that down and came up with our very first collaboration that depicts us embracing our differences :)",
