    "description": "Impregnated since always by the double culture (Japanese by my origins and Western by the country of residence), I have always been confronted with an identity conflict. Educated by my Japanese parents in the tradition of their country, but having always lived in Europe, I gradually cultivated this cultural conflict within me, where I sometimes had trouble defining who I was. I always felt like this foreigner, in Japan or here in Europe, as if I was never in my place - it is surely as a photographer that I finally found my identity. Through this self-portrait, I wanted to express this contradiction in me, this permanent contrast that makes me the person I am today.",
