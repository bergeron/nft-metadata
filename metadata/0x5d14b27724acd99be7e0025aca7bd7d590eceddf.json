    "description": "\"The Dogon man had braved both desert and sea on his journey, and finally arrived in the city of Venice on a dystopian night in 1630. As he drifted through the empty canals, the melodic arias of the Venetian School of Opera floated through the air, a soothing balm after his long and challenging journey. The mysteries of the watery city for him lay ahead, waiting to be unraveled.\n\n1 day Open Edition - New Year's Eve 2023",
