    "description": "Out on a sightseeing expedition in a post-apocalyptic city, the Robot takes us to a grim future where humankind is almost extinct.\n\nWe catch a robot running a security check on a cat for no apparent reason. There's something about cats that subliminally appeals to us, and we're hardwired to respond to their meows and purrs. But are they as innocent as they sound or look?  \n\nIt turns out that cats may have been responsible for the downfall of humankind after all, and as we ponder over what this all means, hundreds of cats walk out of the shadows and surround and spy on humans. They learn about their crypto wallet key phrase and report it to agencies to get them hacked.\n\nIf you see any cats roaming aimlessly on the streets, there's a high chance they're here to spy and scam you. You can report them in the Report Center building.  \n\nThank you,\nFor more information, learn about Cyber Security www.cyberpunksecurity.com",
