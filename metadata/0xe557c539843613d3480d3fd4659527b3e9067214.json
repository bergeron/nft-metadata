    "description": "A monkey found himself in a forest bountiful with mushrooms. He sat upon a nice-looking perch and ate mushrooms until he was content. He began to notice the forest around him changing. In warm waves of colour it would shift around him. He was changing the forest with his will alone, from the inside out. Eventually he came to understand that the forest was changing him. He was not the same as he was before. \n\nArtwork, Editing & Music by Nuclear Samurai \nIntro & Outro Animation by Dura",
