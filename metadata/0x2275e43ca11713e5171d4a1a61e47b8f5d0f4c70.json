    "description": "This work is a gestalt exploration of the eternal aspects of the human experience: an unyielding quest for knowledge, a constant confrontation with our own mortality, and the webs that are woven between all things past, present and future. Ancient truths explored with new technologies. \n\nThis is the artist’s first minted work using AI toolkits. AI has the ability to open gates commonly used to keep ‘outsiders’ away from creative practices and allows for anyone to explore their creative self-expression. This ethos of egalitarianism is central to the artist's own philosophy. Drawing inspiration from the Abstract Art movement that believed that art should be accessible to everyone. \n\nThis piece includes a physical print on canvas, which will be signed and sent to the collector at their request.",
