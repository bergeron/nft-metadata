    "name": "Horror insect (Bibio marci)",
    "description": "Terrible and at the same time beautiful insect on the expanses of Ukrainian lands.\nA warm, sunny day in late May, though a little windy. The grass is green, the bird cherry blossoms. And behind every bird cherry bush there is a swarm of thin black big-eyed flies hiding from the wind. There, in the air, they meet, get acquainted, so that in the future they can have offspring. Sometimes they land on a leaf to rest, where predatory flower spiders or red ants are waiting for them, always ready to take an easy prey. As it turns out, the flies themselves are not flies at all, but belong to the mosquito-foot family (Bibionidae). They have an elongated black body, completely covered with black hairs and large black eyes. This is the appearance of the black fly, aka April fly, aka Mark's bite fly (lat. Bibio marci).",
