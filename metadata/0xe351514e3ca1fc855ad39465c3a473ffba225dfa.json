    "description": "It was a thing very few had witnessed and I wanted to see it too. I wanted to see the Black Panther. People laughed at me when I said that I wanted to see the Panther himself as he was very elusive and tough to sight. But I had no intentions of giving up. I started my journey into the woods of Kabini. It wasn't a matter of a few visits but a series of continuous and regular visits for a long time. It's true what they say \"To be successful, you must fall in love with the journey to success\". That's exactly what happened to me. I fell in love with nature & I got to see great moments & unbelievable sights in the jungles. But never the Panther. There were times when I missed it by a whisker. It was tough luck. But I knew I was getting closer to him with every passing second. After 4 long years, the day finally arrived. That day and moment I waited for so long, I finally saw the Panther himself. He walked on a fallen log when I clicked this very picture. My jungle book dream just got real.",
