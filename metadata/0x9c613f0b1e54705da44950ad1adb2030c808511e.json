    "description": "My life went silent, my heart turned black\nLost somebody that never came back\nMy life full of stress\nA mess\nEverything so meaningless\n\nNevertheless\nI let myself be, who I was, just me\nThe tears that I cried, the emotions that I felt\nThe love in my heart that I held\n\nI found my passion again for story and art\nThis is the beginning, a new start\nA place for my emotions that I feel in my heart\nA poetic place for my stories and art\n\n-----\n\n\nA poem and artwork about the beginning of Poetic Places. This work is inspired by recent life events. The flower underwater symbolises a situation where it feels like you're out of your element. Luckily (and sadly) all things in life are temporary, even the worst parts of your life. ",
