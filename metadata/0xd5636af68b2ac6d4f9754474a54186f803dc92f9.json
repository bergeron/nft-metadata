    "description": "Carved by the wind, these white sand dunes in Northeast Brazil extend for miles and miles, a never-ending sight for the eyes. In this paradisiacal scene, a set of perfectly aligned palm trees, severely damaged by the constant and brutal winds, create perfect harmony, even tough it will be forever altered by nature. Changing constantly. Timeless. Everything seemed to have stopped in time for a brief moment.\n\n\n1/1 edition.",
