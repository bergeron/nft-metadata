    "description": "The past two years felt like an incredible journey.\nThe highs, the lows, the beautiful people I've met along the ride.\nAnd the desire to make music regardless of everything else.\n\nTo put all my FAITH in camoufly was the right decision, I believe.\nBut before camoufly even started I was already trying to improve my craft, expressing myself through music.\nI was trying to find my SOUND, while trying to find myself.\n\n\"INNERSPACE\" embodies the depths of this research.\nAnd it's one of the first songs that came along during my everlong journey through sounds, melting together inspirations and expeirments.\n\nThis is to every single person that came across my music.\nThank you for being here on this journey with me.\nThis is \"INNERSPACE\".",
