    "name": "Pink Balloon Illuminated",
    "description": "On my way home, on the last commute I would take before the first London lockdown, I saw this pink balloon settle on the interior light of the bus and illuminate everything in a warm pink glow.\n\nThen a small hand reached up for it.\n\nA foreboding red light blinked in the distance.\n\n--\n\nNo. 33 from 'Fine Airs and Fine Graces'. My first photo book, which presents a romantic, nostalgic vision of London from my perspective as an Irish immigrant.\n\n‘It’s a London that’s been in my imagination since I was a kid living in rural Ireland. A city that’s refined and elegant, and populated with impeccably dressed men and women. It’s an imagined version of the city that only exists in fleeting moments and sits in contrast to the reality found in other photos in the collection.’",
