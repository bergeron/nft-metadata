    "description": "I was walking the famous W Trek through Torres del Paine in April of 2022 and I had long separated from the rest of my group as they couldn't stand my constant stopping to take pictures.\n\nI loved the solitude and silence of walking through this vast expanse of beautiful nature all by myself. The scene pictured here particularly stands out for me as I got to witness this gorgeous sunset hit the mountains just right and creating a reflection on the lake.\n\nPatagonia is a place I can't wait to return to over and over again to photograph her beautiful landscapes. This shot pictured here is one of my favourites from my last trip.",
