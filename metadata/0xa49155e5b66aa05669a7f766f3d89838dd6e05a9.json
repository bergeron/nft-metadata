You made me smile.\n\nYou made me smile, sweetheart.\n\nIt’s been quite a while since I could smile.\n\nThis world has broken my heart.\n\n\n\nI've \"worked through my feelings,\"\n\nAnd tried \"all the things.\"\n\nI've cried in the darkness,\n\nAnd hidden the pain.\n\n\n\nI’ve felt so alone, and been so bereft.\n\nI prayed, but thought God had left.\n\n\nBut you know the way to cheer me up,\n\nAnd you do it so naturally.\n\nYou bring real joy, when I fear it's lost.\n\nYou’re truly a blessing to me.\n\n\n\nA tug on my hand when I think I’m alone.\n\nA kiss on the face brings such joy.\n\nA hug when I need it so desperately.\n\nA nudge to play with your toys.\n\n\nYou made me smile today, sweetheart.\n\nYou’re there when no one else cares.\n\nI’ll love you forever. You’ll always be treasured.\n\nThrough you, God answered my prayer.",
