    "description": "In the summer of 2021, I was lucky to observe and photograph this pair of sandhill cranes along the Blaeberry river near Golden British Columbia. These cranes gather here while migrating and enjoy the rich supply of food. \n\nGolden is located in the Columbia Valley whose wetlands along the Columbia River are part of the Pacific Flyway, a waterfowl migration route which stretches from nesting areas on the Arctic Ocean to wintering grounds in South America. It is a vital migratory stop over for waterfowl. \n\nThe Blaeberry is a tributary of the Columbia River and a spot where I grew up. I have been to this area many times as a kid and an adult. It is a treat to return as a photographer to view the range of biodiversity it sustains and photograph the animals. \n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
