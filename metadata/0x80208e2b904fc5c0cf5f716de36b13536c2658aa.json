    "description": "Several years ago, seemingly out of nowhere, my mind sort of betrayed me. \n\nI had developed an anxiety disorder that was, in a word, crippling. \n'Panic disorder', my doctor called it. \nIn a nutshell, my mind would play games on me. When explaining it  to people now, I sometimes say to imagine that heightened anxiety or fear you get when something scares you (a feeling that usually dissipates after you realize you aren't in real danger) as a permanent feeling. Like the pit you get in your stomach during the free-fall of a rollercoaster ride, except it never goes away. \n\nAt the time, I felt like I couldn't talk to anyone about what I was feeling because I thought no one would understand- I myself barely understood what was happening to me. It was an incredibly scary and lonely experience, (that fortunately I was eventually able to come out of thanks to therapy and medication), and I really felt like a complete stranger to myself and to everyone around me.  \n\nI wrote 'has anybody seen me?' about that time. \n\nI really hope you enjoy this record. It was produced by two incredible producers, Mike Daley and Mitchell Owens. \n\n10% of the sales of this record will go directly to one of my favorite organizations, The Loveland Foundation, providing opportunity, therapy and healing to communities of color, especially for Black women and girls. Thank you for helping support this incredibly important organization. ",
