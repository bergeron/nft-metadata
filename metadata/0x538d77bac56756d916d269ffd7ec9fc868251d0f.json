    "description": "There are few places left in the world where humanity has not left its unmistakable touch – southern Greenland is one of those places. \n\nOn our way to the Tasermiut Fjord we saw a glimpse of what to expect for the next few days. A sapphire blue ocean & razor sharp ridges in beautiful light. I knew similar scenes just from the Lofoten Islands in Norway, but here the landscape was even more impactful. We soared through the sea surrounded by long, mountainous peninsulas and met some icebergs here and there. To me these little icebergs have been the missing element. Seeing them made me slowly arriving at this place.\n\nHere we leave civilization behind but in exchange get a chance to experience a nearly unknown part of the world.\nJoin me on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to a place most people will never see…",
