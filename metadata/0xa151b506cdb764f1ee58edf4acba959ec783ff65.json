    "description": "In your present timeline - «Timeless-Web 3.0» isn’t developed yet. So it doesn’t have such capacities and for me, it’s very difficult to tell you about everything that is happening now briefly, but I will try. \nI am near the towers where Jerome is expected to return, but he has moved further from the starting point and perhaps we have lost him... forever. \nMy sister, as before, is in orbit at the station, she recently landed nearby and after a long separation, we met each other. She is currently running an important project in Synskeria. She needs you for making tests in accepting data packets via T-Web 3.0. I don’t know what exactly she will send to you, she has a little creative approach, you know her.\nThis terminal is limited by 1000 symbols, I will try to tell you more during next m ‘. Part of the data is corrupted.&@/‘7-)|~||!old object-",
