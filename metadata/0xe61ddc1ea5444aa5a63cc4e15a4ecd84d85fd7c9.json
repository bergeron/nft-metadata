    "description": "“My California” is an indie rock/singer songwriter ode to being fallen out of love with; To being tossed aside, to that feeling of helplessness when an abrupt end falls into your lap. Joffe states: “My partner and I had planned a trip to California, but as our relationship began falling apart, the entire state of California was overridden with the tragedy of the wildfires. My sister lived there at the time, and I remember trying to convince her to get out before it got too bad, while simultaneously mourning the romantic trip I had planned with my partner and everything that loss symbolized.”\n\n“My California” falls somewhere between the first 2 stages of grief in a relationship: denial and anger. With this release, Joffe has uniquely brought in the emotion that comes with gay break ups to mainstream culture. It is not only liberating but intends to give many the power back that can be lost in a relationship.\n\n“I hope it does the same for anyone else who has watched someone fall out of love with them. \"\n\n\n",
