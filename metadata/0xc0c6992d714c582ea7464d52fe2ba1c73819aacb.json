    "description": "Woman’s body as an object and sexual commodity has always been exchanged and seized.\n\n In these works, photographic figures of women’s nude bodies and placing women in a transitory and locative perspective, in lieu of showing the real self of woman, scratches the human spirit and leads us to challenge and judge ourselves.\n\nThe technique of doing the work is photographing the subject, drawing with a pencil, composition on old paper and paperboard, which narrates the past, and the parchment paper used on the figures is a veil for parts of women’s bodies.\n\n This comportment is a sign of the prohibition of showing a woman’s nude body, conducive to heat (sexually provoke) the target community.\n\n**** Presentment of a woman’s nude body (painting, sculpture, photo, etc.) is not allowed in the country where I live.\n",
