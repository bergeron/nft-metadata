    "description": "The volcano of Fogo is the youngest on the island of SÃ£o Miguel, Azores Archipelagos, and was formed 15,000 years ago. It is the result of the last major collapse that occurred approximately 5,000 years ago. The last eruption dates back to 1563.\n\nViewing this place for the first time it's dazzling to say the least. After a breathtaking climb it is impossible to remain indifferent to such beauty of Nature.\n\nThe lagoon's colour changes according to the sky. If the day is dark and cloudy, the lagoon is a grayish green colour. If the sky is clear and the sun is shining, it is a deep, beautiful turquoise blue.",
