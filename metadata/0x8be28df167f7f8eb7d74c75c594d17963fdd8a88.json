    "description": "This horse seemed magical to me when I saw it on the side of the road. I stopped immediately because I was so excited. I slipped, hit my head on the car door, which resulted in a huge bump on my forehead, grabbed my film camera and snapped this image. \nThatÂ´s the story. \nThe bump went away, the image stayed.\n\nNikon FM3A, on Kodak Gold 200\n\n\nEDITION: 1/1\n\nLICENSE: EXTENDED EDITORIAL\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
