    "description": "  In this series, the artist recreates that state of sincerity and balance that we usually go through at an early age, free of social and cultural conditioning, mentally modeled.  Here, moreover, the accumulation of expressions that appear virtually still, partially complicit, are revealed. These overflowing glances, just before pouring out into life, are a way of synchronizing with the truth.\n\"From the Rose to the Truth\", a space of interaction is created. Looks stare, eyes, your eyes. The transparency of these spiritualities, unfolded from painting, in turn from photography, summon and invoke a return, a rediscovery of who we are in the essence of our beings.\n\nThis work was created by Dayron Sim√≥n Rivero.\nIt is an oil painting piece, which was digitized. It is one of the most important pieces of the collection, since it was the first portrait with more spontaneity and gestures that gave way to a new way of doing.\n",
