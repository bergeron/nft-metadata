    "name": "Mercury",
    "description": "Mercury, born on Mount Cileno in Greece, son of Jupiter and the nymph Maia.\nTranscendental god of Roman mythology. Ancient manuscripts say that he stole the arrows\nfrom Apollo, the trident from Neptune and the saber from Mars, all in order to be able to\nnegotiate with them.\nNot for nothing, this God is linked to trade and merchandise, as well as considered\nprotector of thieves.\n\nThe gods gave him the Caduceus, the rod of oblivion. With a clear representation of the\nbalance between two antagonistic forces, recognized for its representation of the eternal\nmovement and in order to be its messenger, it negotiated and guided the souls of the dead to\nthe entrance of Hades. In his role as a psychopomp, he guided people to the other side of\nexistence, reflecting another way of understanding reality. Connected with the world of\ndreams, art, visions that approach madness, whoever did not know his objective function in\nlife, would be guided by him, based on personal discovery.",
