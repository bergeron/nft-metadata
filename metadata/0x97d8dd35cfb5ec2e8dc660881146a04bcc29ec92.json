    "description": "Lit by the moonlight, asleep on the grass lay a zebra cloaked within a highly colourful dress... She is worn and tired out from travelling through the Savannah. She takes a break to rest.\n\nAnother zebra wanders along and stumbles across her, he was startled as it was an unusual place for someone to rest.\n\nThis piece is inspired by the artwork 'The Sleeping Gypsy' by Henri Rousseau\n\nThis is a piece from The Zebra Collection. It is the first mint completed under the $ZEBRA contract!",
