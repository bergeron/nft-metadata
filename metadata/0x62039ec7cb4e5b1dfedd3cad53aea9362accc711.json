    "name": "The 49th Day ",
    "description": "As the twilight nears, the small monks of Kenchosum monastery, Bumthang in central Bhutan gear up for their evening prayers. I was there in the monastery for the 49th day of offering dedicated to my sister in law who we lost to cancer. Buddhists believe that 49 days is the longest length of time the intermediate state of a dead can last. \n\nUntil we lose a dear one, \nWe never accept death as a reality. \n\nWhen the tragedy hits,\nWe shatter in pain, \nWe suffer in agony, \nWe look for a million answers.\n\nNot approving, \nLife is uncertain, \nDeath is certain,\nWe keep questioning. \n\nToday, my heart has accepted that death is a part of life. With every death, there is a rebirth. With every celebration of a new born, there was a mourning of a death. It prepared me well when I again lost my father in less than 5 months gap.  \n\nTo everyone, who reads this, if you are in the same boat, itâ€™s never too late to accept the Truth. \n\nMint  : 1/1 Limited Edition\nPrint & Signed Copy to buyer \n",
