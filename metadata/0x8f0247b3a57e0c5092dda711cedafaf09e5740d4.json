    "description": "NFT #0001 is located in the right middle section of the image with S20 coordinates and represents bottle #0001 of the exclusive Bored Gorilla 01 - Phygital Wine Collection.\r\n \r\n Bored Gorilla connects the world of wine with the digital sphere, as each of the 1000 NFTs \r\n comes with the corresponding magnum bottle of the Bored Gorilla limited edition. In \r\n addition, each bottle in this exclusive collection is protected from unwanted opening by a \r\n physical-digital NFC seal, whose unique identiﬁer is embedded in the NFT itself.\r\n \r\n The gorilla on the label was not drawn by human hands, but by artiﬁcial intelligence - would \r\n you have expected that?",
