    "name": "Fear of Increasing Gravity",
    "description": "I am afraid of leaping a meter from where I am sitting or being buried ten meters below. It can happen in an instant, it can happen under the influence of an extraterrestrial power or magic from the depths of the world. The floor I'm sitting on could fall on me. The wooden chair standing motionless under me could shatter the immobile lamp on the ceiling in seconds. If gravity intends to change direction and want to shake the entire Earth, who can stop it?\n\n  I am drawn towards the core, as if thousands of creatures with strong stone arms are running towards me, wanting to embrace me. The bed I just slept on is already turned upside down, the cloud of dust took off for a second and hung in the air, trapped into a ball of dust and now I can't even sneeze. I lie next to fear, I hug it, I draw my strength from it. I transform into a dementor to destroy it.\n\nFebruary, 2023\nby Demon Ego",
