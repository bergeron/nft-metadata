    "description": "I am an intuitive abstract artist, I painted this art “Fantasia” listening to classical music, during the creation I am guided by the vibration of colors and the energy of the music.\nThis work comes from a research that I started to do in my master's degree, where I investigate how the energy of the songs acts in the vibrational field of the human being.\n\nI use the mabling technique to create my arts, but I use different instruments to create the Nfts arts. I believe that abstract art has its enigmas, mysteries and fascinations. It can awaken in each human being a different feeling, open internal portals to the new, deconstruct everything, experience different sensations to allow each one to experience new emotions through this NFT in itself.",
