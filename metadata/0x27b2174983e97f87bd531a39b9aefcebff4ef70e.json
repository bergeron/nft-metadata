    "name": "Blood sunflowers",
    "description": "In the old field, where people from the village have been growing crops all their lives, a long time ago there was a terrible and brutal murder of a young witch, who, when she was dying, cursed all the people from the village. People did not take her words seriously and the next year they planted beautiful sunflowers in the field. When it was time to collect sunflower seeds, all the people from the village went to the field and blood poured out sharply, soaking the whole earth ... These were cursed bloody flowers that sank into the bodies of local residents with their razor-sharp teeth and tore them apart in a matter of minutes. It is said that this field is still there, and to this day it is planted with bloody sunflowers.",
