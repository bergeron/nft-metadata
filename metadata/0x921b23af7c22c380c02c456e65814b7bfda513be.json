    "description": "SSC 1: Chickenstien\n\nIn some unidentified area of south east Asia, a corporate sold a dream to farmers that could make them a lot of money. A special chicken feed that can turn chicks into full grown chicken in 24 hours. Farmers were skeptical of this experiment and in the end agreed to provide few chickens to the scientists. Farmers saw great progress in the first 1 hour and saw the chicken growing every min. When they returned after 3 hours all the animals at the farm were killed and leaving behind just a trail of foot steps of a human sized monster and those few chickens that were given as experiment were no where to be found.",
