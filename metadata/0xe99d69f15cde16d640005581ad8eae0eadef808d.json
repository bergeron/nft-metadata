    "description": "My name is Dale Forward and I'm an artist. I've been an artist all my life, drawing, making art, doing all the things. I want to create this collection of artworks on ETH to show my hand drawn skills and hopefully make some incredible art to collect and share. This piece is what every future piece is based on. This piece was hand drawn onto paper with a pen and was an intensely physical event because after years of drawing my body has become worn. So for future pieces I'll be drawing them digitally, inspired by this piece.\n\nI draw little people looking at big monsters not only because it's visually appealing but because it can inspire the viewer,  maybe invigorate them. It's how I feel doing this collection for ETH, like I'm going up against a big monster. I am scared to be honest, but from the words of others and confidence in my art, I'm excited to step into the unknown and embrace whatever comes. \n\nThank you to whoever owns this, this piece is very special to me.",
