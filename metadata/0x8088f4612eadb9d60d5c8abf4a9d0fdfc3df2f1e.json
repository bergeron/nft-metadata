The image is a young girl holding a teddy bear and a key. Her third eye has opened, signifying enlightenment.\n\nThe first 888 wallets to mint the contract will have the Vanguard attribute, which differentiates early adopters. The Vanguard attribute will confer priority access to future Sugoi events and drops.",
