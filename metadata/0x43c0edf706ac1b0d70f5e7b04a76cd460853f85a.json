    "description": "Hand painted realistic digital flower painting\n\nWe think we are the focus of every one's life and we take decision according to it but actually that is not the truth. We got one life buddy and we don't want to waste it on what other people will think about us. \n\nI am Heli and I am a self taught digital and watercolor artist. I like painting botanicals and landscapes.\n\nIn this series, I am painting realistic digital flower paintings with an important message with each of them. \n\nI hope you will enjoy my art as much as I enjoy painting them. Thanks for stopping by",
