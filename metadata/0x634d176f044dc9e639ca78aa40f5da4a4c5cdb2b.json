    "description": "#1 was born on December 15, 2083, in Chicica Town, Mars. She was raised by her parents to be a loyal individualist. From a young age, she was determined to grow and learn as much as she could. This led her to develop a strong mind reading ability. However, it also made her a workaholic. She would often spend long hours studying or working, to the detriment of her social life.\n\nDespite her strong work ethic, #1 was always looking for ways to improve herself. This led her to join the International Detective Agency. She saw it as a way to use her skills to help others and make a difference in the world. The agency quickly became her new family, and she was soon one of their most competent investigators.\n\nWhile #1 is usually driven by her desire to help others, she has been known to take on cases for the sheer challenge of it. She loves a good mystery, and will go to great lengths to solve it. This single-mindedness can sometimes put her at odds with her colleagues, but her determination and loyalty always see her through in the end."
