When you walk through town and you can smell the fresh air, you can feel the energy and the history. Itâ€™s like your own little piece of paradise in the midst of the chaos of Europe Rovinj-Rovigno is a sea resort on the Adriatic Sea in Istria (Istra Peninsula), Croatia. Rovinj is an economically important town with a population of 11,894. It is in Croatia, on the isthmus between the islands of Lastovo, Mljet and Ugljan. Home to a large variety of restaurants and bars, Rovinj is an unmissable place for a seaside holiday. Even though they are only two hours away from Zagreb and two hours and 45 minutes from Trieste.
