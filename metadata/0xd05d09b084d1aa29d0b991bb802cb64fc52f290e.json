    "description": "December 29, 2022.\n\nAnniversary of the Fall of Daten Io.\n\nHer name is Daten Io.\n\nShe has a free-spirited personality and does not like boring days.\n\nIn the heavenly realm, there is little stimulation because everything is fulfilled.\n\nIn the heavenly realm, there is no greed, no resentment, no jealousy, no joy, and everyone seems to be a saint.\n\nShe longs for the view of the earth from the heavenly world. Humans are fashionable, jealous, happy, angry, sad, joyful, contentious, and lively every day.\n\nSo she voluntarily decides to fall to the earth.\n\nWhen she fell, she also forced two angels to come with her. Those two resisted badly. They were out of control of IO, so now I carry them around as hair ornaments.\n\nFrom today onward, I will enjoy the earth.",
