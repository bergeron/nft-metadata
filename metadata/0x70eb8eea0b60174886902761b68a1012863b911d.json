    "description": "Inspired by a Documentary about Alexaner Shulgin the Godfather of Psychedelics called Dirty Pictures.  In the documentary Shulgin talked about an experience when he saw the second hand of a clock slow down and he thought if the clock stopped would his consciousness stop as well.  Later he explained that it is possible that if the normal clock stopped when you died that maybe there is another strange clock that someone else sees continues and your consciousness could continue as a result.  This is the clock of your life it has stopped but your consciousness continues. ",
