    "description": "The railway became famous for its route through the Maeklong Railway Market, meaning \"umbrella pulldown market\". It is also a large fresh seafood market in Thailand.\n\n17 trains run daily in each direction on this route. The railway is one of the slowest in Thailand. Moreover, there aren't any signals on the line. When a train approaches, the awnings and shop fronts are moved back from the rails, to be replaced once the train has passed.\n\nYou hear the train long before you actually see it, as the average speed on the track is 30kmph. The vendors and merchants collectively and coolly begin to move their belongings and umbrellas away from the tracks as the train barrels forward, honking on its horn every now and then to warn people of its approach. This is why the market is known as “umbrella pulldown market”.\n\nWhen I heard that honk and saw people moving sideways in order to make the train pass by, I placed myself on an appropriate point to see how it comes and shot this photo.",
