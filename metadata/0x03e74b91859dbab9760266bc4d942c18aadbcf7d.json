    "description": "This collection is a tribute to the most minimal and fundamental symbol: the dot.\n\nA dot is a matter of art and a symbol of exploration. Creating the perfect dot at the right place of the paper.\nFor a musician, putting dots is creating music, notes, melodies. The goal is again putting the dot at the right position. \nFollowing Pythagoras, the dot is the beginning of eternity. Carl Jung \nThe dot also symbolizes the world in which we live, the place to rest, away from the chaotic world.  It stands for our navel the center our emotional world. Look to our soul, heart and bodyâ€¦ \n",
