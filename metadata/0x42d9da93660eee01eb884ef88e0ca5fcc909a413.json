    "name": "Under Cover of Darkness",
    "description": "The utter darkness consumes your vision for a few moments, but then a foggy haze and floating dim lights begin to lead you through the void. Maybe your eyes have just adjusted to the pitch black, or a passing cloud let some moonlight slip through, but suddenly a place emerges from the shadows. A city street full of lights and people. The sudden chaos here is hard to grasp.\nDo you remember how you got here? Are you here of your own choice or were you lured into the night by an unseen force?\nThis place is totally unfamiliar, like you've just wound up in some strange foreign city. The moon is the same, but under it is just an illusion of normal life, occupied by menacing and otherworldly figures.  Your gut tells you this uncanny place is detached from everything you know. Is it the afterlife? You're still breathing, but your lungs don't want to breathe the air. \nYour senses begin to return, you just remembered why you came here, and why you come here every night.\n\n4000 x 4000\nBLAKKMASS",
