    "description": "The afterlife of a tree is a mysterious and wonderful thing. When a tree dies, its essence does not disappear. Just as a tree grows and changes during its lifetime, so too does its spirit continue to grow and change after death. A tree's spirit can take on many different forms. It might choose to stay close to the Earth and help new trees to grow. Or it might choose to journey to the stars and help to light the way for others.\n\n\nJPEG image \n6000 x 6000 pixels  \nHeelmonster | 2023",
