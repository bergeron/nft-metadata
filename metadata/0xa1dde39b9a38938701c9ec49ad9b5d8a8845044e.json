    "description": "STUDIO DEL PRESENTE is a continuing of an ongoing investigation into the ever-changing. It is part of a three year research which has brought to the creation of four installations/exhibitions. The blocks are part of STUDIO DEL PRESENTE: ATTO PRIMO, the first act of the second and latest phase.\n\nDisruption has happened. The cracks are there.\nWhat is next to come? How will mankind consciously adjust and eventually adapt to the disrupted existence of today?\n\nThe blocks are a reflection of the now and how those “cracks”, which we are co-living with are going to condition us. Everything man-made has an expiration date, as does man itself. Humans and their inventions are represented by the blocks, which will be erased and will take their original form as raw material.\n\nThrough the installation, I seek to enhance the relation and parallels between the artificial and natural. \n\nEverything we touch alters or disappears.",
