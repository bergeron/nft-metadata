Saint Jordi is the patron saint of Catalonia and is celebrated April 23. A beautiful tradition that dates back to the Middle Ages.\n\nA real paving tile must be left to dry for weeks to ensure the longevity of the piece. In web3 this PANOT had to rest thanks to the chaos generated from $pepe, the memecoin season and my budget üòÖ\n\nü¶∂ Panot lives on the floor of your Metaverse to remind you the importance of keeping your feet on the ground, of growing step by step. Always respecting and helping others.üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èWALK-INüö∂  \n",
