    "description": "Nomad Saliha was walking with her baby Mehmet at her back in front. Her elder children came on horseback just behind her. The expression on her face is reflection of life on Middle Asia steppes. I took this photography 20 years ago. It is one of the symbols of Nomads women and of the migration for me.",
