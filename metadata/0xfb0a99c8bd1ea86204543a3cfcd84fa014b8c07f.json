    "description": "These are Lil EGG Monsters digital collectables minted on my own ERC721A smart contract using niftykit-dropkit on the ethereum blockchain\n\nThey have a story some is explained on the tokens, some I leave up to your imagination but this is HALLOWEEN and anything is possible. Please enjoy the one you save, it will follow you forever each October.\n\nI hope you like my creations, the base images were created with GAN and I hand embellished each one with color, scenes and words to further their mystery. Please review more of my art here: https://linktr.ee/karrieross on Twitter\n\n------------- \nRoss's distinctive, metaphorical, whimsical narrative, thought-provoking, abstract pieces revolve around the central theme of energy. She believes that the potential to create one's own energy has the power to alter a person's experiences & life circumstances.
