    "description": "Billions of years ago, everything in the universe was contained in a tiny ball that exploded!\n\nThe Big Bang theory says that the universe came into being from a single, unimaginably hot and dense point, also known as a singularity, more than 13 billion years ago. \nThe theory says that the space did not exist before this event, rather it initiated the expansion of space itself.  \nBut what if that theory were nothing more than the impossibility of seeing beyond the observable universe, of not being able to see what is hidden behind the darkness?  \nAnd what if the universe, as we know it, were no longer a small part of a great cosmos? \n\nThe borders of our universe could be nothing more than the beginning of something that is beyond human reason and only the imagination can understand.  \nLike the hazelnut in the filling of a chocolate, like an embryo inside an egg.\n\nThis is my genesis: The birth of our Universe and this series of art.\n\nThis is my vision. Now, close your eyes. How do you imagine it?  \n",
