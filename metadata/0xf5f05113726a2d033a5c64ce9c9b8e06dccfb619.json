    "description": "“Loneliness is harder than covid”\nHer name is Hatice. He lives alone in a town. Her husband passed away years ago. Their children, on the other hand, migrated from the town to the big cities for better opportunities. After all these, the event that hurt the old woman the most was the pandemic conditions. Because she doesn't see her neighbors. All he does is look at old photos and live in memories.\nI went to photograph Hatice's loneliness. I listened to her for a while. The sentence that hurt me the most. \"Living alone is harder than living with COVID\"\n\nFeatures of NFT picture:\nLocation:Trabzon/Turkey\nShooting date 13.06.2021\nResolution: 300dpi\nDimension: 7309x4873\nSize: 18.3mb\nprint:1/1\nf.5 1/40sn iso-500\nNİKON D800 Lens: 24 70mm2.8\nNftartist Engin Ayyıldız",
