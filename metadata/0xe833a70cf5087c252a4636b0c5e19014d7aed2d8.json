    "description": "April 14th, 2022 marked a historic moment in naval history when the Moskva warship, one of the largest and most advanced vessels in the Russian Navy, was dramatically sunk. The vessel, known for its previous attack on Snake Island, met its fate at the hands of a coalition of Ukrainian and allied forces.\n\nThe sinking of the Moskva was a significant event that serves as a reminder of the power and unpredictability of the sea, and the bravery of those who carried out the attack. As the largest Russian warship sunk since WWII, its destruction had a tremendous psychological impact and marked a turning point in the conflict.",
