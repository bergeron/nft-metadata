    "description": "Many today suffer from sustained trauma to the delicate micro-networks that permeate a small area just under the belly button. As well as affecting our ability to be emotionally intimate with others, trauma to these networks will often affect our creativity. \n\nFortunately, Peithos have a remarkable ability to heal and restore the flow of life-force in this sensitive region  Along with increased desire to participate in a community, contact with the Peithos will often unleash creative impulses that manifest as real-world solutions to stubborn problems.\n",
