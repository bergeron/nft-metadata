    "description": "You know, there is such type of people, meeting whose radically changes your life. It is a great fortune to meet such a person. Everything looks different when they are around and you are beginning to believe in what you have never even thought about before. It is a breath of life and incredible insights. \n\nIt is another, exalted value, relationships and gratitude. It is a lofty love which is not like anything else. And I experienced it. \n\nWe just once met in the gym and he offered me to go home on foot together and not by bus. “Only on foot” - it became our motto 3 years later when we spent 3 weeks conquering Crimean mountains and living in a tent. We brushed our teeth in the sea, used a gas burner for making food and read books at the very edge of the mountains watching the sea in front of us, the stars above us and the towns below us. \n\nHe said that I would always remember this trip and he didn’t lie.
