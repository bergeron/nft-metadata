    "description": "It's extremely sad what is currently happening in Ukraine. People were living their normal lives few weeks ago and now they have to face the terror of war and fight for their freedom. Piece is created to commemorate the heroism of Ukrainian people.\n\nWe are against war and believe only in piece and love between all the nations. We think that those in power who drag nations into wars are psychopaths who should be stopped.\n\nProceeds from this piece will be used to help people affected the most by the crisis. Some of them are our family and friends.\n\nBittersweet pieces",
