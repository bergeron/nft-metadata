Digital drawing and 2D animation\n\nComposition in blue-pink tones around the theme of the chimera, meanders of wood, foliage and flowers\n\nUnique work, 6 variations.\nCourtesy galerie Loevenbruck, Paris\n\n\n\nPhilippe Mayaux (France, 1961) describes himself as a “fourth generation surrealist.” His oeuvre is a singular and category-defying mix underpinned by a mosaic of historical and contemporary references. \n\nMayaux has made figurative paintings since the early 1990s. His carefully fashioned pictures teem with hallucinatory scenes. Fragments of sexualized bodies, monstrous hybrid creatures, cakes and vanitases enliven his canvases, drawings and sculptures, constituting a protean and disturbing body of work.\n\nChimera is a collection of 6 unique digital drawings and 2D animations, with a composition in various tones around the theme of the chimera, meanders of wood, foliage and flowers. \nAfter Chimère libérée, 2017, design for a tapestry, Mobilier national Collection, France.\n",
