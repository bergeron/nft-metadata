    "description": "Heady Freddie was made out of trash and had a very bad attitude. He was always picking fights with the other dolls and getting them into trouble. One day, Freddie got into a fight with a doll named Barbie. Barbie was a very popular doll and she always looked perfect. Freddie was jealous of her and he wanted to take her down. He hit her with a stick and she fell to the ground. Barbie's friends came to her rescue and they beat up Freddie. Freddie was so angry that he vowed to get revenge on Barbie. He waited for her to be alone and then he pushed her into the dumpster. Barbie was so scared that she never came out again. Freddie laughed and went back to picking fights with the other dolls.",
