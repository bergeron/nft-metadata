    "description": "1/1 by Athena Novo, B-Sides, 2022\n\nB-Sides Athena is a chance carefully worked on. A natural outcome of AI artwork is orchestrating through images to develop the desired one that tells the story, makes the point and marks the style. In doing so a much bigger set of images are ignored, unused and destroyed. B-Sides is some of those images purposefully curated. It is like a band releasing the song list that never made the album and yet had a keen following during the concert or the club gig. The artwork will be minted on its own Manifold deployed smart contract B-Sides and on various art platforms.",
