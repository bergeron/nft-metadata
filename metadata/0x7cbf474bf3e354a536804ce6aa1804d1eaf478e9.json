    "description": "A beachfront on a world far from here. A surf shack, straw parasol, a high promenade in the distance. Countless stories happen here over the course of a year. \n\nA unique time-dependent animated pixel art piece. \n\nThis spring edition depicts a crisp bright day. Just warm enough for some fishing, if your tracking system can locate a fish. At night, it moves into a darker scene. Getting ready to close up the shack for the night after a day out.",
