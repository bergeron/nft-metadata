    "description": "After the success of 'Glitch' I've decided that in 2023 I will be releasing 8 music/art NFT’s as open editions at 0.069 E each. \n\nThe first 3 explore how technology impacts us as a society.\n\nThe next tracks..are a surprise ;)\n\nHolders of 8 editions (either unique or multiples of one piece) will receive a vinyl with all 8 tracks on it, plus a special airdropped art piece of the album cover. \n\nHolders of 6/7 editions will receive the airdropped album cover art.\n\nHolders of 4/5 editions will be eligible for a 50% discount on album cover art. \n\nHolders of 3 editions will be eligible for a 25% discount on album cover art.\n\nIf you already purchased ‘Glitch’ on nifty gateway you can include this as one of your editions! \n\nI really am excited about this body of work, I hope you enjoy it and find observations of yourself and the world around us through it. \n\n\n\nArt/lyrics/performance by Stefanie Neal \nMusic production by David Skeet \n\n‘Tunnel Vision’ is part of a series that explores the implications our technology driven world has on us.\n\nThis piece was inspired by my own experiences, that of many other women I know and after watching ‘The Social Dilemma’ - I was shocked and saddened to hear the tripling of self harm among pre-teen girls and a 150% rise in suicides since the rise of social media apps.\n\nThe works aim is to observe these issues, paying attention to what we pay attention to, often rewards us with the answers..\n\nArtist reserves full copyright ownership for both art and music.  \nMusic cannot be extracted, altered and/or resold in any way aside from on the blockchain as the full NFT art piece.",
