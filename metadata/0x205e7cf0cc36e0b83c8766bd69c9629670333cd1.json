    "description": "Picture date: 25th December 2077  \nA cyber-infused Monk who goes by the pseudonym M0NX has finally achieved complete control over his brain using multi-receptors and a prosthetic brain which allows the human brain to function over 200% more efficiently. With a reactor on his chest which makes the heart immortal. By communicating with the receptors infused inside his brain, M0NX can achieve whatever he manifests.  \nHis primary source of energy is light through which he can stay alive for at least 2 years without being dependent on food and water.  \nM0NX seeks shelter in a luminous forest that normal human beings canâ€™t find.",
