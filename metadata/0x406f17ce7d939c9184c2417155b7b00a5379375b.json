    "description": "The Po Leung Kuk Main Building was built in 1932 and was rated as a Grade II historic building by the government in 2009. It is the most historic part of the building complex of the Headquarters. As this year marks the 90th anniversary of the Po Leung Kuk Main Building, we took this as a design inspiration to create a series of NFTs, combining charity, history and technology to let the public know more about Po Leung Kukâ€™s services.",
