    "description": "Moments fade away, memories last forever.\n\nA dance is ephemeral and happens in the moment, a fraction of time that instantly vanishes forever in the past.\nLive dance performance creates fleeting emotions that only the video medium can encapsulate in a persistent memory. Without however fully capturing the impermanence immanent to the beauty of dance.\n\nCan a sculpture - a digital & tangible expression of space & time - resulting from a live dance movements captures these emotions ?",
