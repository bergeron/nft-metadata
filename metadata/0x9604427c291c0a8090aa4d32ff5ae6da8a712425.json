    "description": "As the heavy clouds glide ominously over the landscape, a sense of unease washes over the people below. Is this the beginning of a fierce storm? Or merely a passing shower? Only time will reveal the answer. The clouds gradually transform into wispy tendrils that stand out in sharp contrast against the angularity of the cityscape below.\n\nThis piece isn't about realism, but rather the emotional experience of impending storms. It captures the sensations that the weather creates within us. We feel small and insignificant in the face of its immense power. Time seems to slow down, as we become more attuned to our surroundings. Our senses are electrified by the impending lightning strikes. The painting captures the raw intensity of the moment.",
