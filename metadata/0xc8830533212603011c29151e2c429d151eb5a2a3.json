    "description": "In Pre-colonial Africa, One of his most sacred creations was the sculpted head rest. In daily life, it protected the vulnerable ceremonial hairstyle, but its symbolic meaning went far beyond that. It reflected the owner's well-being and social prestige, and it protected him against nightmares. The head rest was such an important personal possession that it was often buried with its deceased owner.",
