    "description": "With my art I like the viewer to be able to create their own story from what they see, I think it creates a unique experience. So when you see my meaning I don't want it to take away what you see first as the story.\n\nThe story I saw when creating, was a story of dependency on the close circle around you, people you grew up with, and the need in the back of your head to want to dissapear, create  anew name, move and just erase yourself.  \n\nThis piece is something extremely special to me. Creating this took aboiut a week but I believe its the culmination of my last few months of work. To be clear this is not my peak but a start of something amazing to come.",
