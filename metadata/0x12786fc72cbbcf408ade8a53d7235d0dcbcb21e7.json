    "description": "Liquid Mirror  \nProcedurally manipulated MiniDV camera footage  \n2009\n\nMinted on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke, an exhibition honoring a pioneer of computer art. \n\nLiquid Mirror is part of an early body work dealing with the procedural manipulation of video footage recorded from the natural and human made environment. In Liquid Mirror, I recorded myself holding and bending a textured acrylic mirror. The source footage is an abstract series of reflections, shadows, and bending light. Through the usage of Max, a programming language for multimedia, I adjusted the footage to be rotationally symmetric, and manipulated the temporal rhythm based on the video data itself. The result is a meditative and mandala like form that evolves over time in emergent ways.\n\nI chose to include this artwork in the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke as it relates to the vast series of generative and procedural photography he produced in the 1950's and 60's. Liquid Mirror is an artwork in the same spirit, using the natural world as a starting point to reveal emergent forms and structures through procedural techniques. \n\n100% of the proceeds from primary sales will be donated to the art meets science â€“ Foundation Herbert W. Franke, supporting the preservation and legacy of his artwork.\n\nhttps://www.tribute-hwf.com/ \nhttps://art-meets-science.io/",
