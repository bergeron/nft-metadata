    "description": "Hi everyone! Thank you for coming over and listening to my song \"There's not a moment where I'm not alone.\" I wrote this song in my tiny studio apartment overlooking the very grey Lake Erie. Winter blues is nothing new around here, but it does get better once the sun creeps out of from the clouds. Hoping you all are keeping your chin up! <3",
