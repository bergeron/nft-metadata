    "description": "This past weekend..\nI indulged in a bunch of activities I used to enjoy in my youth, getting reacquainted with the inner-child. Playing old video games (GBA, Sega, PSP etc.)/Solo trip to an arcade, Having an Italian icee, going to Universal Studios in LA for the first time (Only been to Disney World).\n\nThink these periods are very necessary, after all that, Sunday afternoon-- I just opened logic, connected my MPC-X, my keyboard and just started exploring. \n\nHere is an electronic piece with absolutely no structure, just a journey in curiosity. To be honest, I'm just happy to still be connected to whatever allows me to do this.. \n\nIf anyone would like to give this a spin or approach, let me know.\n\nAs usual,\nEnjoy!",
