    "description": "'Twas the morning of Christmas, and all through the house, The society in mayhem, in enormous amounts; The presents ripped apart, without a care, Gift wraps and ribbons, scattered everywhere.  The Apes were bouncing around, some on their heads, Some were on the couch, the usual potheads; Spencer looking shocked, in his red Santa’s cap, He grits his teeth, he’s about to snap.  Then out reached a hand, it patted his shoulder, He turned and saw LOCO, asking what is the matter; Spencer said his mind’s in a daze, his memories are a flash, LOCO sat down beside him and threw up the sash.  He said ‘Look inside, I got something for you’, Spencer took a peek, he saw something cool; It was a HUGE ass blunt, freshly rolled and brand new, He’s too stun for words, just ‘Oooooooo…’  ‘Its been a wild ride my friend, we’re only getting started’, Spencer looked at LOCO, and his head nodded; He lit the blunt in his hand, and took a long hit, MERRY CHRISTMAS MUHFUKKAS! LETS GO APE SHIT!",
