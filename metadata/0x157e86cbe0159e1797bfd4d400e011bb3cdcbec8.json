    "description": "Like most things in life, there are two sides to nature. While it can be nurturing and beautiful, it can also be destructive and calamitous.\n\nMy painting hopes to bring attention to #SaveSoil movement. Organic-healthy soil allows all kinds of life to grow, as well as have a positive impact on our mental, emotional and physical wellbeing.\n\nWhen/if we do not ensure our soil is healthy is will destroy the very life we depend on.",
