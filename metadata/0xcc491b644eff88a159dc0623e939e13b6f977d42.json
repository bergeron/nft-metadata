    "description": "1/1 \n\n\"The Watcher\" was taken in heart of New York City in 2018. As a street photographer, I love watching people. The more you sit back and watch the world unfold before you, you notice the people who tend to blend in. This gentleman is in his news stand all day, everyday. I'm sure he has stories for days. To capture and celebrate those people and those moments that we take for granted is what I hope to continue to do with my work. \n\nThe primary owner from this NFT auction will also receive a physical print. \n\nüì∏ Sony A7III \nüìç Manhattan, New York",
