A sincere thank you! \n\nInspired by classical realistic paintings and Christian mythology. Older depictions of angels as more unsettling and powerful celestial beings, in particular. \nAn AI output was used to generate the initial idea, which was composited and overpainted in Photoshop to produce the final digital painting. \n\nCreated by Dariusz Kieliszek.",
