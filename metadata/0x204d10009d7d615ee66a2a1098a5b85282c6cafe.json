    "description": "The ephemeral art project TO BEE OR NOT TO BE is intended to raise awareness of the importance of bees and their plight. The art painting represents an abstract macro shot of a bee wing to portray its complex tiny organism which is essential for our ecosystem.\n\nThe philosophy behind my art is the essence of impermanence. The concept of transience reflects the time we live in as a multifaceted reality where the artwork and we are part of the natural world. It leaves no legacy except for a photograph and memories, as a reflection of living the natural cycle of life on earth and how eventually, even the most indelible mark fades to nothing in the end.\n\nItâ€˜s also about treading lightly on the earth as an environmental measure, leaving only a gentle footprint on a delicate planet. Photographed and then left to the elements to decay and leave nothing permanent behind as a portrayal of birth, life, and death. In the present era, it is all about contributing a verse, what will your verse be?",
