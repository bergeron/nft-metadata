    "description": "\"Holy cow!\", an exclamation of surprise used mostly in the west. It is a minced oath or euphemism to express surprise or excitement.\n\nThe expression dates to at latest 1905. Who knew?!\n\nThis painting is a literal presentation of the expression! Specifically chosen because of the holiness of Cows from my culture and the fun twist from the west! ",
