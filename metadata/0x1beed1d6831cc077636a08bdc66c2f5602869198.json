    "description": "The House of Tengu - KHA05\n\nKHA05 had risen through the tiers of the House of Tengu for both his ruthlessness and his meticulous nature. The House of Tengu was feared and respected because of how its members operated and what they accomplished. It wasn’t just those in the Vents who crossed the street when they saw an H.o.T tag on the side of a building. Even the 0N1 elites, despite having more protection than the Emperor himself, shivered at the thought of running into the MasQ Raiders. That reputation hadn’t always existed for the House. In fact, for years before KHA05 took the title of Boss, the House was known for its pranks and devilish ploys. While the House of Tengu was known for mischief, it had never been known for mayhem, or mastery of anything, really.",
