    "description": "Built this set in my studio in 2019 for part of my \"Shadows\" photographic series (one of my favorite series to date). There was a lot of full-body black suits and black sheets involved in this photo haha (and staple-gunning the material to the walls/floor). The dirt left over from another shoot was perfect and I ended up keeping it in the center.",
