    "description": "Ever since I started my photography journey, one image that I have seen time and time again from other artists is the lonesome remains of the DC Plane wreck in SÃ³lheimasandur, Iceland. Finally, I decided to pack up my camera bag and go and see this wonder for myself.\n\nThe eerie wreckage sits lifelessly alone on the volcanic sands, underneath the glistening wonder that is the Aurora, as if the lost crew still haunt the barren wasteland.
