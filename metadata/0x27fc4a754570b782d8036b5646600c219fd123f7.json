    "description": "we’re a lisbon born, london based alt-electronic duo. \n\nin 2020 we found ourselves unable to tour for the first time since we started playing together and we began taking interest in web 3 and all the possibilities it could lead to within the music industry. \n\nin the beginning of this year we were selected as one of five artists to be part of the LNRZ freshman class and work on music nfts alongside Reo Cragun, clear eyes, and the rest of the freshmen (Madalen Duke, Tate Tucker, Lackhoney and Mark Jonhs).\n\nafter doing a couple of releases with LNRZ we're happy to be releasing our first sound drop on our own.\n\n\"the balance i crave” is a mourning song about the loss of a special connection you once had with someone you grew up with.
