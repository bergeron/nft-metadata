    "description": "This Pepe doesn't care about anything.  She/He keeps going to clubs and parties because it's cool.  Why change your habits if they are habitual.  We may not notice that it is tired or does not make sense.  But it's unlikely we'll change anything, right?  We are used to it.  It distracts from work that we cannot change.  We can't change anything but the brand of milk in our fridge.  And even that is difficult.  They pour the same milk in packs.",
