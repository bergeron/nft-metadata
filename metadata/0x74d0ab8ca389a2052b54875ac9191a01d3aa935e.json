    "description": "We often remember those places we were taken to as children, where we were happy, were we discovered new landscapes, wildlife, life lessons. My dad used to take me to this hill to play and show me the nearby docks when I was a kid. This is where the Panama Canal Administration building sits. Here I also took some of my first pics on professional film when I was in college, some 30-odd years ago. I always like to come back to these places and see the cycle of life repeating. \n\nThis collection is about those places in Panama, a country tied to its two oceans, only a few miles apart from each other. \n\nJPEG 2120 × 2651\n300 dpi",
