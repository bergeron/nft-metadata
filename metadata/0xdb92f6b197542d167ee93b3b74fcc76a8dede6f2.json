    "description": "Getting out to the Ice Shacks can often be a challenge, especially when the snow is deep. Lucky for me, there are usually snowmobile tracks criss-crossing all over the place, and they make a perfect track for me to ski on. \nIt often feels like I can jump on a track like this and go on forever, as they head off far into the void. \nIf you look closely at this image you'll see a couple Ice Shacks in the distance, and a snowmobile parked next to one of them.",
