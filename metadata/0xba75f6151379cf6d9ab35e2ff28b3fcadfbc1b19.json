    "description": "She’s on fire\nLooks like a girl, but she's a flame\nSo bright, she can burn your eyes\nBetter look the other way\nYou can try, but you'll never forget her name\nShe's on top of the world\nHottest of the hottest girls \nThis girl is on fire\nShe's walking on fire\nEverybody stares as she goes by\n'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes\nWatch her as she's lighting up the night\nThis girl is on fire \nShe’s just a girl, but she’s on fire\n\nSongwriter: Alicia Keys",
