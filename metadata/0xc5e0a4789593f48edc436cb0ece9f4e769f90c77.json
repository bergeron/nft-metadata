    "description": "Driving around a city like NYC with friends during a snowstorm is an experience like nothing else. This night was one of those moments where we all felt like kids doing whatever we wanted. With the streets being empty if felt like we had the city to ourselves. This photo is a special one to me. As I turned around from making a photo I saw my buddy Louie getting up on a wall in the midst of the snow fall. I reacted quickly to make a couple of frames of him in action. This was and remains one of my favorite pictures from this night, especially with losing Louie to suicide a few years later. A photo can demonstrate a a captured moment in time. The ability to transport us right back to then and the ability to relive it. This picture does that for me and still remains one of my favorite moments to have photographed to this day. ",
