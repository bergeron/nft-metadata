    "description": "I told you it was the first time I had ever gone \n100 mph on a highway \nit was empty \nin Valentine \nI was shocked at how slow it felt \nI liked cruising at 80 \n\nI wondered why I never let myself write prose \nor do the things I want to \n\nWhen we got back we covered our bed with \na tarp & as the storm began & you were fixing \nthe door to the tent a dog ran inside & came right to me \nchild of Hecate \nhis owners called him Bandit \nhe was shaking \nso we let him sit out the weather with us \nwe ate gas station chips \nI drink pop on vacation \nbecause I don’t drink \nthat night we saw the lights \nI wish I knew how to describe them to you \nas anything other than alien \nor celestial, mining the land \nfar far out west \nor were they waltzing \n1 would appear then 3       \nthen 6 then none then 1 \n& all the locals said we hadn’t\neven seen shit \nI thought about how I read\nthat James Dean became so fascinated \nwith them that he demanded a telescope for his trailer on set \n\n& how he probably wrote prose \n",
