    "description": "We wrote this song as way to deal with a real life situation with an external consequence. Sstrawberry uses these metaphors and lyrics as a way to navigate his fate and find hope in a personal situation. We are both navigating faith. Not only in our selves, but one another, and beyond. We wrote this song in the depths of a hard situation as a way to deal with the pain of the current systems in power. We wrote this with hopes that you can find faith in yourself, your fellows and beyond.",
