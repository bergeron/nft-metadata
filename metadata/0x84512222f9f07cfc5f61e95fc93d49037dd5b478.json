We discuss the potential for monetization and engagement through these mechanisms, the challenges that creators face, and how Web3 can help solve them. We also explore the overlap between personal and professional experience as a Web3 user working at Bankless, and how the Bankless media strategy aligns with Defi community values. Finally, we offer tips for creators using NFTs to turn viewers into collectors and consider what to expect for the evolution of podcast NFTs in the coming years.",
