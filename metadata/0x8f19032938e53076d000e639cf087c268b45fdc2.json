    "description": "Exploration of the ongoing debate surrounding the integration of Artificial Intelligence in the art world. This collection depicts the Anti-AI movement visualized as old men (the old way of thinking) locked in battle with the pro-AI art movement represented as The Vandals. These pieces illustrate the noise associated with the complex and nuanced nature of the debate.   However, ultimately, The Vandals, are victorious, suggesting that the benefits of incorporating AI into art and culture will ultimately outweigh the concerns.\n\nAI-Collaborative Digital Sketch",
