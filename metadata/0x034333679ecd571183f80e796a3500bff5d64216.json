    "name": "FOREST AT DAWN",
    "description": "FOREST AT DAWN represents the first piece in The Elements collection. In this collection I wanted to take a step back from the landforms themselves and instead consider the elements responsible for shaping our environment. \n\nThe environmental focus for this piece was humidity. Humidity affects human beings, animals, and plants. In a given environment, humidity is one of the determining factors for which particular flora and fauna can thrive. As such humidity undoubtedly has a significant impact on our environment.\n\nOriginally produce on a 24x24 canvas.",
