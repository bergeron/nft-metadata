    "description": "Neptune's Wrath is about the sheer power of the oceans; it isn't hard to imagine why ancient people worshiped the sea or thought it was the domain of a god. \nThe sublime nature of the oceans cradles us all, life giving but also chaotic and wild. \nDepicted here with the use of AI is the battering of land and rock from wave after wave, the force sculpting the coastline, the line is drawn where our lives intercept with a different realm.
