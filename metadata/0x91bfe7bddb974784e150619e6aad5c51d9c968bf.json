    "description": "my strings were too vulnerable to stand the weather in every city. But my long neck made everything flexible for me. I absorbed the faces, the colors, the stares, and the spaces in each city and gave them sounds. sounds of loneliness, helplessness, failures, attempts, hope, and love. I was a curious setar that witnessed many stories from place to place, even though nobody realized my presence. you can call me a wanderer now.\n\nanimation: mysterivision",
