    "description": "Artist: Shinsei Galverse Ã— Sneakerwolf\n\nThe kumade is a talisman that wishes for prosperity in business, safety in the home, and other good fortune.\nWhy is the kumade considered a good luck charm? Representing an old farm tool used to rake up fallen leaves and other debris, the kumade has come to be associated with the meaning of \"stirring up luck\" or \"stirring up money\".\n\nThis is a project where you can purchase both a REAL KUMADE and a NFT KUMADE.\nThe Galverse NFT KUMADE is customizable at mint. Choose between 6 Gal characters to place in any of the 4 kumade slots, which can then be minted as an original 3D NFT.\n\nThe copyright belongs to the artist.  \nCommercial use is prohibited.\nSecondary sales commission (artist): 5% of sales price\nSecondary sales commission (XYZA): 2.5% of sales price",
