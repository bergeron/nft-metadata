    "description": "#### MAGMA COLUMN\nCity-sized gigantic structures harvesting the heat of awaken volcanos to refine raw mechanium ore and store it in its purest form. The most advanced technologies are put to use in magma columns in order to operate in such an hostile and extreme environment. Only the leading elite can have the ownership of what is among humanityâ€™s wildest challenge and achievement.\n\n#### MARS\nHome to the first space colony of mankind, Mars has been successively the last bastion of civilisation during the Dark Age and the cradle of its rebirth when the Mechanium ore was first discovered on its surface in 2204. It is now both a merciless Mecha battlefield and the host to the most technologically advanced cities and factories.",
