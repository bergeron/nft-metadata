    "description": "The shooting character reflects the burden of stereotypical national attributes that are assigned to a person because of his appearance and country of birth.\n\nUnfortunately in modern world people still let themselves judge others basing only on knowledge where this person was born. Entrenched outdated stereotypes based on race and nationality slow down the formation of a unified world community and the development of humanity. it also generates unjustified aggression and neglect of people born in a particular country with a particular set of appearance traits.
