    "description": "Tectonic plates may shift and shake  \nDinosaurs may roam and quake  \nBut through it all, the sky remains  \nA canvas painted in vibrant strains\n\nMagic fills the air, a guiding light  \nAdventure waits to take flight  \nLove, the greatest force of all  \nWill catch us when we stumble and fall\n\nFor every storm that rages on  \nA rainbow will appear, a beacon strong  \nAnd as the sunlight warms our hearts  \nWe'll find the strength to make a new start\n\nSo hold on tight, dear friend of mine  \nEverything will be okay in time  \nFor no matter what the future holds  \nWe'll brave the journey, brave and bold",
