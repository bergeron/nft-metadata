    "description": "'Upstream'  \nRiver Itchen, Hampshire, England\n\nArtist - Michael Hartley\n\nA winter's day by the beautiful River Itchen in Hampshire. An evergreen ivy has reached down from a dormant tree, meeting the cold, slow-flowing water.\n\nIt is one of only 200 chalk streams in the world, and a site of special scientific interest. There's a chance to spot kingfishers, otters, trout, Atlantic salmon, and white-clawed crayfish.\n\n\nMichael Hartley - A photo artist living on the South Coast of England. A passion for exploring coastlines, and ancient forests, creating in response to nature. Processing in black and white, often in a minimalist, spacious style (2022)\n\nDate Taken - 24th February 2017 - 13:39  \nLocation - 51.001646, -1.326528  \nEdition - 1/1  \nCamera - Nikon D5500  \nLens - Sigma 17-50mm  \nCapture Settings - 29mm, 1/50 of a second at f/8 and ISO 100, hand held\n\nLicense - Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
