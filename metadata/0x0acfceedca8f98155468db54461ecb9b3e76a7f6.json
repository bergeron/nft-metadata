    "description": "In the early hours of the morning is where youâ€™ll find Rob down the beach, usually surfing a left peak by himself. When the conditions align Todd brings the camera out and captures those moments. In very few other sports will a photographer get to be as close to the action as they will in surfing. The combination of swell, tide, light, location and teamwork helps make these creative visions come to life. Todd's camera was inches away from Rob's head on this one. This NFT comes with a 18\"x24\" signed print, for the original NFT owner only. ",
