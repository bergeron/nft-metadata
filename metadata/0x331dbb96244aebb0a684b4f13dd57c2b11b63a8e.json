    "description": "The evolution of art has always been about pushing boundaries and exploring new mediums and techniques. I created and titled this piece “Surface” because that is what most people see when they look at all art mediums.\n\nWith AI art that is especially prevalent. Assuming that no vision, concept, or creative process was put to practice and with a simple click of a button, you can create a piece of art.\n\nI created “Surface” to prove that this is a misconception and could not be further from the truth.\n\nWithout a clear vision, an AI piece could not be more devoid of purpose and meaning. Therefore, by arousing such discontent in some people’s hearts, it proves to be an art form with soul imbued. \n\nWhose soul? Both the creator’s and the viewer.",
