    "description": "We don't see things as they are. We see them as we are. We are Vibrations, Emanations and Reverberations. Noetic 213 is from a series of artworks that tune a visual harmonic to make music for our eyes. The first collector of this NFT will also receive a signed 34 in. Hi res. inkjet studio proof, 2800 dpi inkjet on paper, to hang on their wall.\n\nNoetic is a name up term (not by me), to imply automatic knowledge just by looking at something, like a supercharged intuition mixed with spiritual conviction.  Maybe, but vibrations, emanations and reverberations contain the essence of all things, don't they?",
