    "name": "Queen of Revenge",
    "description": "\"Queen of Revenge\"\n\nPride can be clearly seen in the face of this queen. \nYou can easily see the revenge in her eyes because blood has collected in her eyes and she is thinking of taking revenge on her enemies. \nYou can still see the success in her eyes because her eyes sparkle and this sparkle is because of killing her enemies who have prevented her success. She is happy by killing her enemies and hopes to win.\nIf you look at the crown on this queen's head, you will notice that there are thorns all around it, which are the hardships she endured to reach the position of queen. \nThe enemies of this queen had harassed and harmed her so much in the past that all these injuries have turned into a complex and this queen intends to get rid of the complex of many years by taking revenge.\n\nMy idea for making this character was one of the characters of the \"Mortal Kombat\" game and I was also inspired by the \"Nabu Faces\" project by \"Bavugar Nabu\".",
