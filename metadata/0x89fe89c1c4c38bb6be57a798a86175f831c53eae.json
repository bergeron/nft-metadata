    "description": "It’s been a while that I have started to interview international musicians as an independent journalist from Iran, which most of them are activists of Rock and Metal genre. A genre which faces limitations in Iran.\nIn this part of my interview with Klaus Meine the singer of the Scorpions, he speaks about the creation of the song “wind of change”, an idea which came to his mind during his presence in the legendary Moscow music peace festival. The time when fans from all over the soviet union gathered around and the soldiers of the red army threw their hats and jackets up in the sky and joined with the crowd. He also quoted a very touching sentence: “our parent’s generations came with tanks and we came with guitars.” Klaus Meine said: at that moment right before our eyes the world changed once again and this interview could be a flip so that this time we witness the change and peace before our eyes in today’s world.",
