    "description": "Thunderstorm skies are especially mysterious and beautiful. \nLanguid and hot weather, at first glance, absolutely does not portend anything, as suddenly you can notice the rapid and sudden movement of gloomy clouds, which, filling the horizon, like a huge army going to war against the calm and gentle blessings of all nature.\nA moment later the first lightning also appears - it is majestic as a leader, so it is accompanied by a hymn-like melody of thunder.\nSoon the whole sky becomes dotted with shining zigzags that only intensify. The sky at such moments takes on mysterious and even terrifying features, but even here one can see the special beauty of nature.\n\nAll life dies down.\n",
