    "description": "On July 16th 2019 A beautiful severe warned storm was headed towards my home city. \nI was at work when I saw this storm on radar about 40 kilometres west of the city. The storm was moving east and I got lucky and got off work in time to head to out of the city east. This is where I found a perfect grid road that divided two fields of canola. I found a little ramp off for tractors and positioned my camera along the storms beautiful shelf cloud. \nThe combination of the vibrant canola and the glowing storm created a beautiful view. \nShortly after this shot the storm was right above me bringing torrential rain and large hail! it was an amazing storm chase right close to home which is very rare! \nWhile this storm wasn't the most severe it had an amazing shelf cloud that glowed! \n",
