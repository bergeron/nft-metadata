    "description": "“JPow: Money Go Brrr” is political parody that features U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, “making it rain” by shooting cash from a money gun - while flanked by Robert S. Kaplan, former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Eric S. Rosengren, former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  \n \nThis rare (one of one), political parody piece mocks the Federal Reserve system, its ability to print money, and the activities of its leadership that came into question following the Covid-19 pandemic. \n \nThe use of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the United States, to increase the aggregate money supply in the economy, leads to inflation. U.S. inflation breached 9.1% in June 2022, following the Fed’s Quantitative Easing, the highest in three decades. \n \nArtists \nBillie Halliday\nMarc Caisip",
