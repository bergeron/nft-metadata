    "description": "There's just something about flying in airplanes that brings out all my emotions. I don't know if it's the space for reflection or the idea of traveling through time... I don't know why I only cry in the sky. \n\nLyrics: \n\nI almost missed my flight\nOn my way to California\nIf I close my eyes\nI’ll get there in no time\nBut something bout the silence\nAnd sitting with strangers in a metal machine\nWelcomes all the flashbacks\nLeaving room to only think\n\nI’d like to pass the time\ni don’t know why I only cry in the sky \n\nI’m stirring my diet cola \nThe man beside me must be dreaming butterflies\n\nI’d like to pass the time\ni don’t know why I only cry in the sky \n\nThere’s something in the air that just wakes you up \nEverything seems small when you’re this high above\nI don’t really care flying in the sky\nThere’s something in the air that just wakes you up \nEverything seems small when you’re this high above\nI don’t really care flying in the sky\n\nVictims of our own devices\nSix seats in a row divided \nSudden like a strike of lightning \nFaded in a distance \n(Imagination, contemplating)\nThe same place as before \n(Relying on faith, having patience)\nWe're always wanting more \nI haven't felt bored ever since I was a kid\n\nI’d like to pass the time\ni don’t know why I only cry in the sky \n\nPerformed by TAROT\nWritten by TAROT\nProduced by Blake Burchette & Tate Gardner \nMixed by Nic Laz\nMastered by Gentry Studer ",
