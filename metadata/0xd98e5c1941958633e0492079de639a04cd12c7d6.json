    "description": "\"Infinite Knowledge\" deploys a mix of fun, fictional stories of human history and technology being molded by extra-terrestrial visitors and hidden stories of my ongoing life mixed into the medium; a form of artistic catharsis for me. I enjoy the idea that the collector gains a chance to view this as a puzzle of potential stories.\n\nCreated in Procreate and Photoshop | Total Strokes Made: 6503 | Tracked Time: 62 Hours | Size: 2160 x 2700 | File type: PNG | Date Created: 4/30/2022",
