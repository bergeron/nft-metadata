    "description": "The artwork uses a geometric three-dimensional approach to highlight different states of the artist's self on each day. The artist has transformed their emotions, experiences, and thoughts into visual form to convey them. With delicate and flexible painting techniques, they emphasize the uniqueness and irreplaceability of each day, and each painting serves as a momentary record that reveals the artist's innermost feelings and experiences.\n\nThis series of works is an impressive art project that explores various aspects of life, including the complex relationships between time, emotion, and personal experience. The painting is 150x150cm and created using acrylic medium. That is definitely worth paying attention to and appreciating.",
