    "description": "The name \"Utican\" refers to the idea of becoming a resident of Utica, a place in which I've spent a fair bit of time and started to feel at home. Utican represents a proud, celebratory realization that you don't need something in your life. You are no longer a resident of your past. Utica is more of a metaphor for that time of life, rather than the actual place. ",
