    "description": "“Todo Se Mueve” is my first self portrait that Ive ever released publicly. In it you see myself interacting with the solar system as it rotates into frame. I am holding up my left hand cuffing it over planet earth. The idea for this image was inspired from a Calle 13 song “Todo Se Mueve” in which the general expression is that movement is a basic principle of life. If something doesn’t move in some way then it probably doesn’t exist. From physical space, like stars and planets, to our thoughts and emotions, there’s a vibrational frequency to everything we are able to experience.  \n1/1  \nDigital Art  \n4050x5400px  \n2022",
