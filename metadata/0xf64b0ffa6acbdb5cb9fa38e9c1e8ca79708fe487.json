    "description": "“Source of our feelings is images, while in dreams the source of the images is feelings”.\nThese are self-portraits that I let become dreams.\nCamera, tripod and I. Nobody else.\n\nThe photographs are using the matrix to create beautiful jumping moments. Before each jump, I closed my eyes. Background behind the figure, blurred spots, tree branches – that’s what I saw. I strive for understanding: is our world a dream or real?\nThree photographs and performance acts remind us about real and temporary, dreams and reveries.\nJumping moments have titles provided  next to each artwork.\n\nArtwork by Daria Chemakina\ninstagram.com/midoinabyss",
