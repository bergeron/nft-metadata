    "description": "\"What may have looked like a simple tree in the beginning rose from the ground and now stands up in the forest, scaring a peasant working nearby. The absence of light in its eyes make the creature look soulless, and maybe dangerous. It could also remind us of No-Face in Spirited Away. Yet, in the picture, the only hostile person seems to be the man, with his fork pointed in direction of the creature. It is barely standing up and aside from pushing trees, it is unsure whether it wants to cause any harm.\"\n\nDigital painting by Jakub Jagoda, May 2022\n4032*2268px, 300 dpi",
