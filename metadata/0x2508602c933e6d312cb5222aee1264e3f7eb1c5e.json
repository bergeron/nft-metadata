    "description": "The definition of feminine beauty in this collection is that the beauty of a woman sometimes does not depend on things or attire. But it depends on the face shape and the proportions of that person's face. And the work in the collection will focus mostly on black and white, there may be some color coming in. I want to emphasize the black and white to highlight and shadows on the face of a woman who looks beautiful and aura even if it is black and white because black and white reminds us of purity and color reminds us to the freshness. Part of the background may have some color added to create balance of the image, otherwise the woman in the event will be lifeless. \n\n-Technique \n digital paint \n-Style\n realism\n-Size\n 1668x2388 px",
