    "description": "History and religion are inextricably linked to art. Legendary creators of the past repeatedly resorted to using biblical subjects for their works of art. Whether or not you believe in God, you can certainly say that there is good and evil on earth. These two forces are in irreconcilable confrontation with each other. Every day, in our lives, situations arise in which we decide which side to choose. But it is certain that in the end we will be responsible for our choices. This collection is my personal reading of the well-known biblical story. My personal triumph in my career as a photographer. \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
