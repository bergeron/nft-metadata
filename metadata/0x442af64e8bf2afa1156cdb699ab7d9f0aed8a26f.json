    "description": "This 333 generative art project takes the color gradient from artworks of eight incredible artists and combines them through a series of interleaving concentric squares. It is an homage to these artists and an appreciation of each of their distinctive styles. The artists featured in this project are Alison Blickle, Jennie Jieun Lee, Madeline Hollander, Katarina Zdjelar, Torey Thornton, and Brendan Fernandes.",
