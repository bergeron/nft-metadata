    "description": "WATCHING TV\nWritten by DEEGAN & Eldar Zey\nProduced by Eldar Zey & DEEGAN\nAlbum Art by DEEGAN\n\nThe aliens are looking down on our species. \nWondering how we let the beautiful Earth around us - rot away. \nWhile we surf through different blue light images, casting from various screens, the air gets dirtier and the water rises. \nDon't worry. \nThe screens will tell us what to do. \nThey tell us what to do every day. \n\nLyrics:\nI’m making it work\nI’m making it work\nOh nah nah\nI pray for the worst \nI pray for the worst\nOh nah nah\nI’m making you sure \nI’m making you sure\nOh nah nah\nThat all of our problems be obsolete coming the first \nChop it up makin' it burst\nPrayin' up all on my knees\nAnyone listening to me?\nNah nah\nMama be telling me, \"Please, (you're) supposed to be making them G's\"\nFollowing all of my dreams\nI could be making the cheese\nSupposed to be making them Gs\nSupposed to be catching them Zs\nOh no\n\nI failed to mention \nI got my blessings\nThrow out my wishes \nAnd learned all my lessons \nSmoke all my pressure \nStand with my chest up\nOh \nMy night alone\n\nI spend it watching TV\nHoping that you see me\nI know you withchyo friends right now \nWorking it out like I know you do\nAnd if you meet me\nSomewhere where the trees breath \nWe could get high in the morn'\nIn the summer time",
