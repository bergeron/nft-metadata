    "description": "In Greek mythology, Hippolyte is recognized as the Amazon queen who wears the magical corset gifted to her by her father Ares. The Amazons are wild and fiery women who were the daughters of Zeus and Hippolyta, and of Oedipus and Locrinus. Since her father Ares wished to enslave the goddess Athena, Hippolyte was never born but was raised in the courts of Eurystheus, the father of Eurystheus and of Oedipus. This cult was present during the time of Oedipus and Oedipus. Athena worshiped the Amazon goddess on her island of Elysium in Greece. Hippolyte was first mentioned by Hesiod, and has been frequently referenced since by other writers. Since the goddess was mentioned by Herodotus, Hippolyte is believed to have been given a cult image on Crete. The closest to a cult image of Hippolyte in todayâ€™s world was that dedicated in the Middle Ages to Saint Joan of Arc.\n\nBut as we all know, religion is prone to magic and fantasy. It is why the whole scenario with the Amazon cult in Rome is questionable. In Athens, we have the reality of all the Amazons, and in Rome, we have a fantasy of the Amazon goddess.",
