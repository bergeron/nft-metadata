    "description": "Panspermia is an experiment to understand the relationship of aggregated architectural elements -  audio-physical architecture. The project is inspired by astrophysical science of panspermia hypothesis, indicating that micro organisms present in outer space initiated existence of being on earth.\n\nGoing with the speculative of panspermia, the sci-fi parts are designed as an impression of a self conscious machine with intact, a soul. The aim was to generate parts that would output their plane orientations, aggregating distinct spawn dimensions with each part added. As the parts are being aggregated, they output their plane orientation as well as distance previous part added to origin of aggregation. Output being, distinct M.I.D.I signal, depending on the setting and constraints given.",
