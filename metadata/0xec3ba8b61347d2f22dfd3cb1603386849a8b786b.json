    "description": " Colorways is Jenny Sharaf’s first voyage into the NFT medium and crypto conceptual art space. Her previous new media work includes an artist residency at Google, experimenting with VR and AR, in relation to a physical mural installation. This new practice of vectorizing and animating a painting, according to a complex randomization of thousands of carefully constructed color palette combinations, feels like a real painting process- intuitive and giving room for the clumsy gesture of the algorithm’s expression.",
