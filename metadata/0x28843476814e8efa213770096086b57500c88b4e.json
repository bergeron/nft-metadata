    "description": "The collection 'Desire' is dedicated to various feelings and states of a person, as well as their realization in the surrounding world. Each work is a specific code of meanings and symbols that collectively describe a particular phenomenon of a human personality. The interpretation of feelings is not linear and stereotyped and hides deeper logical chains and relationships. The name of the collection is dictated by one of the basic human feelings that make this world move and develop.\n",
