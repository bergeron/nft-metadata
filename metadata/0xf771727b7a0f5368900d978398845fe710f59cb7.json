    "description": "yo, we're dan & alex. we're best friends from a small town in upstate new york and we've been producing together since 2018. this is our first solo artist release on sound & very excited to be a part of the web3 community. \n\nhighscore is the first song we've ever entirely produced, written & recorded ourselves. we're extremely proud of this song & its message. the song is about the struggle of creating & constantly trying to make something of yourself. the lyrics are very personal to us & we're excited for this song in particular as it's the first of many 100% original work. \n\nhighscore shows our unique perspective on the creative\nprocess & how we push each other to succeed in music,\nmaking it the perfect introduction to cudos.",
