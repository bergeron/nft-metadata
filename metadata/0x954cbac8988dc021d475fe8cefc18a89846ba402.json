    "description": "\"Release The Energy\"\nhug the balloon gently \ncan\nliberate\nthe locked woman\n\nNote: This is not a long bar key with a male symbol, but an oval balloon key, rthe energy will be released to free the locked woman as hugging her.  The action of inserting a long bar key into a lock is very metaphorical, and using an oval key is a symbol of civilization.\n\n\nMost of the traditional keys are rectangular in shape, and the male symbol is so strong, and the action of inserting the key into the lock to unlock is also very aggressive to women, while the key of modern civilization, either by swiping a card, only needs to be swiped , either similar to a car key, just need to press, or enter a password, such a simple action, behind it turned out to be a symbol of civilization and progress.\n",
