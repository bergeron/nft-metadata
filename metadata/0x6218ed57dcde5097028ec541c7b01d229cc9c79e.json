    "description": "\"A knight in a red suit helped a lost girl.\"\n\nIn a place where no one knew her, a girl in a pink kimono stood alone amidst ruins. She was lost, alone, and didn't know where to go or what to do. She prayed to God, begging for help to get out of this place. She repeated her pleas year after year. Finally, she met a knight in a red suit who came to her rescue. He guided her to where she came from or where she wanted to go.\n\nArt by Isungkang (ISK)\n4961 x 6142 px",
