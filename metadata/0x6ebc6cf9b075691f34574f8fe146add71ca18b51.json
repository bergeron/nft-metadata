    "description": "Do This Myself is a collection of 2,773 unique images living on the Ethereum blockchain. This collection spans 12 years of my life as a producer and artist. Included in the images are friends, family, and artists that were in my life at the time of capture. By owning a moment of Do This Myself, you are holding a snapshot of my past and aiding to support my future. Holders of a portrait will be airdropped a music video containing all the images from the collection. Future utilities will include access to Aryay affiliated NFTâ€™s, the opportunity to win a one-on-one production lesson with Aryay, and access to exclusive Aryay samples.",
