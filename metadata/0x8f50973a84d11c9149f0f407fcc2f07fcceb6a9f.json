    "description": "In fact,all the characters of my paintings,look like to myown face.\nWomen with sad and colorful eyes.\nHalf in the dark,and half in the light.\nIn my opinion,every human, beying has a shadow that they hides from others.\nMy self portraites are not free from this principle.\nBut the eyes are the mirror of the heart.\nEven if one lies,the eyes show the most right.",
