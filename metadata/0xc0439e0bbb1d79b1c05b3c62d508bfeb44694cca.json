    "description": "star of david (part1)  \nview on the western wall ,Jerusalem\n\nThe Star of David is a symbol of the unity of opposites (black - white, right - left, up-down, good and bad ...) a symbol of integration and connection, a symbol of God's protection, a symbol of protection in general, and a symbol of future redemption.  \nIt gives us identity, tradition, customs, beliefs, and creates a way of life.\n\nIts origins are unknown in the depths of the past, and its history is too complicated to ever be circumvented.  \nIn this series of artworks, we turn key sites in Israel into a Star of David that unites the many opposites that exist in our society.\n\n\nTechnique: Kinetic photography - light painting, long exposure while rotating the camera on its axis, creating this special magic. the photographs are without software/Photoshop involvement.",
