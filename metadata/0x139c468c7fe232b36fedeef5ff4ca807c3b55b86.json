    "description": "I both grow and photograph the most delicate and colorful animals on the planet. It's no secret that coral are my favorite subject to photograph, and blue color morphs are some of the rarest you can find, especially of this species. When you start to zoom in and notice all of the tiny details of what's in frame, that's when my imagination runs wild.\n\nThis metadata will be updated as I think of better ways to communicate just how much I love this piece, but for now, just enjoy what's in frame ;)",
