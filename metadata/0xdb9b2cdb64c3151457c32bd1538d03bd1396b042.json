    "description": "The Japanese adjective akai (赤い) serves as a common designation in the gamut of red. Its meaning is described as \"the colour of fresh blood\". In Japanese, though, the common root aka- has the elements akai and akarui meaning light, so red is primarily a representation of the sun dispelling darkness.",
