    "description": "Himalayas, Nepal, 4000m altitude.\n\nTrue wind of freedom cannot be felt in a crowded metropolis.\nTo feel it, you need to make an effort on yourself. Get off your comfortable couch and literally go beyond your usual limits. \nAnd when everything superfluous remains below, and you are above the clouds, you understand that only the human spirit is able to make  true achievements and changes in the world. The main thing to remember is always.\n\nEdition: 1/1 \nLocation: Himalayas mountains, Langtang region, Nepal\nArtist: Yevhen Samuchenko (Q-lieb-in)\nLicense: Extended Editorial",
