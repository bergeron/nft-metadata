    "description": "Look at this piece from a distance and you can appreciate the beauty and wonder of the child as she gazes at a small, winged horse surrounded by sparkles and flashes of light.  \n\nTake a close look and you can appreciate the fine details from the background texture to the paisley in her outfit. It manages to be both simple and very complex at the same time.  \n\nThe mixed media background was created with paper, newsprint, acrylic paint, acrylic medium, and spray paint. \n\nI first conceived this artwork around 2017 as I sat in the hospital room with my father. I wanted to experience that childlike wonder ... to go back to the days of innocence. A time when we didn't understand things the way we do as adults. When things could be scary and fascinating at the same time.\n\nI hope you can appreciate these details and will enjoy it as a part of your collection. I certainly had a great time bringing this piece to life.",
