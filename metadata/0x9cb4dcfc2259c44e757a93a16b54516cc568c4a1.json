    "description": "I captured this image from a boat while crossing the river. It was the very last light of the day, and the boat was creating some nice waves on which the contrast of light and shadow was so beautiful to see. I tried to capture this contrast between light and darkness, using horizontal camera movements to take a step out of reality, while focusing on the light.\n\nLocation: La Montagne, France. River: La Loire",
