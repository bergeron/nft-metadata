    "description": "I'm so excited to present my Genesis drop song to my Sound.XYZ Family. I wrote this record the day after my grandfather passed away. I was feeling so low about everything in my life. This was a reminder and a motivator to myself and others who are experiencing trauma and ultimately a rough time. Life is a continuum. It keeps moving despite our lows. I encourage you to love yourself enough to move with the shift.
