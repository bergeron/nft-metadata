    "description": "This photography was taken on my last trip to Madrid, in the crystal palace in \"El parque del Bueno Retiro\". In this palace there is an installation by Pauline Boudry and Renate Lorenz, where dry ice is thrown in the form of smoke inside the entire glass building. The light that enters through the glass takes us to another time, another era, ghost towns full of smoke and a nostalgia, moment full of meaning and ephemeral felling",
