    "description": "I was wandering through equations, as an everyday habit, when I encountered it. They call it Collatz conjecture, Ulam conjecture, and many other names. I like to call it 3x + 1, one of the simple rules of life. During visualizing the formula I found many organic visualization which caught my attention. The more I dig in, the more I felt like a roamer.\nIn the above work, I put all the natural numbers up to one hundred in the formula. As can be seen, even numbers reach the 4-2-1 loop sooner, but odd numbers tend to take their time before falling in the loop. In the process, when I wanted to scale numbers which go higher than what I consider so that they could visualize better, I encountered a logical error in my code; twenty-seven, for example, goes up to 9232. This makes an error which you can see in the top left of the visualization.\n\nAs Nietzshe said: \"A great truth wants to be criticized not idolized\"\n\n16300x16300 px - PNG\nMade entirely with code written in P5.js, June 2022",
