    "description": "She was from another space and experience. The culture I have seen, many a time through my lens, was a glamorous distant experience for her. And that was the very reason why she flew to India.\nTagging along her people and strangers, she let her hair down and took a handful of \"Holi\"  shades, toss it towards the march skyâ€¦\nMarch is the month of \"Holi\". People around India, especially in northern part, celebrate \"Holi\" with colors, food, music and let loose in the festival.\nTo her the splash of color around her, jolted her heart, cheerfully all the way.\n She lived her dream that day, unknowingly finding herself shy and smiling to the sweet loudness of togetherness.\n\nEDITION : 1/1\n\n",
