    "name": "Mimosa",
    "description": "at the end of the war in 1946, the Italian people, who came out as a ruined country, are looking for a new light of hope for life. At this time, 3 women named Terasa Mattei, Terasa Noce, Rita Mognagnana, members of the Italian Women's Union, think that it will be with a work called “Women's Solidarity” to rebuild society.They decide that the thing that will best symbolize these thoughts should also be a flower. However, with the mimosa having many features that are different from other flowers, it was decided to mimosa. The characteristics of the mimosa were as follows;\n-Women's Day with its flowering in March.\n-It should not require much effort in its maintenance until it becomes a large tree (because Italy was also wanted to recover immediately).\n-Although they are fragile and naive in terms of their structure, they actually have a strong character, especially their structures that are resistant to cold and weather events.",
