    "description": "“ghost” was made over a series of discord video calls late last year. Darby and I had been discussing the healing journey, and how someone (or something) can leave a void in your life after they're gone. This echo can't be moved on from until you confront your past. Sonically, we wanted this track to be layered with texture and ambience, and have chords that gave you the feeling of that emotional tug of war. Clover's speech (the spoken word intro) represents the resolution to this- that you need to make peace with your past in order to move forward and heal. Our goal was to make something that would uplift and inspire people going through similar struggles.",
