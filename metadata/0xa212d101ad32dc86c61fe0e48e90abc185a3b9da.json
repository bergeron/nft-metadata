    "name": "Ecotar-Style 3D Full Body Sculpture Certificate #2",
    "description": "This is a one-time purchase certificate. By buying this certificate you order an Ecotar-style 3D model of anyone (yourself, your friends or relatives, even your pet). Our 3D design Team of 10+ professionals that worked on the Ecotar NFTs will create a full body sculpture of the desired person and record its video presentation resembling other tokens in the collection. You'll also receive the source file of the model enabling you to print its physical copy on a 3D printer.\n\nTo use this offer you must buy this certificate token from ElectronicTeam, and send the request to parnerships@ecotars.com to agree on further details of the order.\n\nNOTE: Only the initial purchase of this token from ElectronicTeam grants its owner the right to use the certificate and to order a 3D model. The ordering customer takes responsibility for all possible copyright issues.\n",
