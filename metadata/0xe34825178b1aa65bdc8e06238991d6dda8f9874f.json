    "description": "Honestly, this is probably my favorite image I have ever created…When I saw this film scan for the first time, I was astonished that I had created something so beautiful. Usually when I see my scans, I get super excited, look through them, take note on what I can do better next time and then am ready to move forward.  For months I would go back and look at this image and feel happy.\n\nEven though this isn’t the oldest image in the collection, it is the one that sparked the idea of continuing to create similar images.",
