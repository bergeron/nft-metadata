That's what I felt while doing this project between 2017 and 2019 in Pomabamba, a little town in the Peruvian Andes, at the Ayacucho Region. These pictures are part of my exploration of the place while getting attached to it day by day. People I met, their culture, their religiosity, and some situations I encountered with.\n\nTaken on 120 film 6x6.\n\nImportant note:\n50% of the profits from this collection will be given among the locals of Pomabamba or the people portrayed in certain images.
