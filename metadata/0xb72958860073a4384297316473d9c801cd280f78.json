    "description": "\"Took a demon by her hands, asked the demon, Can we dance? Found a halo in her trash but she doesn't talk about her past\". These are lyrics that inspired this piece.\nAt first glance, An innocent-looking woman but in her shadow, we see some Horns. They represent the evil in her which grow from the scars that remain after our hurt. We all start with our halos count yourself lucky if you finish with them. Finally, when next you find yourself in the dark, check again you just might see your horns.",
