    "description": "This Image i took during my one of my extreme winter photo expedition to Ladakh India. It was very difficult place as the temperature is around -15 to -20 degree celsius. \nThere was no accommodation nearby so i stayed some 4 hours  away from this extreme location.\nI got up 1'o clock in the morning to reach there in right light condition.\nThough this lake was completely frozen but some parts were having thin ice layer from where turquoise colour was evidently seen.",
