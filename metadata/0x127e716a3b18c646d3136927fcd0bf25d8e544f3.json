    "description": "Unlike 1st Level NFT, the 2nd Level depends on the size of your donation. An equivalent of $15,000 or more will automatically result in solo NFT with a 3D render. This NFT means the donor supports one family unless they want to donate more and build more houses. Solo and group NFTs are different visually.",
