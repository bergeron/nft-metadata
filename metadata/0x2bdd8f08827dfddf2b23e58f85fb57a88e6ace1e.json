    "name": "Love - Zhang Huan's Sapp Glacier No.1",
    "description": "Zhang Huan returned to the holy Sapp mountain, struggled with fever and altitude sickness to have a dialogue with the glacier in the severe environment, then he started a conceptual painting. He originated a new form of painting in the history of art, by using transparent film to trace and recreate the Sapp Glacier in the heart. Through the performance that integrated with nature, he realized that the power of love comes from nature.",
