    "description": "Petroglyphs in caves, cuneiform on clay tablets, hieroglyphs on papyrus, letters on paper, emoji on our gadget screens, symbols are everywhere, but we know so little about them. \n\nSymbols are all around us. The proximity of symbols to the individual creates the hidden nature of the symbols themselves. We use symbols but do not understand their nature.\n\nWe think we have created the symbols but it may be that the symbols have created us, accompanied us through history, created, raised and remembered our culture, following us wherever we go. \n\nThe symbol is the boundary between the material world and the world of information and phenomena. I would like those who have felt a response, through my work, to immerse themselves with me in a world of pure information and phenomena.",
