    "description": "This is not a place, and I am not real here. Away from everything and everyone else... That place beyond good and evil is the place of \"No\". I wasn't brittle enough to break here, my shell was just hard, and in this place that seemed darker than twilight, since my own shell was gone, something now welled up in me from far away, outside. . But this is where the desolation is, here dark trains pass, the wind blows, here the waves return and the eddies drag you into that endless void. Everything in this place is ashen, gray. Neither the merciless darkness of black binds my eyes, nor the pure brilliance of white... Everything is dusty, like the remains of a war. Here is that place, with the shrill echoes of destruction and the charred marks of fire. Let it be known that this war within me is over. I'm not on duty either. There is no place here.",
