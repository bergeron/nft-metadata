    "description": "Guardian Sitael loves peace and quiet, so he guards his little world of eternal sunset and dawn. This world is unique in that sunsets and sunrises occupy most of the time of the day, so the flora and fauna in it is peculiar. Sitael loves the delightful ruby color surrounding her little world.",
