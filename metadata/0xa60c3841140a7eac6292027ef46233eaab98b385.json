    "description": "The inception of Netflix occurred whilst I created a remix for Reo Cragun’s Zoom competition with Arpeggi Labs. When the opportunity arose, I swore that I was going to seize it. My goal was to make everyone who heard it say “Ayo… Who the hell is this guy?”. Well, I guess it worked, because it got me here.\n\nIn honour of the remix that led me to my Genesis on Sound, I remixed my own remix! Taking vocals from the initial track, I flipped the acapella in true grime fashion, building a new track with the essence of Elcee the Alchemist. \n\nDon’t be fooled however, this is only the tip of the iceberg. I intend to spin your head with each release, exposing new parts of my soul and bringing you deeper into my mind. I’m on a journey to express the most obscure nuances of my existence, from the highest highs to the lowest lows, from the wildest mosh pits to those solitary moments. I hope to bring you all on my journey, as I hope I can become a part of yours. \n\nHere’s to new beginnings <3",
