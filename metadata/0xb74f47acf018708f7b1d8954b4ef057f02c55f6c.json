    "description": "Weedy are 420Land's official NFTs, which you can collect or use within the first Play to Earn Cannabis Metaverse. Each Weedy has distinctive features that give it an intrinsic value. Weedys are nice little rockets who love to launch themselves into pure relaxation. They get mad when they run out of high-CBD weed. Proud of their peaceful 'bombs', they strive for new varieties and sensations. And they are always ready to advise their less experienced brothers - like real cannabis sommeliers. Find out more at [420Land](https://www.420land.eu/).",
