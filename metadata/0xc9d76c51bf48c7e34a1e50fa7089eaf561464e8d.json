    "description": "2020\nJPEG, 3000 x 3000 pixels, 300ppi\n\n“Renatured” is a series of images created with molecular visualization software and models of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus spike protein. The project explores entanglements of biology, technology, and culture through a procedural lens informed by the design of scientific imaging software. The folded protein states or “conformations” were unraveled using specialized features of the software in unconventional ways and were arranged to create kaleidoscopic meditations on natural and constructed worlds. The colors were chosen for their references to nature, such as plants and animals, implied in the software’s naming conventions. The titles in the “Renatured” series echo these names that are evocative of idyllic representations of the natural world (blue skies, green forests, ripe fruit, romantic flowers) and reveal additional layers of abstraction built into the interfaces of the technologies we use to engage with and manipulate nature.",
