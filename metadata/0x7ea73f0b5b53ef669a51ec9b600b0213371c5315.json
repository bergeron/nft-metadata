    "description": "When the weight of the world feels heavy, remember that your shoulders have held up mountains. That your eyes tell stories that some people may never believe. And your heart, as battered and bruised as it may be, has crossed oceans just to get you here. You see your body, your soul, you…were made to bend but not break. To sway in the wind, but never fall. And when the rest of the world feels like it’s crumbling at its core, we will still be here….together, adrift in this world that we call home and I’m excited to hear the stories that your eyes tell. \n\nA quiet morning spent ~1000 feet above Chicago watching the waves of fog drift through the city.",
