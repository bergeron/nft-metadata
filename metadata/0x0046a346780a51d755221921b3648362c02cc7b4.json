    "description": "After years of shortages, inflation, insecurity and attacks on critical thinking, the people of Venezuela decided that the government of Nicolas Maduro was illegitimate. The streets of Caracas and the principal cities of the country starts to get full of angry people tired of the current situation. The regime was violent and strongly repressed the protests where thousands were injured and there were dozens of deaths.\n\nThis work means a lot to me, as a press photographer, I was attacked by the national guard who shot me a few meters away, causing a broken leg. Months later, I was again persecuted by the political police of the Maduro regime for which I fled my country.",
