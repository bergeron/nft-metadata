    "description": "California\nNovember 4, 2016\n\n*“It is popular to believe that we are more disconnected from nature than ever before. Cody Cobb is trying to show that even in a place as vast and rich as a Western American landscape our present, past, and future are at all times intertwined and that our creations and the soul we infuse them with may be more natural than what is commonly believed. This is greatly important because an ecology of this planet can only begin with an acceptance of the world as it is: natural and unnatural, alive and dead, complex and simple, but always right in front of you, at hand, and worth your undivided attention.”*\n\n– Cooper Nash Blade\n\n**DEAD_028**",
