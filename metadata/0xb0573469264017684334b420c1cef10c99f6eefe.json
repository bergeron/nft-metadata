    "description": "Take a deep breath and enjoy the smell of the fresh aroma of the lavender field.  \nImagine you experience this under millions of stars in a warm night.\n\nThis is what I dreamed of for a long time when I saw pictures of the French lavender fields in Valensole.  \nAfter the first lockdown in June 2020 was over I sat in the car after work at 12PM and drove for eight hours straight to make this dream come true.\n\nIt couldn't have been better. \nI parked the car at the side of the road to the field and prepared everything for the night.  \nTwo of my friends were already there and joined me after my arrival.  \nStung by two bees during walking through the field and a glass of wine in my friends campervan let me dream even better of this place.  \nAt around midnight the milkyway showed his photogenic beauty and it was time to get out the camera.\n\nFor this picture I took several photos of the sky to get a panorama of the milkyway and put them together with the lavender field. \nThe image I had in mind was born.",
