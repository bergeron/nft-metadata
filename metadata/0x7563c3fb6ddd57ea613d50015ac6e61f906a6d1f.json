    "description": "Imagine living in the city of Tokyo in 2030. Now try to smell the noise and the scent of the rain, and see the light of hope that comes from the city. I have a little dream in the drawer, try to make people aware of being less discriminating.I created this collection that I called “Tokyo 2030 🌈”imagining a city of the future where the light of hope will shine. Each piece sold 10% will be donated to lgbt 🏳️‍🌈 associations",
