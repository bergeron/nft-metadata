    "description": "Peace of Mind is a unique combination of oil pastels and collage, using soft spring colors that evoke a sense of tranquillity and joy. The artwork is inspired by the idea of finding peace of mind, and captures the moment of staring at blue skies and breathing in the fresh spring air whilst living in a bustling city.\n\nThe use of different textures creates a busy but clean layered effect that invites the viewer to get lost in the view and find inner peace.\n\nThe work is a celebration of spring & a reminder to look forward to the future. \n\nNobody can bring you peace but yourself.",
