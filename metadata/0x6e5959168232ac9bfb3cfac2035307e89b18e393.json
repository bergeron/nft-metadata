    "description": "Bless Art is a collection that I created to support one of my friends who is very talented, and in whom I believe. Don't worry, he gave me the right to publish his works of art. The number of items that may be included in this collection is not determined as there will be from time to time a release of new items. All works in this collection are drawn by my friend, and I am only using BEING_243 to show the world the originality, authenticity of my friend's work. Currently, this collection has no account on Twitter nor on Instagram or Discord. So, don't fall on scams. I won't give all details about the way he does his work, but trust me the items are worth the cost. I very much hope that you will enjoy this collection because that will be a way for me to prove him that I am not the only one who admire his work and efforts. Thanks!",
