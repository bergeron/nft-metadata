    "description": "In movies that I make, I am sculpting in time. Like Tarkovsky who inspires me.\n\nFor the \"Dancer Dots\" digital art project, it was about scanning multiple portions of that time and then digging through that scan to find the best frame possible.\n\nThis frame was extracted from a LiDAR scanning session with Maya. It was then enhanced and color graded.\n\nMaya is a contemporary dancer who explores the slow and the self. A constant and slow movement between the inside and the outside. Like a pendulum.\n\nThe core ideas of the project are:\n\n- Show dance and movement differently, using technology.\n- Giveback to the dancers and dance communities.\n- As a collector, be an important part of a project (gifts, be a part of the creative process)\n- Get enough funds to make a 3D animation short film with scanned dancers or collectors.\n- Split the profits with everyone participating in this project (dancers, collectors, animators...etc.)\n\nFor more information, on this project: https://www.dancerdots.com/\n\n",
