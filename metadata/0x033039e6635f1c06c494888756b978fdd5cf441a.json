    "name": "The nostalgic lion",
    "description": "The lion in the zoo gradually becomes accustomed to the artificial environment. Every time he sees the sun at dusk to remember savanna of his birthplace but he won't be back to there. Wild animals accept the current environment, waiting for the day when they will eventually leave this world. We humans sometimes experience unexpectedly as well. Instead of realistic depiction, I expressed the divergence and fusion between reality and nostalgia by integrating the light and the lion's mane.",
