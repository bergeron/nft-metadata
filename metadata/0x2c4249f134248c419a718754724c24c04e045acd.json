    "description": "2.22.22\n\nThere is an intimate dialogue between each crystal I create in the lab, where I am continuously use my intuition, attention, and patience to derive once chemical formulas and physical densities to a not so arbitrary lattice structure to life that enchants me everytime.\n\nAs I hold my breath when I look through the microscope lens, I understand the mathematical and chemical components of this piece of perfection under the glass. \n\nAs humans evolve, our attention spans and sense of patience start to diminish with new advancements in technology. I am grateful that this kind of work gives me some degree of humility, where I acknowledge there is a lot I cannot see under the naked eye. My perception of the things around me tend to feel a bit too ordinary or move too fast at times, but microscopes and rearranging atomic structures allow me to slow down my mind and wander within on a certain scale.
