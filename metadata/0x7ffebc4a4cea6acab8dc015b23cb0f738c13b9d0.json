    "description": "when I ran away from home for the third time, many people helped me. after that I met a lot of new people and friends. I had fun, I loved people. but recently my father to bought the police, I was kept in a cell in terrible conditions and brought to another city to my parents' house. I ran away again. someone tried to help me for a while. someone offered to help me, but disappeared. some people just don't care. Now I cannot leave the house without fear for myself. I canâ€™t go to work, I live on the accumulated money. I'm just glad that I can draw every day. but my view of the world has already changed and my soul is poisoned.",
