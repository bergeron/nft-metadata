    "name": "Unity with nature",
    "description": "The first girl in the collection is presented in a romantic, gentle way.  It symbolizes peace, unity with nature.  That feeling when you are in nature, alone or not, when nature stretches around from all sides, when the smells of flowering herbs, mixing, create a unique aroma, and inhaling it, you feel that you are living ... Thoughts become clearer, feelings become sharper  , time slows down... Painting on canvas, oil.",
