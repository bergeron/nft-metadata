    "description": "“One, two, three: throw!” Repeat… Repeat… Repeat… Whether it was the mistiming of the shutter press, or of the fabric being thrown, my initial reactions to this image were to laugh at the fact the fabric had wrapped around the dancer’s head like this, then to earmark the file for trash. But something about the image intrigued me and kept bringing me back to it in the days that followed. What I had been so quick to dismiss initially as a failed composition began to show itself as unique and beautiful.",
