    "description": "Must Admit is my most transparent track to date. On this track I leave it out in the open about a past relationship that ended in way that left me wounded. Le Mav produced the track with me in Lagos Nigeria last year. The sonics on this track is our signature sound. I immediately found the hook. \"I must I must admit I must\" The verses took me time to write. Through out the verses I breakdown the honesty of leaving someone you love but shouldn't be with. The song was very therapeutic to me. I feel like there's a point in life where you need to let go and just admit EXACTLY how you feel no matter the repercussions.",
