    "description": "In a time not too far in the future, most of us people have already moved to the digital world of Metaverse. However, a lot of communities in our society are having some difficulty accepting the idea of this unusual and strange piece of technology. \n\nLeaders and people have neglected their neighborhoods. Everyone in downtown is too busy building a new life in the new world, creating a massive gap and a huge contradiction between what we were and what we are about to become. \n\nThis outsider on the other hand, is here to learn about this “underdeveloped” neighborhood trying to find new ways to convince its people for them to make this unwanted shift. This shift that we still don’t know what it is and how it is going to affect humanity. Will it affect us to the better or to the worse?\n\n",
