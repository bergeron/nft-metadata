    "description": "As an artist with a background in comics I can’t help but to love working with line art, and I feature it heavily in my works.\nHowever, sometimes I like to experiment with different types of render styles, and Fall From Grace was such an attempt.  \n\nThis artwork is actually an older illustration of mine from a couple of years ago.\nI painted her to test and see if the iPad Pro could be a viable substitute for my usual drawing setup. \nThe test was a success as I today use the iPad for almost everything art related.  \n\nPNG \n2480x3100",
