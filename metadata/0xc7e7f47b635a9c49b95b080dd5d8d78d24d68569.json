    "description": "Your journey has lead you to this cold and barren platform; in your possession are the 6 gemstones that you have previously collected. A searing light cuts through the space infront of you, and a Goblet magically appears...The legendary Goblet of Infinite Drams, often known as the Infinity Goblet, gently floats a couple of meters above ground, in an alternate dimension, otherwise known as the MetaVerse. Encrusted into the goblet, are the 6 gemstones that you have previously collected from your journey thus far... It's true origins are still a mystery to most people, other than the fact, that it will only appear infront of the individual with these 6 specific gemstones, while standing infront of the platform. The Goblet serves as a VIP membership card for Malt, Grain & Cane's exclusive promotions. Owners of this Goblet are strongly advised to guard it closely, for it may bring greater fortunes in the future.",
