    "description": "The Lagoon and Trifid Nebulae.  These birthplaces of stars sit in the core of our Milky Way galaxy and are a Summer night treat to see.  This image was taken in a fairly dark sky (Bortle Class 4) in Virginia.  The pink and blue colors are the ionized Hydrogen and other gases that when condensed by the pull of gravity, will form new stars!  The nebulae sit in a large star field with millions of other stars pictured. \n\nPhotographer: Jason Betzner\n\nCollection: Deep Space\n\nEdition: 1/1 NFT\n\nLocation: Williamsburg, Virginia, USA\n\nYear Created: 2022\n\nGenre: Astrophotography\n\nGear: Canon EOS 6D, Star Adventurer Pro tracker, William Optics Z61ii refractor.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
