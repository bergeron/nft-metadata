    "description": "Lockdown Soap Bubbles Studies is a collection of works born out of the 2020 pandemic, and part of the wider _Soap Bubbles Studies_ photography series which depicts soap bubbles floating in front of uninhabited natural landscapes. In place of the natural settings characteristics of the original images, Plank uses a photography backdrop of kitsch landscapes set up in her own backyard. \n\nStarted as a direct response to the travel restrictions imposed by Covid-19, the backdrop element of _Lockdown_ offers a humorous twist on the impersonal photos of palm trees and idyllic beaches, for instance, prevalent as floor-to-ceiling wallpaper in the 70s and 80s. The resulting photographs donâ€™t disguise the use of a backdrop; the highly saturated colours hint at an artificial perfection.\n\nEach sale made from this series will contribute to the continuation of my long-term project Soapbubble Studies. All Collectors will receive a postcard from my next shooting location. \n\nThere will be 3 hand-signed Fine Art Prints with 50x70cm raffled to a collector picked randomly as soon the whole series is sold out.",
