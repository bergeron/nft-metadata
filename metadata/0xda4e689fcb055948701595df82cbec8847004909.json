    "description": "Portraiture is one of my favourite art genres . What makes it so magical is its ability to depict not only the physical but also psychological characteristics of a figure.\n\nI enjoy studying the different shapes and expressions of faces, limiting my palette to just two colours to captivate the essence of the portrait rather than to copy everything I see. I enjoy making my own interpretations and transforming features and elements to my liking. Some of these studies are developed into more elaborated and final artworks. \n\nThis study is done in blue and orange color pencils. Once I finish the studies, I enjoy giving them names that I feel suits them. I called this one Elena. \n\nÂ© Raquel Casilda\n",
