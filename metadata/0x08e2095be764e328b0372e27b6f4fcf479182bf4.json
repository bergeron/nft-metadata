    "description": "LNRZ SZN 2 WK 3\n\nMija and DEEGAN. Fire and Ice. Two powerhouses of the web3 music scene are here for SZN 2, and we couldn't be more stoked\n\n\"Ghost\" is a dark and catchy song that has been stuck in our heads ever since we first heard it.\n\nHere is a (wild) quote from Deegan about the song:\n\n\"It feels like if Charlie XCX guest-starred on an episode of SpongeBob and performed a song in the bizzaro underworld location where everyone speaks with a tongue fart accent. The song even features claves which remind me of Gary the snail’s eyes smacking together. This is probably the 3rd song I’ve released singing in a British accent. I have tons more though.\"\n\nJoin LNRZ HQ here: https://guild.xyz/lnrz-hq",
