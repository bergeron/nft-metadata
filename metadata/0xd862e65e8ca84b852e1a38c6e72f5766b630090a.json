    "description": "Whether we like it or not, we all small parts of the body called “planet Earth”. Even if we don’t realize it. \nEven if the impact seems to be small. Everyone’s daily actions contribute positively or negatively to the ecosystem. And what do you personally bring to the planet?\n\nThe Gaia hypothesis, also known as the Gaia theory or Gaia paradigm, proposes that living organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings on Earth to form a synergistic and self-regulating, complex system that helps to maintain and perpetuate the conditions for life on the planet.\n\nCurator: Weronika Kozior\nVisual: Ekaterina Malakhova \nMusic: Tomasz Szwelnik",
