    "description": "A very special place near Lisbon, in Portugal. This beach is quite hard to access with no easy track and a downhill path that can make you think twice on getting there. Its all worth though, as you get to an extremely special beach, very private, very untouched, no cellphone signal and with this peculiar bear shapped rock that names this beach \"Bear Beach\" Can you see it? ;)‚Å†",
