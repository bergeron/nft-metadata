    "description": "Zach Gill - Piano, Vocals, Songwriting\n\nZach Gill is a multi-instrumentalist, singer/songwriter most known for his work with ALO and Jack Johnson. He’s performed for presidents, alongside rock stars, on television, and in historic venues throughout the world.\n\nEveryone Orchestra’s Heart Full of Love is a 20th Anniversary Celebration produced by Matt Butler and Todd Kushnir. \n\n73 incredible artists participated in this project. Virtually conducted, digital files were sent back and forth and then overlaid, mixed and mastered to become a magnum opus for Everyone Orchestra - a true and wide-ranging celebration of creativity, collaboration, community, and improvisation. A fun and happy song meant to lift your hearts and spirits. In a time when hopefulness can be hard to come by, and the music industry is once again being wrought with cancellations and lost touring opportunities, our hope is to raise the vibration as much as we can by putting out this work, at this time.\n\nProduced by  \nMatt Butler & Todd Kushnir  \nNFT Design, Editing, & Sound - KUSH  \nc.2022\n\nFULL MUSIC VIDEO HERE:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8aPlXFkK0",
