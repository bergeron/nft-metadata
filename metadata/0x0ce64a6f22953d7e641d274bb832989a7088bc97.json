    "description": "During the early stages of AI generative art, people would type \"/Imagine\" as a prompt to request the AI to generate the desired image. \n\nBut instead of showcasing the AI-generated artworks in the gallery, I've decided to flip the script and exhibit the prompt itself as a work of art.\n\nPrompt is Art, it represents a memorable moment in the history of art. It signifies that art is not just limited to human imagination but also involves the collaboration between humans and AI.  ",
