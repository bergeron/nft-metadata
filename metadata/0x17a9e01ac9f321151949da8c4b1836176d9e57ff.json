For some, this is a new concept, while others have perfected the art of WFH over the course of many years. Our protagonist, WFH DEGEN, enters Monday morning to an OGmail filled with gm and endless reply guy chirps on twitter.\n\n\nWFH is an acronym for “work from home” which describes work being done remotely, instead of at an office. This is the WFH DEGEN. \nWe are all the WFH DEGEN and the WFH DEGEN is all of us.",
