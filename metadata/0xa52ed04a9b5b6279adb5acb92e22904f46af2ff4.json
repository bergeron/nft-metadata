    "description": "The first drop by ensō is a collaboration with Mija and showcases her \"Game Over\" artwork and celebrates her Acoustic Album release. \n\n\nLaunched at Art Basel 2022 at the Boys Club & Lighthouse Immersion event — this NFT is redeemable for the pictured shirt. Sewn onto the shirt is an IYK NFC chip, which lets you certify both authentication and ownership upon receiving the physical shirt.\n\n\nMore info:  \n• The NFT will be redeemable starting January 2023, and ensō will handle the redemption and shipping process. International and USA shipping is free upon redemption, certain countries excluded.\n\n• The NFT will not expire, though circumstances in the future may lead to the NFT being redeemed for a similar style shirt with Mija art. \n\n• The NFT can be traded. \n\n•  Any further questions please message on Twitter @enso_collective. \n\n\nLinks:\n\nmint.madebymija.com  \n\nensocollective.xyz\n\nboysclub.vip\n\niyk.app",
