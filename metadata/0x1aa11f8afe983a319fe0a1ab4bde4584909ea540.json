    "description": "No one comes out to play anymore\nThe streets are silent, and I'm all alone\nNo laughter, no joy, just a stillness\nI wonder where all my friends have flown\n\nI used to run outside in the sun\nWith my friends, we'd laugh and play\nWe'd chase each other through the streets\nAnd have fun until the end of the day\n\nBut now, the world seems to have changed\nAnd no one wants to come out and play\nEveryone's busy with their screens\nAnd I'm left to pass the time of day\n\nI miss the sound of children's voices\nAnd the way we'd all run and shout\nI wish that things could be like before\nWhen the world was fun, and we had no doubt\n\nSo let's put down our screens for a while\nAnd go outside to play and run\nLet's make new friends and have some fun\nAnd remember that childhood is meant for fun.",
