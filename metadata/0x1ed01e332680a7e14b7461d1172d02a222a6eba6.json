    "description": "URBVN WORK$ is a collection put together over several years of doing urban photography. There's something very freeing in walking around listening to music, whilst observing and capturing the cityscape. This collection is a project showcasing Eastcamp his vision on the urban environment: the movement of people and traffic; architecture and infrastructure. Some say if you allow your mind to be dragged into a piece, you can hear the environment. The works cover places all around the world, but with Amsterdam as city to call home.",
