    "description": "\"Life is a window of vulnerability\" is about my own experience as a third culture kid. The longing for acceptance and to belong, the need for a sense of attachment for our identities, and the decades of messy process coming to terms with oneâ€™s own amorphous + multiple identities.\n\nAcknowledging the fragility and beauty of these identities that live within one physical body, but also loving that, while these personas often get into conflict with each other, they can co-exist and make peace.",
