    "description": "Good Society 001: Oshi - Know Better\n\nThis is the beginning of the Good Society series on sound.\n\nWe first want to give a massive thank you to Oshi for launching this new series with us. It means the world that we have this opportunity, as one of the first collectives on Sound, to help bridge the gap between artists and collectors. With this series, we hope to introduce and onboard many artists into the web3 space as well as simply curating incredible new music from all stars of different genres and stages of their career.\n\nIf this is your first time hearing of Good Society, we are a Los Angeles based collective who have been throwing events and releasing music over the past 4 years. We are diverse in sound and those who make up our community. Bringing people together over music is our primary purpose :)\n\nYou may expect drops from us on here weekly going forward with an emphasis on Hip Hop and Electronic music!\n\nWords from the artist:\n\n“It’s very often that people who think they know better know no better”\n\n- oshi\n",
