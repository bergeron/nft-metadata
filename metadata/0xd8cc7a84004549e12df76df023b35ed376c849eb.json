    "description": "IMAGINATION IS AN ACT OF REBELLION is a manifesto in 10 parts generated during the lockdown and gradually released on Superrare.\nThe series plays on contradictions, the most apparent characteristic of our times. Contradictions are our reality. We are contradictions. Always connected to the internet, still we never felt so disconnected. No matter the scientific advancements, our society has proved not to be able to solve the most apparent contradictions linked with its positive developments: money has not made us richer, connections have not eased depression, food engineering has not made us healthier. As young minds, we might find ourselves unable to envision the shape of our future. \n\nBut imagination can take us to new places. And finding the courage to imagine is a rebellious act. The most rebellious act. What can imagination & photography do in these times?\n\nEach of these photographs is inspired by the sentence it goes with, a sentence stemming from observation of our reality. And each photograph is produced physically, with analogue visual superimpositions, mirrors, coloured jelly and a masterful use of perspective. Pure photography, a photography that rejects manipulation rather embracing new ways of seeing, ends up in a completely digital environment, rejecting traditional spaces. Are you in for this ACT OF REBELLION? Are you in for IMAGINATION?",
