The goal with this project is to spread love and positivity to those who need it and to those who've been a ray of light to others even in the darkest of times. \n\nThe first edition is gifted to those who have made a positive impact in my life and future editions will hopefully be a ripple effect of this gesture as we continue to pay it forward. \n\n",
