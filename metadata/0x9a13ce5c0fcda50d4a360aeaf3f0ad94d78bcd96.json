    "description": "It's 3 AM and you can't sleep, you walk around your mind forest and suddenly find yourself falling into the rabbit hole of eternally looping thoughts, forgotten memories and lost dreams. \n\nYou walk around curiously, trying to make sense of all that's happening -You feel like you're going mad, Bonkers! But I'll tell you a secret, all of the best people are.\n \nInspired by the dark mushroom forest of the classical story, we take you to a forest like no other- a place inside your head. Mind forest explores your wildest thoughts, memories and dreams fused in modern elements- \n\nBe it your buzzing phone, alarm clocks, cigarette box or sleeping pills, acknowledge everything that occupies your mind, in Alice's Mind Forest.\n \nExperience the story of this artwork in VR video also!\n",
