    "description": "When I was younger. I was fortunate to have a really great friend, who owned a Neo-Geo console system. He was rich, anyone who was familiar with this gaming system, it cost $1k, and the games were a few hundred each. We played all day and night on it. It had the same graphics of an arcade machine. Neo-Geo was truly ahead of it's time.  Yes, I am an 80's baby. So Samurai showdown, and Fatal Fury were my favorites. I was always fascinated with Japanese culture, so I wanted to create something that would reflect my past.",
