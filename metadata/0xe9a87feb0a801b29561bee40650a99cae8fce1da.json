    "description": "In “Synergy With Space” the figure stands strong and patient, allowing itself to become one with their environment and in a way, themselves. This synchronization brings about change, a monumental shift in energy, and motion as the layers of the being start to move.\n\nI feel like this process of Synchronizing with our environment is an important part of the creation process. Whether this environment is the world or your home, both are important for cultivating something meaningful.",
