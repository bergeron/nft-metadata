    "name": "The Emotions of Summer",
    "description": "Cumulonimbus clouds or thunderstorm clouds　can often be seen here in Japan during summer. \nSince Japan's summer is so hot and humid, many people find this season uncomfortable. \n\nBut it is a season that carries nostalgia and \nmemories. \n\nI am sure that the uncomfortably hot and humid weather makes it easier for people to remember various events that happened in the summer. \n\nSummer brings back many memories for me, too, especially when I see those big and white summer clouds. \nIt reminds me of fun memories and sad memories, and many more. \nI sometimes get sentimental as I think of those memories because I realize that much time has already passed. \n\nI try to express these subtle emotions that aren't easy to put into words into nostalgic illustrations. \n\nI would be happy if you would look back on your past and feel that you want to cherish your time in the future.\n\n\nWork created in 2018.\n2995×1748px",
