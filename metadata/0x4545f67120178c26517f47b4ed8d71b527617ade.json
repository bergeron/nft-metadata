    "description": "We all go through this. I'm going through this, through the time we figure out where we're going and what fills our soul.\n\nThis picture was captured on my first mountain adventure, without preparation, without equipment and without guides, only with my camera, 3 friends and a desire to seek happiness.\n\nThis is what this image portrays: my beginning and the first steps looking for happiness in nature, adventure, and beauty, which without a doubt arrived, was frozen in this piece and it motivated me to keep doing what I love.",
