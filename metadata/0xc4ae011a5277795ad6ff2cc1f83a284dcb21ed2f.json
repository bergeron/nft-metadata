    "description": "28 million light years away, in the Mitram Flos Galaxy there’s an exoplanet called Lignum, inhabited by an intelligent civilization, more than any other extraterrestrial civilization. Their knowledge in art and technology would allow them to survive very dark times\n\nTo control the minds of its inhabitants, the highest priest of the planet will occasionally prohibit any musical manifestation and limit it to the upper class, who can only listen to what he allows, no creation that isn’t of his liking can be executed.\n\n4 ancient sages, hidden in different parts of the galaxy, found out about the decision of the highest priest of Lignum and decided to infiltrate the planet to recruit musicians and create new sounds.\n\nQmba is the first of 4 sages to emerge from the depths of the planet Glax, he is the initiator of the revolution in search of returning music to the inhabitants of Lignum. Qmba brings us cumbia from the future.\n\nThis is the beginning of a great musical rebellion.",
