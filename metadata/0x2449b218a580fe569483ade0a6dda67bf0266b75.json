    "description": "What could be more important than movement in all aspects of life?\nBallet is movement, plasticity, grace, and tremendous self-discipline and hard work.\nBallet is a great art form, outwardly fragile, gentle, but strong in spirit. Â I admire these people, it is the inner strength and solemnity and it can not help but inspire .\nMy studies at the Academy in the department of sacred and monumental painting influenced all my work.  My Ballerinas are painted in a unique color scheme, earthy colors combined with the glow of gold.\nI am inspired by the plasticity of the body, it is an image of a divine person in whom everything is beautiful, both physical and spiritual.\nThe art of spiritualized plasticity, a thought embodied in movement.\nNFT 6000/12000 \nArt 1200/600mm (48/24 inch)\nOil on canvas Mixed technique\nOne unique work of art 1/1\n\n",
