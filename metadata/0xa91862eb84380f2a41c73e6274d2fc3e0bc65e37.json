    "description": "A new road called NFTs opened up for me on January 11, 2021.  \nI came here with no prior knowledge of the community, web3, blockchain, or cryptocurrencies. I initially believed it would be simple to sell my artwork here, but after a short while, I learned it is a whole new world of art enthusiasts. After that, I began to learn and interact with others, which was fascinating. I met several wonderful people who love art and collect art.  \nI believe I have matured both as a person and as an artist over the past 365 days. \nNow NFTs are a part of my life, and I feel lost in this amazing universe.",
