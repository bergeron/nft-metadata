    "name": "Nine of Cups",
    "description": "The Nine of Cups is a card of plenitude, symbolizing integrity, containment, inner joy, reflected externally in the form of abundance. \nCreating this card, I navigated through magical inner worlds with a lot of joy.\nThe female figure meditating peacefully represents a healed, awakened and present self, undisturbed by the ocean waves representing the fluctuations of life. For her the waves are no longer obstacles to be transcended, they represent the “power of navigation” in both, the material world and the subtle worlds. She can already overcome any obstacle encountered because she knows how to contain herself in the perfection of the miracle of being. \nThis is a card of luck, and luck is open to each of us, without exception. \n",
