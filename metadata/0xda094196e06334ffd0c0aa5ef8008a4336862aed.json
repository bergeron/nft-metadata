    "description": "Flower 1 of 6\n\n\"Lotus Flower\" is a series of only six generative art pieces created in 2019. \n\nMusic is the core engine of these pieces; with a custom-made algorithm, the software generates these abstract shapes like flowers. The sounds contribute to deciding their colour and shape. \n\nEach artwork is 35x35cm big with a resolution of 300 DPI, perfect for high-resolution art print. ",
