    "description": "AURUM\nSebastiano Barbieri (2023)\n2160x3840 - 60fps -30sec\nPiazza Sempione, 17-23 April 2023\n\nExtended version/Full resolution video file available upon request\n\n'Aurum' explores the symbolic function of gold, together with the sculptural, architectural and decorative elements that enhance its meaning. The use of artificial intelligence to generate a surreal journey through this exploration adds a dynamic and unpredictable element to the artwork.\nThe viewing experience of Aurum is both mesmerizing and inspiring, as it combines the aesthetic appeal of gold with the intricacies of symbolism.\n\n",
