    "description": "I integrate traditional paint on canvas with digital technology to produce hybrid digital paintings. This is a repurposed high-resolution image of my own large-scale unfinished and in-process work which I re-processed with various digital tools. I added a range of new elements and enhancements which included various marks, masks and graphic overlays to the base image. \n\nThis image is prepared for high resolution display on TV monitors, digital canvases or as projections. It is a 4K resolution file measuring 3800 pixels high by 2160 pixels wide.\n",
