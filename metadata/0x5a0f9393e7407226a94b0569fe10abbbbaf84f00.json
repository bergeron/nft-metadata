    "description": "One does not simply paint a meme. Well, it turned out kinda true. This painting was a bit of a mission to finish much like the mission to find the one ring. Painted during a lockdown with a nice little curfew attached as a bonus feature to it, I love my hometown. It's becoming more like Mordor every day. Who will step up and win the 1/1 NFT? I can't lend you my axe but I can give you a limited edition to use as a weapon. One does not simply win a Nifty Royale... I bid thee good luck. - Lushsux",
