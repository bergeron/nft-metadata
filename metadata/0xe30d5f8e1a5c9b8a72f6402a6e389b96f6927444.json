As we sit and witness the outright criminal acts that are being committed by the Russian army we wanted to create a way to help those fighting to keep their freedom. Our goal: Donate the proceeds from the sale of our war stricken NFT's to Ukraine. To help support those who are willing to risk their lives to fight for the freedom of their country.",
