    "description": "001 Ice Cream Lane\n\nWelcome to ShroomVille! Here we see a few Goofs in one of their many “Habitat’s” - having fun, and making Ice Cream! Ice Cream is a STAPLE & Favorite for the Goofs, as they need massive amounts of Sugars/carb intake to keep their enormous brains going (using huge amounts of energy throughout each day!)\n\nWe even see a Fully Developed Goof! Perched Up Top! (This is the last Gestation stage of a Goof - when the brain has grown so large, & they sprout wings! There are actually 4 Total Stages, Babies, Teens, Adults, and Elders all make up the Goof Community!) \n\nMany of the areas the GooFs dwell in are lush with wildlife and plants, hence the name where the GooFs live “ShroomVille”. \n\nGooFs are highly intelligent - so they thrive with plant life, they have learned to communicate with the plants, and have symbiotic relationships with Fungi. This is actually the very FIRST RECORDED observation of GooFs in their natural environment - interacting together! Enjoy!",
