    "description": "\"You are alive.\"\n\nYour awareness of the past shouldn’t block your aliveness in the now. We all go through painful, life changing experiences. But don’t let grief be a thief of the playfulness and humour that is ever present in life. Don’t drown in your self-suffering state. Keep moving forward. Brutality is part of nature, but so is beauty. It’s up to you to keep seeing that. Your memory is a great learning mechanism of the mind. Use it to master your mood.",
