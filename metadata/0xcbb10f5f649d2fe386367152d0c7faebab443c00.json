    "description": "Diamonds are forever and SuperRaro, SuperRare Labs' genderless superhero created by the Colombian artist Camilo Restrepo, knows it.\n\nFor that reason, SuperRaro walks like a zombie haunted by the enchanting brightness of an eternal diamond, tries unsuccessfully to break them like a woodpecker and perpetually punches the gemstones like Mohammed Ali. Besides, diamonds allow our barefooted hero to eat, dance like or reincarnate pop culture characters as well as to empower the body to the limits of death.\n\nDiamonds are for everything and for everywhere: they can be attached to the neck, using a rope, in order to disappear through a black hole; play cruel and repetitive tricks or be ridden like a mechanical bull to be shaken by joy.\n\nSuperRaro wears a cape that is useless to fly, a yellow shield on the chest, and five colored karate belts just for the sake of fashion. And by living on the blockchain, this scarce super CryptoArt will last as long as its beloved precious stones that exist in the world.",
