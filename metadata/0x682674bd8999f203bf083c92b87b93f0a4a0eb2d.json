    "description": "Salisby was put into an Orangutan body for the first and the last time.  When Salisby was five years of age some invisible dark monster dead men started coming inside Salisby’s home usually after sunset.  Salisby was chased by the dark monsters inside his house at least on six different occasions.  After the dead men gave up and we’re gone, Salisby would go to his dear mother and let her know that he was being chased by dark monsters and two of the dark doctors had tried several times to poke Salisby with giant needles (syringes).  The mother did not believe her son to be sane and instead got Salisby a new teddy bear to hug and calm her son down. Eventually the dark dead men caught Salisby sleeping and managed to get Salisby the holy man procedure.   From that time forward Salisby was tormented night and day with all kinds of dark monster night mares.",
