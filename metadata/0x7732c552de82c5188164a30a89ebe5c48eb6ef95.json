    "description": "On a foggy autumn morning, I set out in search of a Full Moon composition. The moon couldn't penetrate the dense fog that I found that morning, so I pivoted and explored an area with some open fields with solitary trees. \n\nThe sun peaked behind this incredible maple and burned some orange umber into the surrounding sky, creating a magical scene. \n\nI have searched for more moments like this, but nothing has compared to this one.",
