    "description": "This was originally sold to Ismail Zaidy (@l4artiste) for 0.15ETH on Jun 26, 2022 at 1:30pm. \n\n'Flooded' is part of Portals, a series of photographs by Ismail Elaaddioui.\n\nPortals,  \nAn everlasting photo series where each photo is the embodiment of a challenge thrown at me through a phase in my life. It serves as a liberating outlook on my trials and tribulations: each portal is a documentation of my state of mind and ambushes.  \nTo step foot into each of them, I must challenge myself and question all my predispositions in order to understand myself, my shortcomings and how I can deal with them.\n\nThis project is not only a quest for me to find my true self, but also a reminder that hardships are ordinary occurrences and they’re of fleeting nature — a stepping stone to build resilience and make people less apprehensive about the future. Losing it at each impasse that comes my way is consequently futile.\n\nTo symbolize my path to self discovery, enlightenment and inner peace, I try to capture sceneries with intense beacons of light.",
