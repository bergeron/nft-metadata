    "description": "JPEG\n3000 x 2400px\n\nIntersections v.2 is an ongoing series of 1-of-1 digital reproductions of large-scale works that I have painted over the years. The works within the series rely on a system of circular geometry, meant to emphasize the similarities between form and the underlying universality within nature. The geometric linework is selectively included in the final result to add a level of abstraction.",
