    "description": "I felt a sense of tranquility looking down at New York City while flying high above in a Airbus H125 helicopter. In this particular place, even when high up in the air, you can feel the energy of the city pulsing below. With cars moving like ants along the busy streets, and people walking around like tiny dots, the urban sprawl comes alive with buzzing vibrancy. During our flight I was most struck by these giant Tetris-like buildings, with each piece fitting perfectly into place amongst the surrounding landscape. It was surreal to see such a huge metropolis from this perspective. I was humbled and felt quite small in the grand scheme of things. This image is a reminder to take a moment to change our perspective in order to see the beauty in the seemingly chaotic.",
