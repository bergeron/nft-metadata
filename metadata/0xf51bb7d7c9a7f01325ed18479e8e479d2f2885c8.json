    "description": "Most of my Northern Light photography is focused around my home region of Arctic Norway but this is far from the only place you can enjoy this phenomenon. Far away from wild fjords and rugged mountains, you can experience the Northern Lights in a completely different environment. Staggering cold. Waist deep snow. No sounds but the creaking trees. That’s the Finnish Lapland. \n\nThis shot was taken on one of the first days of 2019. The temperature was closing in on -30 degrees celsius and the skies were clear. The extreme cold and humidity caused difficulties and you could tell that the camera equipment was being pushed to the limits. \n\nWalking through this ancient, frozen forest in complete darkness is an experience hard to explain.\n\nNote: While it’s easy to expect that KP 4 Northern Lights always result in a more active or vivid display, that’s not the case when you’re as far south in Finland as where this shot was captured.",
