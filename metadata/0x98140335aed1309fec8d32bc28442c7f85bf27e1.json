    "description": "Hossein Khan House, Tabriz This house is one of the valuable buildings of Tabriz, which unfortunately has been destroyed for unknown reasons The only existing work of this building is related to the sketches that Eug√®ne Flandin drew from Tabriz in 1217 AD, coinciding with the reign of Mohammad Shah Qajar.The architectural style of the house is related to the Qajar style, with simple moccasins on the outside and tiles with yellow and orange backgrounds. 2: Considering that the houses were built in the middle of the garden and the site was around them, and considering the difference in the style of the side walls with the house itself, the side walls are probably part of the additions to the main building",
