    "description": "Wildernoord is a series of moving paintings, featuring wild patches of organic growth in the ever changing landscape of Amsterdam Noord. \n\nThese transitionary landscapes were found on the side of roads, next to large construction sites or on plots of land yet to be turned into something ‘useful’. All in a state of transition, waiting to be transformed but yet determined to grow into something rather beautiful. \n\nIn the summer of 2021, while biking from my studio, I was captivated by the dancing flowers in the wind, and filmed these ephemeral bits of wilderness that grow when life is left to its own devices, and turned them into 3 digital paintings; papaver, blauw and zweef. \n\nThe music loop is from The Chi Factory’s album ‘Travel in Peace’ released on the Astral Industries label.",
