    "description": "The Emperor has a small collection of royal boomerangs. But, being boomerangs, they're very hard to keep! As soon as one is taken, it flies right back to where it started. Your goal is to somehow hold on to a boomerang. MAKE SURE YOU TEST YOUR SOLUTION LOCALLY FIRST. Do not just call mint(), and do not try something speculative without being absolutely sure you're doing it right. Otherwise you can easily end up wasting gas on a transaction that accomplishes nothing.",
