    "description": "Christmas at the arctic is a Christmas special open edition from the \nOPI art . \n\n\" It was a cold evening in the snowy area of Rovaniemi (the place where people believe that Santa lives) , the beloved Santa Claus lit up the star on the Christmas tree near his home in the arctic. \nThe Fictional story claims that the Christmas tree is said to be the first where the star will be lit before Christmas and last to switch off after Christmas. \"\n\nA special edition from my OPI illustration where simple lines, shapes and B and W palette is used to create a complex or grandeur art.\n\nSize 3000 x 3000",
