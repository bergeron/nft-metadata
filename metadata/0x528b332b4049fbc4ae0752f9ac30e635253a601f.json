    "description": "Legend says he once was an honorary samurai, who vowed to protect his emperor and his kingdom. He was a brave warrior and had immense faith in his master. But, with time the evil in the world turned him into a Ronin.\n\nEven then after losing everything, he remained faithful to his values. To fulfill his promise of protecting the kingdom and its people for eternity, he turned himself into a mecha, filed with the fire for justice and faith. \nThey say he lurks in the shadow and prevents the kingdom he once served as a mortal.\n",
