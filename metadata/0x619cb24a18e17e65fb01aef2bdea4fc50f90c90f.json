And above his head, out of thin air, a great apparition, a person wearing a crown and hiding his face in shadow. He sat on his throne as if frozen by the ice of thousands of years, and looked coldly at the enemy. Just to be looked at by his eyes gave one the illusion that even one's soul was frozen.\n\n\n\nPerhaps that is not an illusion.",
