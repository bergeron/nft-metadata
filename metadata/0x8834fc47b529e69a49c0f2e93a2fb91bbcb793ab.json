    "description": "Have you ever been so down bad that you find yourself doing things that you'd usually think INSANE. Ignoring all the red flags, texting 4 times in a row, making a mixtape at 3am, etc. Well, I've been there and I've done that (multiple times). \n\nThis track is following a whirlwind of emotions that were felt at the beginning of most affairs. Being someone who craves steady ground and consistency, I created an illusion in my head that this specific person would be that for me. \n\nLuckily that's behind me now, hence the rear view mirror artwork.
