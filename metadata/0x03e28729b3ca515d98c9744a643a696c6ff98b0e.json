    "description": "I had a massive Pontine Hemorrhagic Stroke in June 2022 and was in a coma for two weeks. It left me paralyzed on my right side, pushing my limit to learn how to use my non-dominant hand. This is my first pixel art using my left hand, while my right hand is still learning to move, with help from my wife and my kids.\n\n\nHardware - Macintosh SE/30\n\nSoftware - Animations Toolkit 1.0.1\n\nProcess: https://twitter.com/pinot/status/1608936494970073088?s=20&t=lLAc46hUMcKaad3c88-oKA",
