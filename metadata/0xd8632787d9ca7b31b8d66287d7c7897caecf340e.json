    "description": "Do you remember the moment when you first felt space and time at your fingertips? When you first felt something bigger than you around you? Than all the people on the planet?\n\nTo stop for a moment. To freeze. To dissolve into the universe and become the size of the universe itself. And suddenly realize the infinite love and possibilities, and the infinite happiness of being. \n\nTo recognize your infinite power, and with it, to become totally vulnerable. What happened before that second does not matter, what will happen after that second is still unknown. But the whole world froze, watching the great miracle â€” the birth of the real Man and the birth of the Real in man.",
