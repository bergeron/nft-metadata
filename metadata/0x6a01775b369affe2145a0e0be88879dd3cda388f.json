    "description": "Senator Elizabeth Warren is immortalised in this NFT for her stance against the innovation and freedom DeFi and Web3 has brought to millions. “DeFi is the most dangerous part of the crypto world, this is where the regulation is effectively absent, and — no surprise — it’s where the scammers and the cheats and the swindlers mix among part-time investors and first-time crypto traders. In DeFi, someone can’t even tell if they’re dealing with a terrorist.”",
