    "description": "The first five stream of consciousness drawings (of 50) made to test Eaton’s ‘Bodies’ network, a bespoke neural network trained on his photography to translate drawings into a photographic/painterly output. Each morning, over a period of two months, a new drawing was fed into the latest iteration of the network (which was training continuously), to test what it had learned. The drawings conform to the simple requirements of the network’s inputs - black lines over a grey fill - but when ‘translated’ exhibit a rich derived aesthetic, intermittently reminiscent of Francis Bacon, distilled from tens of thousands of meticulously lit studio photographs.  \n\nEach NFT comes with the accompanying original preparatory drawing for the final output.\n",
