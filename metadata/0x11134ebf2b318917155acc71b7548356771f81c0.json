    "description": "Jars of Oddities I\n\nHippocampus (Seahorse) + Nautilidae (Nautilus) + Chamaeleonidae (Chameleon)\n\nJars of Oddities is an inquiry that looks at animal hybrids and finds the ultimate beauty in what is usually considered hideous. We look at wonders created by nature and are delighted, surprised, confused, fascinated, and at times disgusted too. This exercise tries to bring together more than one creation of nature into a morbid assemblage only to find the higher beauty of the composition. The concept tries to understand how we define beauty. Does one part of nature's creation termed \"beautiful\" still hold true if we assemble a set of these beautiful creations? Isn't beauty in theory enhanced when added over? These Jars are an ode to finding answers to these questions. The idea pays tribute to the jars of Frederic Ruysch - a Dutch anatomist and botanist remembered mainly for his methods of anatomical preservations.\n\nJars of Oddities is born out of my love for biology, symbolism, and highlighting lost stories in my native palette of gold and black.",
