    "description": "A time to reflect on the change in season and the onset of winter, the Winter Solstice is often celebrated with symbolism of fire and light, along with life, death, the rising sun, and the moon\n\nAs a landscape photographer the winter solstice brings to me the excitement of snowy mountains, exploring glaciers, skiing, mulled wine and lots of photos\n\nI felt this image embodied the winter solstice with the rising sun gently hitting the face of Mount Aspiring in New Zealand, the earths shadow providing a pastel colour palette, and the setting crescent moon",
