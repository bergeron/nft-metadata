    "name": "Piran, Slovenia",
    "description": "Piran is a picturesque medieval coastal town in Slovenia. My studio is nearby, so I'm a frequent visitor. \n\nEven though it's buzzing with tourists in the summer, it always feels calm in a way. Some locals like to say that time stops in Piran. And I've tried to capture that feeling in the animated loop.\n\nThe hills in the back are a hint at the majestic Alps, which are visible on clear days from Piran's shores.\n\nAnd the sound of the violin is a nod to Piran's renowned composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini.",
