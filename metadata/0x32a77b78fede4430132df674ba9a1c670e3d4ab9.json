    "description": "Another starry night grows old, withers away, & dies as the sun rises far East. Drowned by the dawn of overwhelming light, my eyelids peeled back as I gasp for air after another crazy dream. The waves simmer as my vision met the horizon, staring infinitely into the growing ends of our morning star. Rays clash like silent thunder rushing through low clouds in the distant view, slowing as they approach the edge of my peripheral. Another day as I prayed to the Lord when I awoke and now, I see the world is in motion.",
