    "description": "'Sundreamer' represents a bit of a rebirth for me. Going through the loss of my father this past year crushed a lot of my creative spirit. My dad was someone I could always send my demos to and he would use his keen ears to give me feedback. Part of the joy I got from making music was getting to share my work with him. Losing him took a lot out of me. \n\nEven before my dad got sick, I was on a strange trajectory with music. I was pretty caught up in trying to make music that would perform well on streaming services. Often I would optimize my songs to fit Spotify playlists so I could make a decent income. The downside of that was that I was making quite a few creative sacrifices and just wasn’t enjoying what I was making anymore. \n\nWith ‘Sundreamer’ I’m going back to my roots of making music for the joy of it. I’m in a new creative chapter now and am shedding that popularity-centric point of view. Music and creativity are so important to me that I need to let them flourish before I worry about anything else. \n\nI’m back to basics, making music that speaks to my soul.",
