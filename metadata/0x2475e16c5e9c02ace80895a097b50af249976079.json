    "description": "A Tour of Hypothetical Waterfalls is part of Remembrance of Things Future, a LACMA and Cactoid Labs initiative that engages artists working on the blockchain to reimagine the museum's encyclopedic collection. Building on the museum's ongoing experimentations with art and technology, LACMA and Cactoid Labs invited pioneering digital artists to select objects from the museum's holdings and create new digital editions inspired by a diverse selection of artworks. \nI was inspired by the series A Tour of Japanese Waterfalls by Katsushika Hokusai in the collection of LACMA. To create my series I isolated Hokusai's primary compositional elements and sought to understand their interactions. Using JavaScript and p5.js, these elements became the basis for my work. I selected one of the outputs from my algorithm for my first edition with LACMA. That output represents one of the nearly infinite possible outcomes that my code is capable of generating.â€“Monica Rizzolli \nEdition of 100",
