    "description": "You ever take shrooms or lsd? And recall the moments prior to the transition into the trip? This song is for that moment. The feeling of letting go, just before the wild ride üòÇ \n\nIt's been 4 months since my last solo Music NFT \n\nCollecting ‚ÄúOff the Shrooms‚Äù is a unique opportunity to own a piece of my journey as an artist in Web3\n\nAs a special bonus, for the first 24 hours of the minting, there will be a mint bounty!\n\nFor every 7 Mints minted within this time frame, you can claim a free hoodie worth $80, and for every 14 Mints, you can claim a hoodie and two tees worth a total of $180. \n\nDon't miss out on this amazing opportunity to not only own a piece of my art but also to claim some exclusive merch by CHiLDLiKE.\n\nJoining my community means being a part of my journey as I continue to evolve as an artist and create innovative experiences in the Web3 space. I am beyond excited to share this moment with you.\n\nWe're gonna go the moon. üåô ",
