    "description": "A little spot on the map. Kona-arka is located on the brink of the world. Right on the fringe of Bengal Bay, at the end of world. The sun here is astonishingly big and close. This milky-coral disk shoots through the horizon and gifts the world with warm glow until it crosses invisibly sky edge and becomes blindingly-golden. \n\nBefore daybreak, you take a scooter and rush along the narrow beach road, overlooking the ocean, braiding sand and salty air into the flowing hair. Minutes later you leave the scooter by the souvenir shop on the shore. You easily blend in with the vibrant crowd of tourists and pilgrims, flowing here from all across India with one goal in mind. To bow down and worship the sun, here in Konarka.\n\nOn one side you hear prayers, you see hundreds of ecstatic eyes, hands showing Namaste. On the other side you feel the cosmos of universe, in its intricate and fine flow, weaving through the golden dawn. \n\nIndia. Odisha. Konark.",
