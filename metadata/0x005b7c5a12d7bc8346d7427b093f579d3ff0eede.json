    "description": "The Owls of Bushido is a collection of 400 generative NFT’s made up of over 200 hand drawn traits. The project bridges a gap between Asian inspired art and storytelling, capturing glimpses of rich heritage and traditional culture throughout.  The core of our project’s story is strongly influenced by the idea of self-worth, determination and sacrifice. With this comes the aim to inspire our community through the stories of the Masters, where you can reflect on times in your life you’ve displayed the virtues captured in their tales.",
