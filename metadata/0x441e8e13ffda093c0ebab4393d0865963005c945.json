    "description": "Last 7 years ago, my family and I lost a little black cat named ‘KURO’. He went for walk outside the house as usual. Normally, before sun goes down he’ll come back home but not that day.  We searched for KURO everywhere and found out he’s attacked by stray dog.  It’s really a big lost for me because KURO is a part of my family.\n \nSo I decided to make the short animation ‘KURO’ that based on my true story. \n\nAt the beginning of the story, the girl wishes KURO will always stay with her and never leave her. But then ‘White Butterfly’ shows up.  People believe that it's the sign of spiritual journey  to lead you to the spirit world.\n\nThe hardest moment is the girl has to accept the truth that KURO already died. She knows that she should let KURO comes across to spirit world \n \nMaking she realises that 'Even though someone no longer exists in this world, but they’ll live in your heart forever.\n\n--\n\nDimensions: 1920 x 1080 px\nFile:  MP4\nDuration : 01:14 min\n",
