    "description": "As a digital artist I often have difficulties choosing between different edits of an artwork. Also knowing when to stop creating and editing the artwork is sometimes very hard to know.  Maybe even doubt between a black and white or a color version is a question I might ask myself.  \nThis is where changeable NFT's come in and this is my first one featuring a stunning ballerina on points in an urban environment.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will be able to choose between four different versions of the artwork.  \nVersions are: \n1 - color  \n2 - color topless \n3 - black & white \n4 - black & white topless\n\nBecause I sell the art with a commercial license (please read: https://foundation.app/@ArjenRoos/nftcl/1) the collector will be able to use, create prints and sell prints of all four different versions of this NFT.\n\n4 high res JPEG files, 4000px x 4000px. Check my website for all previews and more info;  \nhttps://www.arjenroos.com/my-first-changeable-nft-called-ballerina-triangle-4-in-1/\n\nI will be asking for a small fee to cover costs like gas to manually change the content to a different version when the collector contacts me.",
