    "description": "This piece was inspired and powered by the harmonic series: 1/n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4… into infinity, incrementally diverging at a snails pace. \n\nThink overtones in music — any frequency greater than the fundamental frequency of a sound. \n\nThis work is a visual meditation on rhythm and oscillation, imagining what sound might look like, how we might transform its frequencies, shaping them in a way that is both playful and entrancing.\n\nMade with: Touch Designer\nSize: 1080 x 1920 px\nDuration: 1min05seconds\n\nThe owner will be able to receive MP4/MOV with higher quality encoding. This is the purchase benefit  for the primary sale only.",
