    "description": "The Caterpillar Pea is a spritely and showy plant. \n\nOf the few species that can morph into a butterfly, it truly is a sight to behold when observed in the wild.  \n\nAs it matures, it begins to develop wings that allow it to fly short distances, but if they exhaust themselves the fragile petal wings will fall off and the caterpillar pea will perish. \n\nIt is important they are kept in contained environments as fledglings. \n\nWhen the caterpillar pea is ready to transform into a butterfly, it must find a mate to venture into a\nchrysalis that the male produces, that encloses both of their bodies for 30 days. \n\nThis chrysalis protects the two caterpillar peas, as they undergo their transformation to become one, eventually emerging as a beautiful butterfly that can gracefully soar, infinitely.\n\n--\n\n.jpg\n1024 x 1536",
