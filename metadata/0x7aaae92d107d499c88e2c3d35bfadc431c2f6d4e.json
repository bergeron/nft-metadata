    "description": "We are made up of 75 trillion body cells. Just one square centimeter of skin consists of 600,000 cells.\n\nEvery day thousands of cells die and are regenerated by our body. The constant cycle of cell death and cell regeneration. copy and paste\n\nDue to an inflammation of my scrotum, necrosis has formed from the pressure of sitting and lying down. For a quadriplegic who sits in a wheelchair all day, the only way to regenerate the cells is to relax in bed.\n\nThis happened to me during my winter stay in Tenerife where I was bedridden for 4 weeks.\n\nDuring this time I dealt artistically with my situation. Broken Cells was created from a photo of my necrosis using various apps on my smartphone. It is meant to represent the cycle of cell death and cell rebirth in an abstract and artistic way.\n\nSize:\n3098px x 3873px\n4.66 MB JPEG",
