    "description": "We are all but dancers to the tune of Shiva - symbol of cosmic stillness and cosmic dance at the same time.\n\nLife is a cosmic dance, \nA rhythm that weaves and sways, \nA melody that enchants and entrances, \nA symphony that plays.\n\nThe stars above, they twirl and spin, \nIn an endless celestial waltz, \nThe planets follow, in tune and in time, \nWith a grace that never halts.\n\nThe sun, it boogies and jives, \nIn a fiery, dazzling display, \nIts energy pulsing and surging, \nA beat that we can feel and obey.\n\nAnd down here on earth, we move and groove, \nIn a dance that's uniquely our own, \nWe sway and dip, we strut and twirl, \nAnd let our spirits be fully shown.\n\nLife is a cosmic dance, \nAnd we are all part of the show, \nMay we embrace the rhythm and flow, \nAnd may our souls be free to glow.",
