    "description": "Avamarie is a recording artist deeply inspired by R&B and soul music and loves writing about relationship experiences in her life. \nAvamarie released her first EP in November of 2022 and since then has been working on her next project. She channeled a very dreamy, peaceful, and soulful vibe sonically for her first project and wanted to start writing more records that came from her more firey side of her personality.\n\nPerfect Timing is about her feelings she experienced when she first met a guy in her life and how electric their connection was. She was so attracted to him for so many reasons and truly felt like she met him at the perfect time. Nothing but passion and excitement fueled her inspiration for this record. She wrote the song with producer Dave Drake and was engineered by AntonTheProducer. Avamarie is showing her confident, sexy, fiesty side with this record. And she hopes her listeners feel the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• \n",
