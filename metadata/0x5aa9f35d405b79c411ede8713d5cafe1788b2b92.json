    "description": "Sometimes in life, we can lose sight of who we truly are. We might become so consumed with the expectations and demands of others that we forget our own wants and needs. \n\nIn these moments, it can be necessary to shed some of the things that are holding us back, to let go of certain relationships, jobs, or habits, in order to rediscover our true selves.\n\nBy letting go of what no longer serves us, we create space for growth and transformation. Sometimes, we need to lose a part of ourselves to find ourselves again.\n\n---\nAI, Photo Collage & Mixed Media by Nor44",
