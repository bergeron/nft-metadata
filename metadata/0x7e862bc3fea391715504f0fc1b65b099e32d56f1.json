    "name": "Aradia: Lucifer's daughter",
    "description": "Lucifer's daughter, named Aradia, grew up in hell, the heart of which her father ruled. She was one of the most powerful creatures in hell.\n\nOne day Lucifer sent her to earth to take the soul of a man who had broken his contract with hell. She went to earth and found a man who was very rich but very unhappy. She was supposed to take his soul and return, but she could not do it because she saw how much pain this man was going through.\nAradia realized that she could not be as cruel as her father.\nShe decided not to go back to hell and stay on earth to protect this man and others from her father. She became a protector of people and in return she received something she had never felt before.\n\nLucifer sent all his servants and warriors to find her and bring her back, but it was to no avail. Aradia fought them with her power and eventually defeated them all.\n\nAradia became an example to the other demons, showing that even Lucifer's daughter could serve good.",
