    "description": "The house is situated in the Mesa de Yeguas residential complex in Anapoima, on a sloping terrain with a picturesque view of the Bogot√° River basin. The design concept revolves around a longitudinal house comprising of two interconnected bars, divided by a central wall that spans the entire project. This unique configuration not only creates distinct spaces but also serves as the main entrance, guiding visitors towards the outdoor area and the inviting pool.\n\nOne of the main focal points of the design is the seamless integration with the surrounding landscape and vegetation. The volumes of the house gracefully adapt to the natural topography, utilizing the incline to create overlapping floors. This layout ensures that every space within the house enjoys panoramic views of the stunning canyon, generating a sense of openness and connection to nature.",
