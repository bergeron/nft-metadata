    "description": "May 29th, 2018, is a day that I will never forget. This chase was the end of one of the craziest 24 hours of my life. The day before we chased this storm my mom passed away from liver failure. I was running on no sleep, but we still decided to head out to chase to get my mind off everything that was happening. We started the day off in Texas and watched this storm grow into a powerful supercell. At times we had large hail being launched all around us. The storm slowly became a sculpted mothership spinning over an open field as it crossed into Oklahoma where I captured this shot. It was that moment amongst all the chaos that I felt peace and calmness.  This is the storm that I got engaged in front of to my husband who is also a storm chaser. After a rough 24 hours I truly felt a sense of happiness. Even in all the chaos of the storm it brought me peace of mind. Storms are my escape and my therapy. ",
