    "description": "so so excited to finally be releasing my genesis drop on sound! it’s been a journey - for the world of web3 and i - but i’m glad it led to to this point where I can finally share amazing music with this sick community.\n\n“lo tengo mal” is probably one of my favorite songs i’ve done, she’s a real slapper. i wrote this song with the incredible Mark Johns and my dear friends, The Fund, who produced the track. \n\nLet me start with a little Spanish lesson, if you didn’t know, I was born and raised in Barranquilla, Colombia. I had to throw in some Spanish in the mix! the phrase “lo tengo mal” means ‘he’s down bad’. so, this song is about a dude that’s really down bad for a girl, and would do anything for her, but make it a banger.\n\ni really hope you enjoy this song as much as i do, i am truly proud of it and couldn’t be more stoked to have it as my genesis drop. thank you to everyone who’s here to support, so many more incredible tracks are coming this year, so stay connected friends! <3",
