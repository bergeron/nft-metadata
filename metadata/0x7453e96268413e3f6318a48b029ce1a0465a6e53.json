    "description": "Léon was the \"lucky loser\" of the tennis world. He couldn't win a qualifying match to save his life, but somehow always managed to sneak in as a wildcard. He had been playing since he was a kid, but his knees and back were feeling the effects of all that wear and tear. One day, Léon discovered the magical power of the flower. Suddenly, his aches and pains disappeared and he was able to sleep like a baby. With newfound energy, Léon started winning tennis matches left and right. It was like he had superpowers! He breezed through the qualifying rounds of the French Open, beating opponent after opponent. It was like he was playing on clouds or something. Finally, Léon made it to the big leagues. He was playing with the big dogs now! Despite his best efforts, Léon lost in the first round. But it didn't matter. He had accomplished something truly incredible. He had shown the world that he could overcome his obstacles, thanks to his newfound friend, Mary Jane. Maybe Léon would come back next year with a big W. Who knows? Maybe he would become the first tennis player in history to win a major tournament while high as a kite.\n\nCollect and burn your “Lucky Losers” to help Léon reach the main draw of the French Open. The more he burns, the more he earns.   \n",
