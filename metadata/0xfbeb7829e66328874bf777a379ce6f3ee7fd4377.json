    "description": "Brokenness, uncertainty, pain, disappointment, and depression have a weight that can only be understood by those who experience it. The picture above portrays a person crumbling beneath the pressures of life while dealing with mental health issues. The bokeh contour effect added to the image depicts a reality where the challenges are so overbearing that the pain still cries out even in silence and withdrawal.\n\nWe cannot avoid stress, and mental illness is commonplace in this challenging world. However, the burden is far worse when faced alone. In times like these, when the pain is unshakable, it’s essential to reach out to others. Even if you have to scream “HELP!” at the top of your lunges, do not keep it in. Your health and happiness are top priorities, and sometimes you need a helping hand to get back to your best state.",
