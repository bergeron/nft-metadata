    "description": "'The crew of Starship ERC-721 disappeared in deep space. The crew, my parents had a sense of humor and a keen sense for finding the unknown. So I had the sense that my parents were telling me that there would no longer be a crew on starship. A crew that would never come back. I couldn't bring myself to call them aliens but their disappearance would surely be mistaken for something more surspicious. A few days later, I learned that more than one of the crew was a species called the Triton.' A collection of generative artwork depicting the fate of a deep space exploration crew.",
