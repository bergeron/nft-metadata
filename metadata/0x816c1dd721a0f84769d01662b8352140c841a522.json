    "story": "At an altitude of 7491m, on the peak of a mountain in the Himalaya range, lives our Baba baby. He shunned this ancient society on a quest for the perfect world! Already a master of vedas and mantras, he discovered the magic of code! Overcoming the 404, he cracked the power of creating a community of wacky babies led by his top Devotees- who are the pillars for his vision. The talented Desi babies were purgated through the supernatural code and #BabaBOOM, even their programmed diapers couldn\\â€™t handle this powerful shiz. Here began the journey to Web3 nirvana.",
