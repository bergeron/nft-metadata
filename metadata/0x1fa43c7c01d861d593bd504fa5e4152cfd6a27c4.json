    "description": "This is Folding, the first of two digital editions, derived from a diptych by Amber Vittoria. Two hand painted pieces, speaking to the ways in which we fold and unfold into new versions of ourselves as we grow older. It aims to celebrate how we evolve into the people we are meant to become.\n\nAmber Vittoria is an artist, poet, and author working in Los Angeles, California. Through abstracted form, ribbons of color and joyous words, her work aims to represent the nuances of womanhood.\n\nFolding and Unfolding by Amber Vittoria are part of the Audio Galleries Series of Artist Editions.\n\n'Folding' is available as an open edition for all to mint from the 31st March till the 3rd April 2023. Following this, 'Unfolding' will be airdropped to those that mint 'Folding' and also hold an Audio Galleries Mint Pass. This will happen following a snapshot to be taken on the 5th April 2023 at 2pm GMT.",
