    "description": "The Bridge\nChinese ink and acrylic ink on round canvas\nCreation date: February - July 2021 \nThe NFT comes with the physical painting at 70 cm in diameter\n\nWhen I returned to the piece in July this year, I had a hard time connecting to the energy of the painting, which I started earlier in winter 2021.  The idea came to me: I would go to Lake Leman and ask for his advice. I visited Bain de Paquis at 9.30 PM. It was pitch dark. I continued my creation on the beach and allowed myself to trust and create from my sensations rather than with my mind. \n\nAs I finalised this painting the next day in daylight, the message that came to me was: water is the Bridge. It was the sea that fills up the void in our geostructure, shared by the continents where we call our country, our home. What seemingly separates us, in effect, connects us.",
