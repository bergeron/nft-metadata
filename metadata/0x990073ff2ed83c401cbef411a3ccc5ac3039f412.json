    "description": "My work is not a \"collage\", but a concept of \"Bricolage\" advocated by French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss. \"Bricolage\" means to reassemble known things together in a place that deviates from the original meaning and discover new things.\n\nThis piece is a bricolage of ballerina figures, following the imagery of Victoire de Samothrace. The fragile ballerina figure is represented in an even emptier form. Some people say that my work evokes a sense of life and death, but this work seems to be a figure of a spirit that moves between the living and the dead. It could also be called \"the spirit of the Internet world.\n\nIf you look closely, it is a collection of motifs that everyone has seen, but when it is completed, something completely different appears, which is an expression similar to the \"trompe l'oeil\" in European painting.\n\nsize:7087 X 10630 px",
