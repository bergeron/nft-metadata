    "description": "Triggles are triangles made from squiggles.\n\nI came to Farcaster deeply disliking NFTs. And now here I am creating one.\n\nFor me, a triggle is a symbol of a willingness to find out that I'm wrong. To find delight when rigid boundaries give way to wonderful wonk. To stock surprisal at the perfect sanity of what was once absurd.\n\nThere are only 210 triggles because 210 is the 21st triangular number.\n\n(Also, does anyone know how to find the area of a triggle? It's keeping me up at night.)",
