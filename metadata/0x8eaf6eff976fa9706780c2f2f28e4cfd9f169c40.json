    "description": "The image contains a sword and some arrows going through a Pangolin as he is holding a virus.  Pangolins are mammals of the order Pholidota. They have large, protective keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and toenails, covering their skin, being the only known mammals with this feature. Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and they are arguably the most trafficked mammal in the world.\n \nAlthough there are other hypothesis about how the COVID-19 started, the nucleic acid sequence of a specific receptor-binding domain of the spike protein belonging to coronaviruses taken from pangolins was found to be a 99% match with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes COVID-19 and was thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic."
