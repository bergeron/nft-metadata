Reunion dinners, fire crackers, lion dances, and family gatherings are common practice when celebrating! This illustration represents what Iâ€™ve experienced during the festivities while serving as remembrance to those who may not be home to celebrate. A token that aims to bring prosperity and peace to your wallets for years to come.",
