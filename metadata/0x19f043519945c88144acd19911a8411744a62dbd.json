    "description": "This collaboration started in July 2021.  \n  \nLong before creating the Nifty Sax Spheres I was experimenting with my saxophone sound.  \n  \nI always liked to envelop myself in a warm shower of musical vibrations.  \nI find it comforting and almost spiritual.  \n  \nThis music was a prototype for what became the 'Nifty Sax Spheres'.  \n  \nI found Komachi's art in June and I was hypnotized.\nI wanted to create something for her so I recorded this little piece of music.  \n  \nThere was a lot of back and forth and our work evolved over time.  \n\nThis is the result of a friendship between two artists.  \n  \n---\n  \n  \nNiftySax x Komachi",
