    "description": "This is the first painting of my career, in which I present a love story that ended up in failure. The main character of the story are a girl and a demon who wanted to destroy me. She wants to start a family and the demon wants to get rid of me. Our story seemed beautiful and full of goodness and starting a family. While in depth, she was full of hatred, evil and destruction. And every day I discover that she wants to harm me through her behavior, words and actions. \n",
