    "description": "The purchase of this NFT entitles you to one box of artisanal, hand dipped chocolates from Willy and Me (aka Caitlin/@faeriemom13); your chocolates will be shipped to your physical address. Willy + Me chocolates are made fresh, in small batches from delicious Belgian chocolate, organic ingredients, imaginative and delectable flavor pairings, and love. Each box contains between 12 and 16 oz of handcrafted chocolates. There are no preservatives in these chocolates so store in a cool dry place and enjoy within 2 weeks of arrival. (Some of my chocolates are made with nuts, please specify if you want a box without any nut varieties) ",
