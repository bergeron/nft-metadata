    "description": "無垢\nThere is a similarity between knowing nothing and knowing everything. Maybe that's where people feel divinity.\n\nSTATEMENT\nI was saved by art. That's why I am working to create an opportunity for myself to save someone else.\nOriginally, I started painting to save myself from being tired of living. At that time, I was only looking at the dirty side of the world.\nBut that's only one side of the world. There is a front and a back to everything, and you can't eliminate only one side. When we can accept this fact and look at the two sides of things from a bird's eye view, we may be able to escape from the samsara, the cycle of suffering.",
