    "description": "Brewed from the Psychotria viridis shrub and the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, Ayahuasca is a powerful psychedelic concoction native to the Amazon. Intense sensations of euphoria and mind-altering hallucinations cleanse the mind and soul from our trapped existence in natural consciousness. Do not travel too far down the beaten road; you may never return. Ayahuasca Anonymous is a new collection derived from the art of Psychedelics Anonymous. Although each Ayahuasca Anonymous is based off of a genesis from the original collection, the overall aesthetics have been shifted. We are not affiliated with Psychedelics Anonymous and do not own the rights to the Psychedelics Anonymous art.",
