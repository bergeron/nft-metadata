    "description": "Burn My Lonely Nights is the special story behind my journey in photography. Although this photo is up for interpretation, BMLN tells the story of all the teens fighting against mental health. It's a story of loneliness,  it's a story of hope, and it's a story of reflection. This is the story of how I used photography as an outlet to express myself.",
