    "description": "My „Belpaese“ collection is a homage to all the amazing moments which I had during my fantastic journey to this beautiful country in lockdown in 2021.\nThis collection seems to be simple but it all about the feelings. I was so much thrilled and excited to have such an opportunity to travel freely again, to see people walking around, laughing, being happy spending time together that it made me appreciate and enjoy each moment of that journey. That experience created very special memories to cherish. \n\nThis is the main work from my \"Belpaese\" collection, unique as it is so symbolic. Duomo di Milano is the centuries-long symbol of equality and humility, the street singer appears as the symbol of poverty and social gaps, BVLGARI art installation can be nothing but the symbol of luxury and the lady giving alms reminds us that there is always a place for mercy and goodwill.\n\n5300 x 3500 px | 300Dpi. \n\nFree signed fine art print upon request. \n\n10% donation to UNICEF COVID19 fund.",
