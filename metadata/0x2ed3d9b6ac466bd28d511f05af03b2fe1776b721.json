    "description": "Perfection I actually prefers the name ‘Sarah’.\n\nShe has been struggling to become a real-world object for as long as I’ve known her. She has been going through therapy, and the aforementioned desire has likely been the cause. Over the years, she has developed a certain rough texture, and she thinks it makes her look imperfect, just like all the real-world objects. Of course the texture is merely an illusion, as she’s still absolutely perfectly round. Well, at least the bloat of mishaps made her larger, and she can now float.\n\n‘Why all this nonsense? Even Pinocchio could, why can’t I become real?’, she asks. I remain silent.\n\nAll this makes her blue.",
