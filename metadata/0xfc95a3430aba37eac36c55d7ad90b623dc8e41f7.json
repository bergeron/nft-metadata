    "description": "Mieke Marple at 7 months pregnant with Trinity Porsche Marple-McClintock photographed by Liz Bretz in Los Angeles on Dec 3, 2022. Art direction by Liz Bretz and Mieke Marple. Hair and make-up by Ghost Artistry.\n\nIn our attempt for collective self-betterment is the desire to achieve a more equitable space. We look to a future where a femme's position isn't defined by patriarchal hierarchies, but instead expressed through feminine enlightenment and symbiotic connection. This enlightenment, illustrated by the flare around the third eye, releases the confines and expectations of what it is to be a woman, femme, mother, nurturer. This light, which expands into retro digital space, is framed by neon acrylic claws and deep shadows to form an image of integration. Past with future. Dark and wild with self-actualized. As we progressively move toward a Protopian Future, it is the middle path, inclusive of all illusory polarities, that we must walkâ€”or else remain forever divided.",
