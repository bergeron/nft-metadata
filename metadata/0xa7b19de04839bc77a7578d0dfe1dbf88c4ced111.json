    "description": "There are few places in the UK that make me feel like I've teleported to a coastal village in either France or Italy. This is one of them. Durdle Door (for obvious reasons), is a natural limestone arch found on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, a mecca for photographers and archaeologists who travel here from all over the world to snap photos of the impressive scenery, or undertake research due to fossil activity. Our evening was spent walking this endless stretch of coastline, stopping here for sunset to take in those rays and emerald waters. With the sun shining bright, I captured this moment as people below were enjoying their final moments of summer.",
