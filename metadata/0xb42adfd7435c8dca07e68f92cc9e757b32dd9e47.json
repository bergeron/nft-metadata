    "description": "A rare encounter in the Mediterranean Sea, planktonic octopus Argonauta argo, also called Paper Nautilus. After mating, the females of these octopuses produce a shell that is as thin as paper, called an eggcase. This shell functions as a brood chamber and buoyancy unit that allows the female to stay afloat effortlessly. Males do not have an eggcase and are 10 times smaller than females. They usually ride on jellyfish or other gelatinous animals where they cannot be spotted or attacked by fish and other predators.",
