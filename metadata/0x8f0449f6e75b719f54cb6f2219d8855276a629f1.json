    "description": "  Spring has come to 3Land World! The cherry blossom flowers are in full bloom and the grass has turned green. All 3Landers are eagerly waiting for fine, nice weather to go out and do their favorite activities. \n\n Nat-chan and Yuki-chan received an invitation to visit 3Land World from one of the friendly 3Landers who had previously met each other a few months ago. When they arrived, they were excited about the new environment, and various kinds of creatures were enjoying themselves under the cherry blossom trees. Such a peaceful spring day!\n\n3Landers Fanart by PinkuRabbit\n\n\n",
