    "description": "The Island of Circe is a mysterious island paradise, not found on any map, and impossible to find… if you want to find it. It is a place of enchantment and magic, teeming with creatures of legend and ruled by its powerful namesake, the sorceress Circe. Circe’s magical enchantments can turn rational and brave men into hideous creatures and animals whose minds fall to madness. The Island of Circe is beautiful, but dangerous, just as Circe herself.\n\nTo this very day, ships carrying innocent men run aground on the Island. Those poor souls become lost to time and humanity, left to fend off Circe and impossible to find or rescue, doomed to remain there for eternity.\n\n2023, Digital Painting by Paul Reid",
