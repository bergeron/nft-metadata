    "name": "PAHOEHOE I",
    "description": "PƒÅhoehoe is an Hawaiian word and means smooth, unbroken lava. These surface features are due to the movement of very fluid lava under a congealing surface crust. My initial inspiration came from the inside of lava lamps and the neon colors those fluids have.",
