    "description": "\"Fade” is about not letting bad memories consume you. \n\nWhether this memory is of a traumatic event or of a person who had a negative impact on you, you learn to worry less, let it go and watch it fade until it’s no more.\n\nA collaboration between a group of musicians who share a love of UK dance music, who met through their journey experimenting in web3.\n\nProduced and written by Vaarwell and Sound of Fractures\n\nMastered by Emre Ramazanoglu",
