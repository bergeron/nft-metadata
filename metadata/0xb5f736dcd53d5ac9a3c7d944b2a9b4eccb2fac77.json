    "description": "I propose to you a question: what would happen if man-made Artificial Intelligence became both sentient and completely obsessed with science fiction and fantasy?\n\nWhat if that A.I. became so superior to the human race that it was overwhelmed with boredom?\n\nThen I ask you what would happen if that AI took it upon itself to create an entirely new universe?\nA universe populated by genetically altered bunnies designed to act out the fantasy world that the AI desired.\n\nWell wonder no more my friend as I introduce you to the universe of the Star Bunnies. Meet the warriors the princesses the wise old masters and the weird alien creatures. Meet the characters that act out this god-like AIï¿½s whims while also overwhelming every neighbouring universe with their cuteness.\n\nThe Star Bunnies limited edition A.I. Designed NFT Series is here to brighten your day and to help give back to the ASPCA so that no more animals need to go through the suffering of our Star bound friends.\n\nThe Star Bunnies series are 350 unique 1-of-1 AI-designed NFT images of these bundles of cuteness.\n\nPrice 0.01 eth\n20% of both the mint and secondary sales will be going directly to the ASPCA to prevent cruelty to animals.",
