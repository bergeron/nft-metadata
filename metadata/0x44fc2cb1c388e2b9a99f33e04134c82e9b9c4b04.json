    "description": "1 of 21\nSince 2014 Ukraine has been at war. The story was repeated - Ukrainians felt the dominance of Russia again, which for many decades destroyed what they have always struggled for - their independence. As a result, the\nstate \"exploded\" a phenomenon that people called \"zhovto-blakytnyi boom\" (\"yellow-blue boom\"). The coloring of the general and private space in the colors of the national flag was a way of \"pro-tecting the attacker\".The first painted objects were bridges. They became a symbol of uni-\nty of Ukraine, seams, which did not let it plunge into pieces. But very\nquickly these colors covered all of the Ukraine: houses, yards, play-\ngrounds, trees, fences, bus stops and even garbage cans.\nToday in Ukraine there is a full-scale war with Russia. And this phenomenon takes on a new meaning.\n\n\nPart of the money from the sale will be donated to the Ukrainian army.",
