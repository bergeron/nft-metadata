The sky is shrouded in wires, that transmit all our information, all our life. There has been a decline, a catastrophe in the sky. Servers of large companies are falling. They’re falling like stars. Tech giants have enormous powers to influence people, cities, countries, but they aren’t able to control their own fall.\n//\n1/3",
