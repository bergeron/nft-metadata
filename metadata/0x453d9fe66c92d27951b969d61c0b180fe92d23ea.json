    "name": "Lotka-Volterra Attractor",
    "description": "The strange attractor appears in the Lotka-Volterra model, which is often used to\ndescribe the dynamics of ecological systems in which several species interact:\npredator-prey, host-parasite, competition, and other interspecies interactions.\nInterspecies association equations have been proposed as models by Lotka and\nVolterra in other publications.\nThe American mathematician, physical chemist, statistician and demographer Alfred\nJames Lotka studied the process of generational change, the economic and\ndemographic aspects of health care, and the evolution of life expectancy.\nVito Volterra is an Italian mathematician and physicist. After World War I, his interest\nshifted to the application of mathematical ideas to biology. The most famous result of\nthis workis the development of the Lotka-Volterra model.\nThe most common application of the model in economics is the description of\ncoincidences in stock markets, technological competition, marketing, and trade\nrelations.",
