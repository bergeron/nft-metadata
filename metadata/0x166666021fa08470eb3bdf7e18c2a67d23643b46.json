    "description": "Protecting ones peace is the  biggest challenge some of us face. You can achieve peace and still have it crumble with the slightest infraction and you'll feel like you're back at square one. Learning to protect your peace is to let the little things bounce off of you because our peace can be our shield from the cruel world. Learn to harness it, cherish it, and let it growth with you. \n",
