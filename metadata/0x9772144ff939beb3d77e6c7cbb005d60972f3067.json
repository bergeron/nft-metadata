    "description": "Plaza Mayor was once the center of Madrid. It's been a meeting place since the late 1500s, and it shows. The cobblestones are worn smooth; the pavement around the outside, cracked and stained. It was a challenge to find beauty here, and that's perhaps why it's one of my favorites. ",
