    "description": "This series is inspired by my experience of visiting New York City in August and September 2022. I fell in love with the city and the vibe of newyorkers. I’ve been cycling around Manhattan and Brooklyn, taking photos of cityscapes, enjoying the flow, overwhelmed by the inspiration. After leaving NYC I’ve started imagining glass art installations all around NYC using a combination of ai tools, overpaint and photography. First 5 artworks in this series were inspired by the lovely Central Park: I'd love to see these sculptures made of glass and gold being installed in Central Park some time in the future. The rest artworks from this series will be located on the streets of NY. Created in the USA, completed in Kyiv, Ukraine by Yura Miron.",
