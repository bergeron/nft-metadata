    "description": "Ocean Series ( Speculative Corals, Infinite loop 1/1)\n\n\nOcean Series is a speculative coral 3D simulation, designed in VR and simulated, animated and textured in Blender 3D.\n\n\nSophia Kay is a digital artist using VR and 3D simulation motion graphics as a creative medium. \nShe develops a series of underwater worlds around the coral reef ecosystem, as imagined in a speculative future. In this near future, corals are becoming rare, as a result of climate change. She is inspired by the speculative underwater species of the anthropocene becoming the chthulucene.\n\nThis is a 1/1 unique edition.\n\n\n",
