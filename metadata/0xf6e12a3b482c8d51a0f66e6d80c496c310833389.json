    "description": "The Elder of the Dark Alchemists has performed the skullish ritual on some of the Demonic Blood and mixed it with the darkest ingredients from his collection. This liquid is alive and holds the purest form of evil derived from the Demon Lord. Hold it close to your Skull Lords as it will be a crucial part of the demonic ritual that is set to take place in the Graveyard very soon.\n\nCryptoSkulls Alchemy Rules:\n\nDue to the dark magic infused into the Blood of the Demon Lord, it can only react with the most powerful of CryptoSkulls - The Skull Lords themselves.\n\nBeware, Demonic Blood will create the evil clone of your OG CryptoSkull soul and in no way change the original item.",
