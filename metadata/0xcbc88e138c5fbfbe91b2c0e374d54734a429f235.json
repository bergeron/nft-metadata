    "description": "It is said when one door closes, another opens. We tend to make plans and then life happens to us, leading us in another direction entirely.\n\nThis artwork was created when I made the difficult decision to sell my beloved, rickety old house and move closer to my doctors, family, and friends. It meant letting go of my dream of renovating the 140-year-old home in favour of living in a safe, secure environment that would better support both my physical and mental health.\n\nThe door in this artwork was photographed during this transition and represents the character this home had to offer. Cherished qualities left behind, along with memories from more than a decade, to move on to a new chapter and lease on life.",
