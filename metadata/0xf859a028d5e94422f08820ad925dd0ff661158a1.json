    "description": "The .DOGE Domain Names are TLDs based on Ethereum Blockchain which have a hard cap of 20,000 names, which means that only 20,000 domain names can exist, which are decided on first minting basis. Each name, when minted, comes with a unique Doge NFT Artwork. .DOGE domain name minters get 5% royalty on all future sales of that particular name. Each domain will be used in the future for several benefits inside the Quik Ecosystem, which includes hosting your web page on the blockchain network as well as using the name as a replacement to your long cryptocurrency wallet address. Visit quik.com for more details.",
