    "description": "This is the pioneering of the Digital asset world. Today I bring to you my first ever NFT Art produced by @Uncle_conconz on IG AKA Conor, comic book artist based out of UK. This will start the Fund for a gamer/content creator comic series. Comics should expand outside of heroes and villains and bring more stories of normal people. This is what I intend to do with this project. \n\n*First minted on OpenSea August 17 2021\n",
