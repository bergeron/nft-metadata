    "description": "This is a tune I started while staying in an Airstream trailer in the woods of central California, channeling my inner Bon Iver. I spent 5 days out there making music and hiking all day. Drank a lot of instant coffee as well.\n\nI recorded probably 30 demos in that trailer and I've been chipping away at them ever since. Whenever I get stuck or at a loss for new ideas, I crack open one of those projects and I can still feel the palpable sense of inspiration I had on that trip. \n\nThe core foundation of this song is a sample of an old song my friend and I made about 10 years ago. I used some granular synthesis to make a bed from that old track, then structured a new song around the sample. As I often do I recorded my voice then mangled it up to make some emotive vocal chops. \n\nI'm hoping this one takes you on a nice little mental trip -- you deserve it âœ¨",
