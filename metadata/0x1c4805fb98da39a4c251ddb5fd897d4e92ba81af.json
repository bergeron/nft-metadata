    "description": "For as long as I can remember I painted live models. With the beginning  of the pandemic and quarantines, all of our life underwent changes.\nI didn't see anyone and the only option I had left was to paint self portraits. But this time, staring at myself, I saw Mariam without any layers.\nLooking deep within myself, led to discovery and inner intuition and I found things in me that I was never aware of until now. The changes in my life went deeper during the pandemic period.\n\ndetails:\n3840x2559 px\n",
