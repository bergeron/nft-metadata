    "description": "I'm Aisha,\nI was raised in a home that stressed on a woman's purity & I was told to be a 'good girl'.\n\nNo one let me talk about my likes & desires.\nEspecially those of romantic or sexual ones. \nI was told “my body is my future husband's gift, \nso, losing my virginity will be like handing them\n a used, unwrapped gift.”\n \nI didn't understand this concept, i still don't. \nIt was & is important for me to understand that my body and my sexuality are a gift to myself before they can be a gift to anyone else.\n\nMy sexuality is my expression, \nmy body is my home, my comfort zone.\nIt's all I have & where my soul & I hide, \nhiding away from this world.\n\nI'm good, \nJust me,\nThis is me,\nI'll be okay. \n\n-\nOriginal Abstract & Figurative Artwork by Samosa Rani - Simran Wahan",
