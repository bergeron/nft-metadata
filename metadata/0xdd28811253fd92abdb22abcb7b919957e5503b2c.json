    "description": "It had been 10 hours since the girl sat down at her computer and logged into her favorite video game, when all of a sudden she felt her body begin to shut down. Her eyes slowly began to flutter, and her body felt limp and numb. As she tried to move, the entire room went pitch black. The moniter light no longer radiated protection over her against the darkness surrounding. The air suddenly felt cold, and beneath her felt smoother than the 100 year old wooden floorboards that usually supported her gaming addiction. She stood up and felt around. Nothing. Everything had disappeared. Suddenly a tingling sensation went through her body, and in the corner of her eye, she saw a blue light. \nAs she walked closer, the girl noticed another figure sitting by what seemed to be a vintage arcade machine. The figure was a beautiful girl with unreal holographic wings, and a halo. \nWhen she finally arrived, the angel looked up at her.\n\n\"Welcome to Disconnect.\"\n3200 x 4200 px\n300 DPI ",
