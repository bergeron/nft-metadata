    "description": "Original Artwork Vehicular Dynamics - Sixth Edition of the Universal Transmissions series remastered and animated by the Visual Alchemist Hakan Hisim.\n\nVehicular Dynamics is the study of the Apex Being, The Adam Kadmon or Undivided Man. Inspired and built upon sparks from the master Leonardo Da Vinci and Hakan's personal forays and experiences into esoteric etymology, occulted symbolism and Transdimensional Xenolinguistics\n  \nKadmon ‘Aveer Qadmon' is ‘primitive air' or Azoth. Azoth was the substance in which Prima Materia (First Matter) was formed. Adam Kadmon was a two-fold manifestation:\n\n- A divine pattern or schematic which is a ‘Light Body' of macrocosmic proportions\n\n- A formulation of that sacred patterning into a being that was supra-physical, and from which the ‘Adamic Race‘ was spawned.\n\nFrom the Azoth in which the supernal world was created, the Adam Kadmon took substance as the Cosmic Man.\n\n4096 X 3080 Pixels // 30 FPS MP4+MOV (lossless) Format // 28 Second Loop +2K version",
