    "description": "A geometric abstraction of Donald Wexler’s groundbreaking prefab steel house development in Palm Springs built in 1962. The house referenced in this work was the focal point of the international recognition of Mid-Century Modern architecture in Palm Springs, California.\n\nOne of the seven homes in the development was purchased by GQ’s long-time creative director, Jim Moore, in the early 1993. Jim fully restored the house with Wexler’s input. Jim used the location for editorial photo shoots for GQ and international brands such as Prada and Gucci soon followed attracting wide spread attention to the design aesthetic. In 1995 House & Garden featured the architecture followed by a feature in Vanity Fair in 1997. This set in motion the revival of Palm Springs as a cultural mecca for art and modernist architecture.\n\n---\n\n**Please note: There is a $3k soft-reserve to deconstruct the animated version for its composite still images.** If the soft reserve is met, the winner will be able to deconstruct the animated version in exchange for 9 still images by sending it to https://www.niftygateway.com/@popgeometry\n\n*Secondary royalties for this collection are 15%*",
