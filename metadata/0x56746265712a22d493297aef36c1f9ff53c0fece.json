Based primarily on intimate group discussions that took place at Consensus 2023, it covers a wide range of pressing issues challenging the digital assets industry. These include the newly urgent subject of regulation, the competing demands of privacy and law enforcement, the difficulty of bringing self-custody to the mainstream, the future of crypto media, and more. The discussion groups, which convened largely offstage in Austin, Texas, from April 26-28, 2023, represented a cross-section of interested parties - including developers, investors, government officials, entrepreneurs, and nonprofits.  \n\nRead more about the Consensus @ Consensus Report [here](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/consensus-at-c23/).",
