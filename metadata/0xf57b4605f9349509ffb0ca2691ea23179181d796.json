    "description": "ALAX represents a lover trying to fix her partner's soul, which is broken by this heinous world, but the cracks in her soul and mind remain visible as they're too deep to be filled, which are represented in the artwork by a snow-white fractured face surrounded by colourless flowers and ivory crystals trying to increase its beauty, but it is never enough. Why? Some things are good if they're unknown.\n\nThis artwork was inspired by AYXO's past life. AYXO tries to emotionally impact the people who view his art and hopes that they can create their own meanings from the reflections of his art.\n\nÂ©2022 AYXO\n\n(2304x2304) high res file",
