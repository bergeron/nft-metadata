    "description": "While all the Shells were still searching every corner of Elysium System for To the Next operation, trying to find E Code and join the second generation phase, an unknown source of media was secretly undergoing a self-replicating infection process.\n\nThese disc-shaped media were engraved with unreadable messages and had appeared in various places in the central zone without anyone noticing. At first, all the Shells did not think much of it, considering it just a temporary whim of the Deities.\n\nHowever, within less than seven standard days, legends about these media began to spread, and Shells started gathering, collecting, and hoarding these disc plates. Rumors about the \"calling\" of these discs also spread in the streets. Shells in the Elysium System, unusually crossing racial differences, secretly formed groups to discuss the information on the discs and try to correlate them with recent system phenomena.\n\nAt this moment, the hiding and collecting of these media seemed to be waiting for the day when their function would be revealed.",
