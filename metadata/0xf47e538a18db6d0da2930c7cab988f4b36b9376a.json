    "description": "The Orb is other worldly,  \nmysterious, and full of positive energy.\n\nThe Orb was created in a challenging pandemic year where many of us have had time to reflect on what is really important in life. Priorities and visions have changed and as we emerge in a post pandemic  \nworld, Milla Novo sees the Orb bring a positive fresh burst of energy to help us all shine and succeed.\n\nA collection of physical carpets named ‘Orb’ have been created by Milla Novo and Moooi carpets. They incorporate  \nthe knotting technique and metallic ropes from Milla Novos signature wallhangings and take inspiration  from shapes typically seen in the indigenous Mapuche culture of South America. \n\nPhysical versions of the \"Orb\" carpet can be purchased via www.millanovo.com/carpets",
