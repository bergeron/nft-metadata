    "description": "The first work in my Universe collection  is \"Way\". In this world of ours, things big and small, near and far, are all reflections of one another. I have made use of the little things of nature in order to represent the immense world. Lightness and darkness, bigness and smallness, those are the elements of contrast in my work which encapsulate a paradox.",
