    "description": "The exhibition titled \"Last Dream\" was jointly organized by rapper Wowy and artist Jiane of DWP company. Among the paintings displayed at the event, rapper Wowy introduced a work painted by artist Jiane with his own blood. Identity portraits attract attention when depicted graphically with splashes of color on tissue paper, highlighting sadness and loneliness. Artist Jiane used 250 ml of rapper Wowy's blood mixed with anticoagulant to create ink. The final stage of the painting is covered with a layer of glue for long-term preservation to avoid oxidation. Proceeds from the auction of paintings at the exhibition are used to support children with blood diseases and difficult circumstances.\nThis auction is on behalf of DWP Official at Foundation\nExhibition name: \"The Last Dream\"\nExhibition Organizers: Rapper Wowy, Artist Jiane and DWP Official\nCopyright belongs to DWP Official\nhttps://linktr.ee/dwp_official",
