    "description": "The presence of money can also help improve people's welfare in rural or remote communities. With money, they can access health services, education or other resources that are not available in their surroundings. Therefore, although it is possible to live sustainably and rely on local resources without money, the presence of money is still important in modern life. The presence of excessive materialism and greed, causes people to become obsessed with wealth and power, sacrificing the more important moral and human values in life, such as justice, equality, and compassion.",
