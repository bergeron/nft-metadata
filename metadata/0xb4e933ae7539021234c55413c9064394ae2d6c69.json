It's the trail that heals me, truly. \n\nAs my first year of minting comes to an end and I reflect on all that I've seen and learned, I think it best to come back to this place and remind myself of how far I've come. \n\nYou're receiving this token because you supported my work this year. It's my simple way of saying thanks. \n\nI hope the best for you in the new year. I hope you have a place to go to that inspires you and heals you. \n",
