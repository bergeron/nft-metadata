    "description": "A peek into the artistic oddity that is the mind of man.\n\nIn the quest of life and its meaning, man will more often than not look for a ‘way out’. A sort of ‘escape’ from all that befalls him. However, in life’s journey, the only way out is by diving in headfirst into the endless spiral within himself. Father Time is no stranger, always simultaneously behind and ahead of him. The only true guide in this path of life is wisdom & Spirit. \n\nThis piece is riddled with Latin Easter eggs- for the lovers of knowledge.\n\nA 1/1 Asher’s Palette original piece by Emediong Uko\n\nIn collaboration with @the_blackben",
