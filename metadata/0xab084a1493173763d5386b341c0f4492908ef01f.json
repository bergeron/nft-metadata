    "description": "Title: Cinquecento\nLocation: Favignana Island |  Sicily | Italy\nYear: 2022\nSize: 6285 x 6763 @ 600 DPI | 15.70 MB\n\nI have spent ten years chasing perfection, details and extreme resolution.\n\nWith this collection I want to go back to the basics of photography and appreciate it as a moment forever trapped in Polaroids.\n\nIn Mosaico, many individual stories live in frames and come together with an overall story of that precise place at that moment with a surreal visual result.",
