I feel as if I've come to a place I never thought I'd have to come to. And I don't know how I got here. It's a strange place. It's a place where a little harmless dreaming and then some sleepy, early-morning talk has led me into considerations of death and annihilation\" - Raymond Carver\n\nThe first owner will receive an exclusive white noise track + the original piece without retouching",
