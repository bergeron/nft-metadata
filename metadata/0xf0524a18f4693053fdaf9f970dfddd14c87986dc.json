Sometimes stuck in mud while love and kind-hearted give us the wings of angels that could fly like swallowtail butterflies in the sunshine.\n\n--\n\n[CYBER BUTTERFLY INTRODUCTION]\nThe inspiration for Cyber butterfly is from Shunji Iwai’s movie Swallowtail butterfly. It touched me a lot when I first saw it as a teenager.\nFor a while I suddenly remembered some touched scenes and watch this movie again.\nMemory’s amazing sometimes, it could be reminded by a small details and welling out with a lot of related things.\n\n[H264-MP4/0:22/looped/25fps/1500x2400px]\nVideo with sound\nMusic by:myuu",
