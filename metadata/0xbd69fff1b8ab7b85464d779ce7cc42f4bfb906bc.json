    "description": "A Healing Ritual, Just by cutting a golden cord we can cure some disease or problem that was created by the mind through the emotions recorded at a given moment in life.\n\nIt is about being in a state of meditation and visualizing a being, it can be a man, a woman or anything else, that is in front of you, it will represent the problem that you want to heal. There is a golden cord that joins you to this being, talk to him kindly, tell him how bad you felt and the damage he was causing you, download all the pain, you can cry if necessary, thank him for the lessons he gave you. . and experiences, tell him that you are done with him and that you are going to move on, and then when you feel that you have nothing to say anymore, proceed to cut the cord and try to separate any connection you have with this being.\n\nTo finish, place your hand over your heart and fill the space with white light and seal it, and after a deep breath, come out of the meditation feeling much better than before.",
