There isn't much to boast about, I'll tell you that much right now. Your lives are not as they should be due to lack of wisdom. I've witnessed everything, and all I see is smoke, mirrors, and humanity spitting into the wind.\"\n\n4520 x 5978 px\n\nMixed Media on Aluminum\n\nA Holographic Foil Piece by Holy Blood",
