    "description": "We are so much busy doing what we are told to do since the age we were able to walk. I just sometimes forget the main question that we as humans possess and most of us never ask, Why are we here? Is it just reproduction and death that is doomed on us? Is this the only tiny blue dot in the whole universe?\n\nI tried to portray a human in process of exploring the universe. They are afraid to step ahead into the unknown but having the surprise of what the universe holds against, is the thing that fuels them.\n\nI was actually very fascinated with Space and Cosmos as a kid and had a poster/Calender with our Solar Systems. So yesterday I woke up and looked at it, which gave me the idea for this artwork.\n\nThe video of how I made this artwork is in my Instagram.\n@visualdemon.nft\n\nCreated In Blender.",
