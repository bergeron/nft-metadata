    "description": "501 Deca Dreamers, 100% made from triangles all stitched together traveling all directions on a few Decagons to create something unique using their CC0 license. Dreamers were born from experimenting, join me, as I experiment more. Unlockable print ready files released on a monthly basis together with other extra experimental ideas to try out/make use of and feedback on these may trigger a larger collection and you have yourself a freemint ticket already by just holding a Deca Dreamer. Traits were generated and added for future use in some or other experimental way and holder participation.",
