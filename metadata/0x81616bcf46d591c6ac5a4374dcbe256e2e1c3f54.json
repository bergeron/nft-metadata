    "description": "One of my favorite photos ever taken. GG passed away February 23, 2021. I'd like to commemorate the life of this  wonderful pupper one year later with this special genesis mint on my new smart contract. GG and I had so many special memories and he always inspired me to get out and enjoy the day regardless of the weather or my current mood. No road trip too long, no day to snowy, there's always time to get out, create, and  explore. <3\n\n50% of the proceeds from this sale will benefit Paws Across Pittsburgh a 501(c) Non-profit.\nhttps://www.pawsacrosspittsburgh.com/about",
