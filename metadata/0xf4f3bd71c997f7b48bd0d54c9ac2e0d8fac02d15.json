    "description": "Up in the Sky\nI see tiny stars starting to appear\nPink, purple clouds in the Sky from there to here\nTwinkling, shining dots, but they didn't seem very clear \nStreet lights, city lights\nThe stars slowly fade and disappear\nI wish I could see them \nMaybe just for few mins or forever\n\nSo I created my night sky with stars and planets in my room\nA tiny spaceship and rocket, so I can fly to the moon\nQuick round, around the rings of Saturn\nZeep Zamp Zoom\nI see a pale blue dot, far away\nAnd a couple of Saturn moons\n\nThe Sky is full of stars and they are moving very slow\nConnecting stars and lines together, they start to glow\nIt's like those constellations that I saw in the school books\nShooting stars just flying past\nHey, Look!\n\nHey, do you see this?\nThis bright blue star in my room\nSo bright, like those circles in the Sky\nLike that orange Sun and that yellow Moon\n\nCan we get a bit closer?\nHave a look at the Bright Star \nWill play Some nice music\nAnd we can Stargaze just for few mins or forever",
