    "name": "Mariz | Elf of the Arctic Forest",
    "description": "[Story]\n  In a mysterious place, there were many beautiful glowing trees, so people named it the Arctic Forest. Unfortunately, besides the trees, no living thing could live in this forest. Except for a young elf named Mariz, a young elf born from the power of this forest. From birth until now, she did not know how long she had lived in isolation for such a long time. Until one day, a white tiger escaped the hunters who were chasing it and accidentally entered this forest. After entering, the White Tiger saw no sign of the hunter and passed out. Soon after, Mariz came by and saved the white tiger with her healing magic. Thus, the white tiger survived and inhabited this forest, but it would not be able to leave the forest either. But even so, the white tiger was willing to stay with its benefactors as long as possible.\n\nBy Kawanar",
