    "description": "A Trap Artist gets “trapped” inside a nightmare (stripped away from jewelry and fashionable sneakers), where a legion of Coconut Souls, unite, to not only terrorize him, but eventually spirit him away.\n-\nRIP TRAP is an Audio-Visual invitation to deconstruct and try to spirit away negative clichés “trapped” in the music genre; lyrical obsession with women's bodies, a reality full of gold and diamonds (allegory of “real” life in late capitalism) and formulaic beats, by an exploration of juxtaposition of conjugated shots and the idea that sound can sometimes overplay visuals.\n-\nWith an influence of early 20th century black and white cartoons (which were disturbing /unnerving and extremely surreal for kids at that time), Soviet Montage Theory and configurational soundscapes from different realms.\n\n",
