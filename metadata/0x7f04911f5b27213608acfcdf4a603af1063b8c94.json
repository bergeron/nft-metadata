    "description": "The LimeLight* suite is a stand-alone experience for translating formal, static, and tree branches into dramatic and dramatic concepts.\nAnd bringing the form and position of these trees closer to a position similar to the theater stage and its characters.\nThe lighting of this collection is without the intervention of a photographer and only by using the light sources of the trees themselves and the contrast of this\nElements are recorded with the environment in which the trees are located, such as streets, passages and parks.\n\n* LimeLight it mean, It was useful for lighting up the room, but it also performed real-time scenes with effects like sunlight. Additional lighting for general stage illumination might be provided by lights at the front of the balcony, providing an easier replacement for footlights.\n",
