    "description": "The Hales and Hunter Grainery in Riverdale IL, USA was constructed and established operations in the early 1900s. Production operations ceased half a century later and the facility sat idle, abandoned and in a state of disrepair for decades. Then in 2015 the entire complex was demolished and cleared to a barren field. Now intangible, the Grainery comes back to life in imagery and sound. Using a base image of the grainery from 2014 by TRENT NORTH, a signature animated 3D sculpture by EOIN and thematic music composed by GENZO, this 1/1 digital artwork, RISE is minted on the blockchain for future generations to enjoy. \n\nLicense: The NFT owner has unlimited right to personal use, public display and publication with credit to the creators.
