    "description": "“No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist.”\u000b― Salvador Dali (1904-1989)\n\nDalí is arguably the most famous Surrealist artist in history who explored subliminal images. He is remembered as much for his extravagant persona and iconic moustache as he is for his creative output—which spanned painting, sculpture, and product and set design, as well as film. \n",
