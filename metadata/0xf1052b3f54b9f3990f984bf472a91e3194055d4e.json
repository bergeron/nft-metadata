    "name": "André's Nike Air Force 1 Mid '07 White",
    "description": "André had a special relation with his pair of Air Force 1, bought in 2010 when he was a graphic design intern in an advertising agency. It was the first collectible sneaker he could afford. The deejay, graffiti artist and graphic designer from São Paulo, Brazil recalls it brings him good memories of the time. \"These AF1 were present at the beginning of my adult life. With them, I went to dubstep parties, street art shows and out to toy art shops.\"\n\nWhenever he went out with them, the first thing coming back home was to clean them up. Then he started to use the sneakers as a daily beater and the pride of wearing it out grew with time. \"Both for the pride of having it as well as the aesthetics. I admired the yellowish sole and the leather creases that formed along with use.\" The pair was his companion for years to the point the sole became completely smooth out with holes that started to appear. \"I gave them away along with other sneakers a few years ago but I deeply regretted it later.\"",
