    "description": "Arials series (2022). Arials offer a view from above with the feeling of suspension. The pieces represent a breakthrough toward a looser approach with freestyle drawing and movement of floating forms.  \n\nCarnival is the first piece in the series. Digital 3916 x 4000 (dpi 300). The physical 36' x 36' oil on canvas will remain in the SA collection or may separately be purchased in the future by the token holder.  A primary sale of 1.5ETH or above will include the physical.  Physicals can be redeemed via Artfora with buyer to separately cover shipping costs.",
