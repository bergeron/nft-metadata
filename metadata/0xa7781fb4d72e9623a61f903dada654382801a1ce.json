    "description": "My works in this collection- Siahmashgh- are my unlimited perception of our past, our memories and self-paintings of a portion of the ancient Middle Eastern culture which are embodied in \"The eastern Letters\", in form of bright sparkling messages from the dark heart of ages being sent                                              out to the modern world. The over displaying of the motifs and forms in this kind of art is a minor referral to the stiffness of inevitable Asian destiny which has clouded over our fate, to the extent of which it has made us too focused on our voluntary passive eternity.\ntechnique: ink & pen\n",
