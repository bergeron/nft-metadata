    "description": "\"Simp is the first single off of my first project of the year , ‘Chekhovs Gun’. This sound is quite different for me, but something I’ve been experimenting with it for a little while. A lot of the songs are recorded with all live instruments, but Simp is a little different. It still has that live feel in the verses, but in the chorus it has this kinda jersey bounce. I’m really excited for this one because it’s a real sonic journey. I’ve never heard anything like it before. \n \nI've wanted to make a song called Simp forever because the word is just so interesting to me. It has such a negative\nconnotation but truly is quite a vulnerable and loving action. To \"simp\" is to love without condition or restraint,\nno? Of course there's levels to it, can't give energy where it's not reciprocated...but I like buying my girl flowers. I like taking care of her. Let's normalize simping. Let's humanize it. It doesn't make you less of a man or woman. It takes courage to love.\"",
