    "description": "* Golden Egg holder will win a YUNICE Photo NFT valued at 0.1 ETH!\nhttps://www.curate.page/t/yunice-gallery\n\n\nSnow was written about a time when I was with someone 10 years older than me.\n\nWe never fought coz there was nothing to fight about. It felt so safe enjoying the perks of white America and emotional tranquility- the fancy dinners, concerts, and shallowness. He was freshly divorced and in my naive mind I didn't register myself as the younger, shinier, rebound. \n\nWe went to a bed and breakfast spot in upstate New York that was covered in virgin snow. There was a light indigo hue all around, as far as the eyes could see. The snow and the sky blended in, and all you could see is a small cloud of smoke coming from my breath, swirling in the air. \n\nSnow\n\nIn the woods I'm smoking\nIn a lifetime ago\nWhen the snow fall slowly in the road\nWhen your fingers fall upon my face\nWhen my smile melt slow\nWhen your love comes callin' I will go\n\nBut in your bed I sleep alone\nIn your head I dream alone\nIn your eyes I cry alone\nIn your bed I drink alone\n\nWhen your fingers fall upon my face\nWhen my smile melt slow\nWhen your love comes callin' I will go\n\nCoz in your bed I sleep alone\nIn your arms I cry alone\n\nI never been this cold\nThe wind blows straight to the bone\nAnd I hope that I was only dreaming\nBut all this time I dreamed alone\n\nWritten by Eunice Wong and Jordan Yaeger\n\n\n\n",
