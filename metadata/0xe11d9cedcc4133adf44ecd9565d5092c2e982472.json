    "description": "Portrait of an elf in a misty redwood forest. This image fulfills my desire to add an element of fantasy to my nature photography and speaks to my love of the stories in Lord of the Rings. \n\nI created the portrait of an elf using Midjourney prompts and blended her into a background photo I took of a foggy redwood forest, using Photoshop  and also did final edits to improve the AI image.\n\nI believe that AI-generated art is an exciting new tool to explore the domain of fantasy and innovation that can add another dimension to the art of photography\n\n\n\nAI Generator: Midjourney\nCreator: Kristin Piljay\nLocation of photograph: Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, CA - taken 2021\nEdition: 1/1\nYear Created: 2023\nDimensions (in pixels): 3000 x 3515",
