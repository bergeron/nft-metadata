    "description": "The PAL, or Physics Altering Lifeform, gives jump capability and a personality to spacecraft in the space MMO game Warp Nexus of the STARL Metaverse.  \r\n\r\nEach PAL possesses a unique appearance and an upgradeable and evolving persona. Possessing one entitles you to a myriad of benefits such as full access to the game forever, exclusive character and ship customizations and enhancements, and STARL Pass Point rewards.    \r\n\r\nThe PAL enables the spacecraft to traverse the Warp Nexus and instantly handles the complex navigation required to travel within the Nexus.  They are the companion and Nexus navigator, acting as the voice and personality of the ship they occupy. Their distinctive and sometimes quirky personas make them as unique and original as their biological counterparts."
