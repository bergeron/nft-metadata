    "description": "When I became a father at the age of 18, everyone around me told me that MY life would essentially be over once my child was born. The thing is, my life was far from \"over\". In fact, it was only just beginning. The only difference was that everything I'd do, from then on, would include my child. Life didn't revolve around being a parent. Life included being a parent. From the moment I opened my eyes, everything I did, I did as a father. We were joined at the hip. If I listened to music, watched TV, got dressed, went for a drive, made art... whatever I did, WE did it together and it was beautiful.",
