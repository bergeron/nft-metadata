    "description": "A manifestation of a broken mirror...\n\nThe fifth and final painting in my color story series of cream and black.  I painted this in Brooklyn Heights, as New York first began to open up after a year of pandemic disruptions.  Like New York at the time, this painting is both parts bleak and bright.  We didn't know what was ahead.  At times it felt like our luck was cursed. \n\nThis is a digital version of the physical piece. \nAcrylic on Canvas (30x30\")  \nSpring, 2021",
