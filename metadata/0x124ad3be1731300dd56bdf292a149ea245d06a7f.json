    "description": "Spring is the overexciting season when everything can change suddenly; shiny and bright clouds can turn dark and wet in seconds, as similes and dancing can turn to sadness and closeness. Sunny and blue skies can turn grey and cloudy as love can turn to hate and hate to love without control. However, changes are evolution and growth; new life shows up, bringing colours and decorating landscapes exposing nature's beautifulness to our hearts and eyes.\n\nDimensions: 10800 x 7200 pxls/40.9MB",
