    "description": "The Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. More than 500 of these mechanical beasts serve in around 25 Air forces across the world.\n\nIndian Air Force operates 12 of these flying machines. \n\nThis photograph is of an Indian Air Force's C-130J taken in my city Durgapur, West Bengal during the monsoon season of 2019. Dark clouds along with the sunset colors creates the beautiful frame. \n\nRegular training sorties by these machines are quite common here considering my city's proximity to Panagarh Air Force Base of IAF (Home base for IAF's C-130Js).\n\nZooming in the photograph clearly shows the Serial No of the aircraft in its tail fin and below the wings. \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
