    "description": "The concept of this piece is based on the pursuit of resonance. We make art. As creators we consider how we were created our selves and seek to understand the true nature of reality.  As the implementation of technology effects our daily lives,  it furthers our understanding of science , nature and spirituality.  This investigation is a journey in to outer space, beyond the gravitational pull of our home planet.  Beginning to understand how small we are. Simultaneously we are exposed to our inner galaxy and  become familiar with the connection between the internal and external self.  \nThis Logo was originality designed by Kathleen Clark for our long term Experimental Freestyle Live Music Video Project called “Martin Lucifer” and is endowed with deep meaning and powerful symbolism.  \n Here are the elements She used: Masculine represented by the symbol for Mars or Martin, the god of War,  Feminine represented by the symbol for Venus the planet of Love, beauty and art also closely associated with Lucifer.  Underneath these fundamental elements is The Sigil of Lucifer. A symbol of creation existence and power.  The Sigil also contains an “X” which symbolizes power in this physical plane. The inverted triangle is a symbol for water and the “V” at the bottom symbolizes duality. The whole symbol looks like a chalice which represents creation.  \nPrinciple Martin Lucifer Logo: Kathleen Clark   \nAI rendering: @scizors_eth  \nGenerative Synthesizer Tones: Martin Lucifer  \nOscilloscope Visuals: Raphael Wintersberger  \nVideo Edit: #PowerCycleMEWE  \n",
