    "description": "As I continue to grow on my artistic journey, one thing that continues to be the priority of everything I do is building my community. What really excites me for the future of my project is entering the Web3 world to welcome early supporters and life-long veggi fans to my community.\n\nThis song \"BROKEN RECORD\" is the focus single off the deluxe version of my last EP: PRODUCE (CHOPPED). It is a euphoric club song that I originally started working on during the writing process of the EP. Using my own vocal samples with a disco house production is a culmination of my sound you heard on the EP and where Iâ€™m heading next. \n\nThe name of my project PRODUCE serves as a double entendre. One interpretation could be in relation to the agricultural products that are associated with my artist name veggi. The other interpretation is that this project is a culmination of my current sound as a music PRODUCER.",
