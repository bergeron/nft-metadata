    "description": "I met a guy who asked me to go to Paris with him. I had only met him once, but I bought the ticket, and he booked a place for us to stay. An hour later I returned the ticket. Sometimes it's good to listen to your impulses because it makes for good art. I wrote and produced this song the next day.\n\n\nI hope you like it;) ",
