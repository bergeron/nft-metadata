    "description": "When you remove the human element you can see the raw reality. That these soulless structures and machines mean nothing. They decay over time and nature has its way to devour everything and prevail! \n\nThe train has reached its final destination. It seemed totally abandoned as I was trying to find a single soul in the station. \nIt seemed like the perfect scenery to catch this shot. The darkness and loneliness elements that are embedded in my soul, prevailed once more. \n\n\nArtist: Dimitris Fatisis\n\nEdition: Limited to 25\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.

    "Story (Hidden)": "I had to be stealthy and hide from the cameras. Stayed there until there was no one left. I had to get that shot. I’d hidden my camera in my bag and when I tried to get out of the station a security guard stopped me and interrogated me as I was the only one that was left behind. I had to act and said that I was tired and fell asleep in the station… :)",
