    "description": "Once upon a time, in a golden era of humanity, there was peace between the holy land, goblins, elves, and fantasy ancestries. All of a sudden disaster struck! Chaos and evil took over the kingdom.... During the 7th age of humanity, the horrid creatures slayed and demolished historic towns. Goblins and Elves have been raiding human settlements one by one, leaving nothing but flames in each city they come across. One kingdom still stands... the armed kingdom named the Knightscastle, they are feared amongst the evil creatures based on their history of heroic battles against the fantasy creatures. There has been chatter that the fantasy creatures are forming an alliance to battle against the KnightsCastle so they can take over the 7th age of humanity to establish the 1st age of creatures. The warriors of KnightsCastle will not simply back down from this war. Chaos will be ensued and only one will come out victorious.",
