    "description": "Poland in February 2023. My journey, or rather, evacuation from the war in Ukraine, continued in the small but beautiful city of Poznan. There is a very cozy historical center. And delicious homemade food. The Poles were very caring and friendly. It was nice to feel the warmth of communication. After all, it is so close to Ukraine, where the war is now going on. It has been almost a year since Russian troops invaded my native Ukraine. And they allow themselves to destroy everything on the way and kill everyone they meet on the way.",
