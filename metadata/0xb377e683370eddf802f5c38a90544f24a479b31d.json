    "description": "The bright lights of the floats illuminate the night, casting a dream-like glow over the lively city. Floats move down the crowded street, leaving trails of color in their wake. In the midst of \"The Festivities\" I patiently observe, experiencing the vibrant and dynamic celebration that is at the heart of this iconic event called Mardi Gras.\n\nThe Festivities is my first 1 of 1 release and marks the beginning of my journey to share my \"irl\" work with my web3 family. \n\nThe title of this piece along with the reserve price pay homage to The Memes by 6529. That is where my web3 art journey began & I'm forever thankful for that.",
