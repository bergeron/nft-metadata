    "description": "Firefly symbolism is a message that you carry a great light on the inside of you. When this spirit animal dances into your life, it reminds you to be a light to others in dark times. Seeing a firefly warns you not to burn yourself out to lighten the path of others.  \nThis spirit animal urges you to love unconditionally. Just forgive those who offend you, show gratitude, give sacrificially, and to help the needy.",
