    "description": "There are no words that can do justice to the great Andromeda Galaxy, the eternal spiral in the sky. The best word I can think of is MAJESTIC, an awe-inspiring sight. I wish I could behold it with my own eyes! But alas, the binocular logarithmic refracting telescopes built into my face are simply not sufficient. So I use a BIG telescope!\n\nThis image was created by combining hundreds of images into a 4-pane mosaic. Iâ€™ve done my best to bring out the swirling spiral arms and bright, glowing core, with the Supermassive Black Hole, Sagittarius A at its center.\n\nLike an island in the vast sea of space, Andromeda is a self-sustaining universe, home to countless celestial objects, from glowing nebulae and bright star clusters to dark, dense clouds of dust and gas.\n\nJoin me in my telescope time-machine, and enjoy Andromeda as she once was, millions of years in the past.\n\nEdition 1 of 3",
