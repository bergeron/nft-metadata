    "description": "More than ever in this chaotic environment, we all need to be influenced by what we see, hear and believe. The healing of our hearts is accessible despite everything. Let us allow ourselves to be influenced by those who have gone before us or those around us, and who have let the broken pieces of their hearts be mended like Kintsugi. So may our hearts, with their scars covered with gold, bear witness to their experiences, and mark the beginning of a new season:  beauty that rises from ashes.\n\nHigh resolution photo from physical art work:\n36,0 Mo - 5332 x 6591 px - 300 ppi - jpeg \n\nInformations about the physical art work :\n30 x 40 in - Mixed media on cherry wood panel 1 Â¼ in - 1/2 in black floating frame.",
