    "description": "With Pikes Peak hovering in the background sits a red rock natural sculpture called the Garden of the Gods. This Kissing Camels monument on top puts this registered national landmark on the map.\n\nBecause these camels are so far away, they keep their romantic activity private. But using a 600mm lens on a Nikon 850, I exposed these two stone lovers using an uncompressed raw file 45-megapixel image with 8256 x 5504 resolution. The jpeg was created from the raw digital negative, and both files will be available to the purchaser.",
