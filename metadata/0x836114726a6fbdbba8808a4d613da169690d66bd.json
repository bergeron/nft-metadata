    "description": "During Dino's latest adventure he discovered Saf, the Mystical Sword. Merging his abilities with the sword's power, Dino was able to cut into space and time. The weapon ripped the walls of his dimension, creating a huge void and portal. Dino jumped and found himself sitting next to Jaru. He noticed that both of them have become older and stronger; they've travelled through time. They were mesmerized by Ayno the one-eyed guru. Ayno is known for his ability to extract all pain and fatigue of the people that visit him. Unlocking this location will increase your time control attribute by 800 mps.",
