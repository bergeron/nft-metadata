    "description": "She holds the memory close, treasuring its delicate beauty and savouring each moment her heart glowing with love. \nShe knows that memories are like rocks in the river, eroding with the passage of time. \nThe further it goes, the softer its resonance, until even the smallest details are worn down and polished away, leaving only pure feeling behind. \nAnd yet, in quiet moments, she returns to that dreamlike landscape, where the memory of an infant's tender touch lingers like a footprint in sand.\n\n"
