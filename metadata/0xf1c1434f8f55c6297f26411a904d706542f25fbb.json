    "description": "3,000 miles or more is the genesis piece to a profoundly personal collection exploring what it means to be present while also feeling rooted somewhere else connected with your origins.\n\nThe collection offers a meditation on how we live our lives as dual beings, constantly balancing and evolving. 3,000 miles is the beginning - an embarkation point for this exploration into what it means to be \"in-between.\"\n\nCaptured at dusk in the town where my aging parents reside on the last night of a brief visit before returning to my overseas home.",
