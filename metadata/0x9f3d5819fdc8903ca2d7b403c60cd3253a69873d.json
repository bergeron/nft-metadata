    "description": "In early 2020, an explosion at the ERAL (European Radiation Accelerator Laboratory) unleashed thousands of YFUs into our Universe (which we now call our YFUverse) and opened a portal to other infinite “YFUverses”, some of which are extremely rare. It is believed that whomever owns YFU NFTs will be able to meet these fascinating, hyper-sexual creatures in their dreams, and some people say they will communicate telepathically sending constant naughty thoughts to their owners as their primary mission is to reproduce and preserve their species."
