Holders of this piece will be the first to access my new exclusive collectors-only Telegram chat, and will also be receiving personal Carpe GM shout-outs from me on Twitter for the rest of the week!\n\nPlans for subsequent drops, burns, and community-building to come. Join me.\n\n“Carpe diem! Rejoice while you are alive; enjoy the day; live life to the fullest; make the most of what you have. It is later than you think.” - Horace\n\n“GM” - web3",
