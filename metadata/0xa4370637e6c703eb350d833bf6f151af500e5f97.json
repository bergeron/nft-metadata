    "description": "In 2021 we wrote an album and filmed a documentary called, \"Islanders\". (islandersfilm.com)\n\nIn 2022 we released the album and documentary via Kamikaze Dogfight and Gravitas Ventures. We toured the music and film all over the country and capped it off with a premiere in our East Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles. Segnon pulled up. \n\nWe've admired Segnon's musicality and commitment to his craft since meeting him. He showed interest in working on something together and was in particular excited by our project, \"Islanders\". \n\nOur song \"Home\" was originally written with the intent of having a hip-hop verse. We posed the idea and Segnon jumped at it; correction, he crushed it. \n\nThe song is about constantly redefining what \"Home\" means as we navigate life and death. More specifically, it's about a soul that hasn't found a resting place.\n\n\"Home\" (Segnon Remix) is available on all streaming services and is intended to be played LOUD. ",
