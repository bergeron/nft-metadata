    "description": "Did you know that a single lightning bolt is equivalent to 300 Million Volts!!!\n\nThis massive single strike with 2 landing points surely topped the scales with its electric charge!\n\nThis bolt was one of 100s that rained down across the Desert Southwest South of Phoenix, AZ during a powerful and electric Monsoon Storm. \n\nThe flash was so bright when it occurred that it left me almost blinded by it as this struck a mile or two from my location. \n\nSun Lakes, AZ - 07/30/2022",
