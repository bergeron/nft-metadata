I wondered what if its devoid of humans, what if there is movement yet it's not visible to our naked eye, what if there is just the moment of calmness from the hustling life that's running all day, all month, all year.\n\nThis particular piece allowed me to explore one such time frame, where I find a moment of stillness in the chaos, a time that speaks to everyone who wants to just halt for a moment & say \"you are doing well do not fear your dreams, time will test have patience\".\n\nI am grateful to be blessed as an artist, able to capture these times where I am deeply connected with lives, environment and moments that are very close to me.",
