    "description": "An abstract entity travels through space, with its pulsating and mutating limbs the only sign of life. The piece presents a brief cinematic experience of flight deep into a star-field, interweaving the viewer's perspective with that of this sole traveller. \n\nThe generative algorithm, written entirely in Processing, combines phase-shifted dynamics along the ribboned arms with sweeping camera movements.\n\nMade by Siddhartha Mukherjee in April 2022.\n\n...\n\n1920x1080\n60 seconds loop",
