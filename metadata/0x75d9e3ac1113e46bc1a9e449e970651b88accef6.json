    "description": "Prometheus is best known for defying the gods by stealing fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge, and more generally, civilization. Along with the gift of fire, he taught humanity mathematics and architecture to build safe and strong towns.<br>Humans learned astronomy and navigation and soon they could sail the seas. Prometheus taught them to write and to forge metal and create things that would last for centuries. His name was ‘foresight’ and he had always known that humans would change the world, for good or for ill. His resilience in the face of oppression became a popular myth and even today Prometheus is celebrated for bringing knowledge, progress, and power to human hands.<br>Promethean fire is the desire to achieve high noble goals, aimed at the benefit of other people, through self-sacrifice. So it can be said in this collection, Murat is someone who seeks to work for the education of society and supports the creative aspirations of others.<br>Promethean fire represents the first step toward awakening a high technology society from Murat’s future community work.",
