    "description": "Year 2098 :\n\nToday embarks a decade since the Earth capitulated to its resident's atrocities. A chemical leak? No, I'd call it cleansing. Vegetations vaporized into thin air as we watched and anyone who was in contact with the open air became victims of a carnage. Damian Soter of SOTER Inc., was kind enough to provide Pneumaprimes; colossal sized livable domes where we currently reside. His team was on a search mission to find habitable exoplanets and they have come back with great news! If my sources are right, Valiants; a group of elite class forming the new government, has sanctioned the migration and cleped the planet CAERUS. \n\nJoin the journey by supporting me for creating the world of Caerus in my most ambitious short series project.\n",
