    "description": "One of the entrees in the Rik Oostenbroek's \"Self\" collaborative project.\n\nTo be able to participate in such a contest is already a blessing itself. This showed me the many possibilities that I had in mind, wondering which would be the best take on this project.\n\nThis project had over 400 artists that reimagined what \"Self\" meant to them. A true solidarity in the community by uplifting others. Looking forward to more in the future.",
