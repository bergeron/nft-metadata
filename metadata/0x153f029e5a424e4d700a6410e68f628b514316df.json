    "description": "This collection was designed to help others fully understand the trauma from being in a narcissistic relationship.  Each line represents a different form of control the abuser slowly gains over the victim.  Through deep manipulation, these lines represent what one loses in an abusive relationship with a narcissist; your independence, relationships with family and friends, money, careers, and above all your self-worth.  The control creeps in on you from all angles until your left in the middle of a situation alone and unsure of who you really are anymore.",
