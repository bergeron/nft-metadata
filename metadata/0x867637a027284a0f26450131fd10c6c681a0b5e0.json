    "description": "Pray was written towards the beginning of 2020. I remember playing my guitar one afternoon and I stumbled across the guitar melody that you hear throughout the song. I kept playing it until I found the words \"I got a problem.\" The rest of the song fell together. Usually, whenever I start writing, the song writes itself. Sometimes all it takes is a good melody that helps describe how I feel at the moment.  Within two days I wrote “Pray” which is about my conflicting feelings towards wanting to love and being obligated to love.  I wanted to write a song that was sonically darker than many of my others.  Pray is the only song from my Don't Overthink It EP that features percussion. Pray is a song that I am most proud of and I hope you love it as much as I do.",
