    "description": "I'm extremely thankful to be an American. At the same time, I'm often not proud to be an American. My new piece, FREEDUMB ISN'T FREE, explores the tensions of American identify stemming from the disconnect between Americaâ€™s stated values and the values America acts out on others around the world.\n\nFor Americans, there is a massive gap between what we hear our government say and what we watch it do - from false claims behind the Iraq War, to atrocities at Abu Ghraib, and proxy drone wars in Yemen. FREEDUMB ISN'T FREE bids us not be ignorant of the dark dissonance between the way America treats the rest of the world through its actions and the values America purports to embrace.\n\nThis is GAWD's first work on Foundation, and first release with Futura Drops. This 8-bit glitch (2000 x 2500, gif) layers verbiage, in typeface + hand-drawn lettering, against an underlay of official Presidential portraits (spanning Biden to Reagan), deconstructed and distressed. Created in Photoshop +Procreate.",
