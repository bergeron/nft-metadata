    "description": "“Hear This, Transparent” influnced by Nashville and string theory, the intersection of music + technology inspired this work. The “Ghost Ballet for the East Bank Machine Works” figures as the treble clef tunes the city of Nashville, TN. Here abstracted and representational elements hit the perfect pitch.\n\nThe artists use their original artists process in this work to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on 2D aluminum sheet metal. This mixed media work, known as Metalagram®, was created with the Schinkel's original artists process developed at the intersection of art + science, and old world skills + 21st century technology.",
