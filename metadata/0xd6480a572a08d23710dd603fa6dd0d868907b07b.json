    "description": "A room created to curb freedom, restrict movement, impede vision and mission, inner prison. \n\nThe interconnected pipe filled with various cacophony of suspicions, kept spinning and flowing non-stop as if watching every idea that bloomed. \n\nAll the dead elements seem alive to conspire to stifle imagination.\n\nBut, she is the flower, her body continues to grow squirming vigorously, her petals satisfy the desire for breakthrough, her thorns glorify the lust of resistance.\n\nThis image is 3020 x 3020 px in size, JPG format. drawn with a standard mouse cursor in photoshop, with a total of 500+ layers and took 2 months of work",
