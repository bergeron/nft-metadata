    "name": "One day a geisha ordered a painting.",
    "description": "— How much can you pay? Hessen asked.\n— How much will you ask, — the girl replied, — but I want you to work in front of me.\nHessen worked hard on the painting. When the painting was finished, he asked for the highest price ever heard of in his time.\nHe received the requested amount, and the geisha, turning to her patron, said:\n— This artist only wants money. His paintings are beautiful and his mind is low. Money corrupted him. It is impossible to show a picture painted by such a disgusting person. It's only good for one of my petticoats.\nLifting her skirt, she asked Hessen to make another drawing on the inside of the skirt.\n— How much can you pay? Hessen asked.\n— Oh, as much as you want! the girl replied.\nHessen named a fantastic price, painted the picture in the required way and left.",
