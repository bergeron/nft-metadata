    "description": "One of the first water photography images I ever captured. Located on the coast of North Carolina, the Outer Banks is a renown East coast surf spot.\n\nThis was captured in the winter - the peak surf season in the OBX. The water temperature was 33 degrees and it was freezing despite being covered head to toe in 3+mm of wetsuit.\n\n",
