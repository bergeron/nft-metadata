Digital size: 4386 x 3588 px\n\n“The first time I heard hip hop was in the 1980s.  Growing up in the UK I had never heard anything like it before.  I loved the music, the culture, the lyrics inspired me. Hip hop gave me the resilience in my own struggle to find my own identity, to overcome the things that seemed impossible at that time of my life.   When people ask why Hip Hop?  It’s all about love of the music and the respect for the pioneers of this amazing culture.  Music is like love, you don’t choose it, it chooses you.”\n",
