    "description": "This will be my first work for foundation.\n\nThe theme of my work is neutral and fantastic. The theme of my work is neutral, fantastic, and cute with a hint of venom. That's the theme I drew.\nThis girl is a clumsy girl who finds love and romance difficult and destroys the goodwill of others. She doesn't know what to do. I have such feelings.\n\nI myself find love and romance difficult, and I don't understand it. I feel that I don't know what to do. Through this child, I tried to express the feeling that this state of affairs may be making the people around me sad without their knowing it.\n\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
