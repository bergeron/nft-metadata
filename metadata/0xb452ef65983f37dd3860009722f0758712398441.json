    "description": "I invite you to celebrate 555 days of my Web3 journey.  \nDuring this time, I have created more than 100 works, and more than 60 of them have been minted.  \nI experimented with styles/materials. Experienced failures and sales euphoria. Met a lot of wonderful people.  \nAnd starting with this art, I outlined for myself a new stage, a new path, and a new chapter of my NFT journey.  \nAfter all, we have so many interesting things ahead of us!  \nLFG",
