    "name": "Last Light Edinburgh",
    "description": "Last Light Edinburgh was one of the final images taken on my summer 2021 road trip around Scotland. No trip to Scotland is complete without a wander around the beautiful and vibrant city of Edinburgh. I arrived in the early evening, just as the light started to illuminate the historic sandstone architecture of the city. I wanted to capture the essence of the city in that moment, a modern and eclectic city of movement and colour shaped by its rich and dramatic past.\n\nThe collector of this image will also receive a signed limited edition print. \n\nwww.arronbeecham.com ",
