    "description": "Melissa is a girl who always looks expressionless and cold.\nHowever, whenever she sees a cat, smile spreads across her face, making her look like a completely different person.\nThe harmony of Melissa and the warm sunlight coming from the garden makes up a beautiful scenery. \nWhy is Melissa only opening up to cats?\nPlease keep an eye on more upcoming illustrations of Melissa!\n\n3000 * 3750 pixel 300dpi\ncreated by Noname",
