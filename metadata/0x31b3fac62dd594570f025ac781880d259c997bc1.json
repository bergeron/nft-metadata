    "name": "The Norse God Loki",
    "description": "The Norse god Loki is a fiery trickster, notoriously known for his mischievous ways. Even though Loki is constantly bringing chaos to Ásgarðr he is responsible for the god’s greatest treasures. He is often seen as the “bad guy” but in truth without Loki stagnation would occur. Loki is an extremely important god; his presence is much needed. Loki will push your boundaries, lighting a fire to burn away weakness making room for growth. The trickster, the sly fox, this is Loki.",
