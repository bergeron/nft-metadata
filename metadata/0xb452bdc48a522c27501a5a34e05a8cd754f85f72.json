    "description": "\"The youth is the hope of the nation\" - Rizal\n\nBut the current situation seems to indicate that Rizal's message for now is just a question. \"Is the youth really the hope of the nation\"?\n\nRizal's \"Panata\" directs to the Filipino people, especially to our youth today, the appreciation of the country's culture, the society in which he/she was born and the family in which he/she was raised.\n\"Panata\" is a patriotic sentiment and commitment that is ready to face the challenges of times, unity in the development of every Filipino people and love for the country.\n\nPanata by jemuyii",
