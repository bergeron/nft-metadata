    "description": "Do you remember rave dance parties of the 90es? Or probably heard of it? Illegal events with hundreds and thousands of audience held at secret places like abandoned factories, unused warehouses or just forests. Places where the DJs played hardcore techno, big beat, break beat, electropunk and industrial accompanied with laser shows and VJ projections. \n\nThis collection is created to bring you to that times, to make you feel the spirit of that illegal culture without using illegal psychedelics - only electronic music by KrasotKing and video from pure math fractals by Lord Of Chaos.\n\nMusic - twitter.com/krasotking24\nVideo - twitter.com/LordChaos_\n",
