    "description": "What does our real faces look like in the exact moment we are sending an emoji?\n\nAre we really smiling?\n\nSmiling Face with Smiling Eyes is the first piece of the  Humanji collection of unique portraits that I created to make us wonder about the influence of emojis in the expression of human emotions.\n\nAll portraits are drawn using my exclusive Phone and Fingers Photorealism technique. \n\nEach emoji makeup was made respecting the shadows and imperfections of the portrait in order to look like the person painted themselves.",
