    "name": "Nature's Symphony",
    "description": "The evenings in the Himalayas are like an art fest in the sky. The mighty landscapes become an audience to the symphony created in the sky. A surreal performance by nature stealing the show. This photograph depicts nature's symphony playing with the storm and the sunlight on the two mountains that look like eyes. This photograph was captured while travelling to Leh, Ladakh, India from Srinagar. The scene was so outstanding to view from a taxi window, I feel so elated and lost. I couldn't stop the taxi as it was a ghat road section and no vehicle is allowed to stop in between. Instead of getting down I took my camera and increased it to a faster shutter speed and I noticed the river flowing in the foreground which made an S-curve, and the shadows and lights acting like musical notes which makes a complete Symphony of Nature. \n\nArtist: Arun Kumar Nalimela\nLicence: Extended Editorial\nGenre: Landscape Photography\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 4208 × 2805\nLocation: Ladakh\nCamera: Sony Alpha 7R3",
