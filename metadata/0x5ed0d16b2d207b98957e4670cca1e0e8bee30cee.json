The selenite I had drew me in like no other, and I was always fascinated by how they were formed and why. \nI thought, \"If I could shrink myself and see them larger, maybe I could discover a secret of the universe!\"\n-Now I'm older, through Flip's eyes I've found a way to bring the micro and macro together. \nThis piece is a reminder that if you dream of a world, you can create it in any way you want. \n--\n-Some of the largest crystals ever found are of selenite, the largest specimen found in the Naica Mine's Cave of the Crystals being 12 meters long and weighing 55 tons.\n- The name \"Selenite\" comes from Greek selÄ“nitÄ“s (lithos), or stone of the moon, from selÄ“nÄ“ (Moon). \n-FlipðŸ›¹ðŸ–¤",
