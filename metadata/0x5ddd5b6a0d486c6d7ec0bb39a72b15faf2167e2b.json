    "description": "Le Bird noir is an original artwork by Iskra Velitchkova. It is part of Iskra's collection of birds, one of her most recognizable works. Iskra has been exploring the anatomy of bird's shapes for the last two years. By playing and disturbing different methods Iskra builds, breaks and refines its own generative prospections to explore how sometimes, organic and natural illusions and reminiscences emerge from code by allowing humans to intervene in the process.\n\n5000x7000px, PNG.  \n2021-2023.",
