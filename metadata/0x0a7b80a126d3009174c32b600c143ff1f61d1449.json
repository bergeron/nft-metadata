    "description": "Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century. The aesthetic of steampunk often incorporates Victorian-era fashion and technology, such as clockwork gears and corsets, combined with futuristic elements like advanced steam-powered machinery. This unique blend of historical and futuristic elements creates a distinctive and imaginative style.\n\nBy Hackerman",
