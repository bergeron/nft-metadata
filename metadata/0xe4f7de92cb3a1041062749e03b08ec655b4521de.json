    "description": "Legacy is what remains when we're gone. What will be left of us after this moment in time? \"Temporal Remanence\" is an expression of a fixed yet fluid instant in time. We still have time to correct our path and become better stewards of our ecosystem. \n\nThis rare artifact captures a unique historical record for those who can uncover it. Designed to be coupled with a site specific GPS location, this NFT is reserved for a special street corner in Austin, Texas. A hidden message from a world famous artist is embedded in this piece.\n\nThis is my submission for the \"Tributary: From Daylight to Nightflight\" exhibition, an art walk along Ladybird Lake and Downtown Austin within Mixed Reality. In partnership with Illust Space, SearchLight is hosting this exhibit as part of SXSW 2022. Many artist from all over the world will attend and have their art showcased in XR all around downtown Austin.\n\nThe primary collector of this NFT is entitled to claim a Freedom Flower NFT from my genesis collection.",
