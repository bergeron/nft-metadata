    "description": "TRINITY is a piece that’s dear to my heart.\n\nIn 2016, I decided to dig into my saving and book a trip to Egypt.\nAt that time, that would have been considered a “reckless” move.\n\nTook 3 months unpaid leave and amidst the uncertainty \nbooked my flight.\nLooking back, I’m glad I did it because this trip was the genesis\nof me chasing my wildest dream, PHOTOGRAPHY.\n\nI’d seen a couple of photos of the Pyramids, and had the chance \nto tour inside but the photos I took didn’t quite work for me.\nWe hired horses to explore the desert with a friend\nand voila, there it was…….. \nA perspective that tickled my fancy.  \nA perspective of Numbers & Patterns.\n\nTHE JOURNEY TO FREEDOM\n\n\nYour horse awaits.\nJoin me on my journey to the unknown.",
