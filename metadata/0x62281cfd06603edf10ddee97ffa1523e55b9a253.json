    "description": "I BECAME INSANE WITH LONG INTERVALS OF HORRIBLE SANITY.\n\nThis photo was shot on foggy morning with temperature touching almost 3 C. I used an RGB Light app in my mobile to get an Alien look and tried to blend it with the yellow color of flowers.\n\nFun Fact: The field was having water from the last day. So it was little difficult to get in. But to get the desired composition my brother sacrificed his shoes.\n\nArtist : Adnan_Dani  \nEdition : 1\\1  \nSpecifications : 2472 x 3090\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
