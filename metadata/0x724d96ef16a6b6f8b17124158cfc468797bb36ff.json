    "description": "All the works of this collection are physical and depicted with watercolors and colored pencils. This collection shows a symbolic world in which the fox is the symbol of women and the wolf is the symbol of men, and it can be said that it is related to a period of my life and those around me. In this work, I have mentioned the father-daughter relationship. Red flower is a symbol of affection and love. I love my dad . And I think it is one of the most beautiful relationships. I miss him everywhere I go and I want him to be the first person I talk to before doing anything.\n\nWidth 1440 pixels\nHeight 2000 pixels\nSize: 2.2 MG",
