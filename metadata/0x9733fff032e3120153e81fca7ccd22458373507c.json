    "name": "Diablo",
    "description": "It all started with him. People believed that the way to rule the world was to rule the seas and oceans first. That's why they wanted the power of two beasts that were legendary with their reign in the deep waters, Megalodon and Kraken. And scientists began to work in this direction. Paleontologist Dr. Adam Crowley and his Oceanographer wife, Dr. Eve Crowley was a successful couple who broke new ground many times in their field. At the same time, they both had knowledge of genetic transmissions. Studies, research, experiments continued, everything went according to plan and the result was exactly as they wanted. They succeeded, they were a first in the world, and they made the first hybrid created by human hands. But the one thing they didn't plan on was that they wouldn't be able to control what they had created. That's how he got the name \"Diablo\".",
