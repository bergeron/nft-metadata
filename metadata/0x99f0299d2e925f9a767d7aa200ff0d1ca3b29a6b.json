    "description": "I created this painting 'Julio' in 2015 according to a photo by Anthony Asael and with his permission. \nIt was a tough and challenging year where it all started with a lot of crazy faith a few years earlier. \nMy happiest and famous painting was born of tears that dropped and mixed with the colors until the time of harvest came.\nToday I sell my original art and thousands of prints world wide.\nMy clients are wide and diverse ,from the simple people to Influencers like the Oprah Winfrey Network, Harold Perrineau ,Kirk Franklin and more...\n\nA certain percentage of sales are donated to children with disabilities.\n\nMy main goal is to be able to support these children with my art.\n\n10 percent of this NFT file sale will be donated to an organization founded by the great photographer Anthony Asael called - AIA - \"Art In All of us\"\n\n@Photo Credit - Dror Varshavski",
