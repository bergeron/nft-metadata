    "description": "A conceptual artwork that explores feelings of hopelessness and despair.\n\nA small part of being human is facing a time where you see no light- no matter what direction you look in. Sometimes, adversities like this send you into a deep downward spiral- and getting back up just gets harder the lower you descend, tiring you from within.\n\nTimes like these make me want to fade into the background and just exist, like a mushroom on the forest floor or a vine creeping up a branch, observing the world do its thing, free from human distractions. Being an invisible onlooker sounds so much more peaceful than carrying around a weight in your heart that does not seem to go away.\n\nThere is, though, a crack of light through this thick, dark wilderness. It’s really faint… but it’s there.",
