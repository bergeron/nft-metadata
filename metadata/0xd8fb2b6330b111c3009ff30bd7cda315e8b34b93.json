    "description": "Context \nThe multiple photographs that comprise \"Moon Drops\" were captured under—and inspired by—a full moon. I was drawn to the light dancing off the vegetation along a retaining wall near my home. The foliage was still laden with drops of water from a gentle rain earlier that day and created a magical scene with all the elements necessary for an enchanting composite image.\n\n \n\nTechnical\n\n“Moon Drops” consists of eight photos that have been blended into one cohesive composition. The moon is a single shot taken with a 300mm telephoto lens. The seven surrounding images consist of focus-stacked photos (20-30 photos/stack) taken with macro lenses (60mm, 105mm, and 200mm). If you look at the paths of drops, you'll notice that many of the spheres are in sharp focus, thanks to the focus-stacking technique. In total, more than 200 photos went into the making of the artwork.  \n\n \n\nAs a final touch, I applied a light blue-purple gradient to augment the sense of magic, mystery, and wonder.",
