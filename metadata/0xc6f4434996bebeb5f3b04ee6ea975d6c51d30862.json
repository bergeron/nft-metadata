    "description": "The first iteration of this piece was created in 2015 in my high school Statistics class. It was all pencil on notebook paper. My first real full blown piece. The next iteration was made in 2018, a year after I started taking art seriously as a career. For my 26th birthday, I wanted to come back to this piece and bring it to the level of artistic skill that I am at now.",
