    "description": "A of Series 00, from the Letterman Club. Born out of love for type, the project will go from A to Z, in staggered releases. Each edition is unique, some with rarer characteristics than others. Over time artist collabs for certain letters will be released and new typefaces will be introduced. Get your initial, get your handle initial, gift your dog their inital, collect both your initials or even spell your whole name...it can be whatever you want",
