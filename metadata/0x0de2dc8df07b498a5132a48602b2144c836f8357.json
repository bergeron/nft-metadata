    "description": "A father and her daughter doing homework inside the migrant camp in the city of Matamoros. Having no proper school to go to, a makeshift school was built inside the camp where volunteer teachers, some of them migrants themselves, would teach the many kids that were stranded inside the camp.\n\nBoth of them, father and daughter, intervened the black and white photo.\n\nDreams on Hold is a collaborative work with people living in a migrant camp in the city of Matamoros. I would walk around the camp and take photos in black and white and I would give them printed photos for them to intervene however they wanted.\nThe result was a series of photos with drawings, colors and text that expressed their deepest feelings.\n\nA percentage of the sales will be donated to organizations that help migrants",
