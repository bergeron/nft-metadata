    "description": "I was a bear in my dream. Well, not the big brown bear, which lives in the woods, the dangerous one, but the pink plush breed. I sank deep into the dream, suddenly I was surrounded by wild green tendrils and didn't let me go, anyway I was trying to get rid of. I felt like I'm drowning.\nEverything was like deep in the sea, but somehow different...\n\nI wonder what does it mean?\n\n\n2979x4171 px\n300 dpi",
