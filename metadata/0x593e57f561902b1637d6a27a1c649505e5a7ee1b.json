    "description": "I visited this gorgeous place for the first time in the 2019 winter.\n\nI stayed in Kuusamo, Finland with my family on our skiing holidays. Thanks to this, I had a fantastic opportunity to photograph a spot I had wanted to photograph for such a long time. And of course, I took the opportunity.\n\nMy dad and I drove to start this hike for around 40 minutes from our accommodation. Once we arrived in the parking lot, we realized this hike wouldnâ€™t be an easy one.\n\nThere were many paths but none were tracked, so we had no idea which would lead us to the spot.\n\nAll the downhills and stairs were also covered in ice which made this really dangerous. We had to be very careful.\n\nEventually, though, we made it to this spot I had wanted to see with my own eyes for such a long time.\n\nI love how this photo came out. It is one of my most popular photographs to date.",
