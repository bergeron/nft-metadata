    "description": "Watching the city through a window on a rainy day during a bus ride is how I started to create this series.\n\nThe drops are beautiful and mysterious because they hide a part of reality and allow us to imagine what is happening on the other side of the window. A silhouette , a car , light from shops , nothing is very clear, but if you let your imagination work, there are thousands of stories.\n\nThere is always a story behind the dropsÂ ",
