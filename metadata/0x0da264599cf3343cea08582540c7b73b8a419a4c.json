    "name": "Black Square",
    "description": "\"This copy of art is not genuine\" is a reference to the unlicensed Windows desktop background.\nJust one phrase turned the meaning of the black square. Formally, this is a copy of Malevich, exactly the same size as the original - 79.5x79.5. Instead of craquelure - broken pixels in the RGBW spectrum.\nHow can a copy be authentic? Where in the reality of the open media space of the digitized world is the boundary between the copy and the original, what role will blockchain play in the history of art?\nThis is a question for the Genius of the Past and a Point of No Return. Malevich hung a black square in the \"Red Corner\" - a place for icons in a Russian house - as a denial of everything that already exists in art and the proclamation of a new artistic language. He also conveyed the idea of God - \"Behold, I Make All Things New.\" Now our icon is a gadget screen, a black Absolute, a monitor desktop background in the Red Corner, the most utilitarian Superpixel.",
