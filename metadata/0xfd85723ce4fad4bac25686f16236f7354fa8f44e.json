    "description": "This one-of-a-kind piece was created on-site at the [MET-AMS](https://met-ams.xyz/) conference & exhibition on the 15th of June 2022. The painting was largely customized through input & requests from attendees, who determined what objects were included into the final work. This ‘democratic’ process of crowd composition included no less than 15 different particular objects that were added to the original painting. \n\nThe overarching theme of the artwork refers to technology embracing human negligence towards material possessions, and the Metaverse reaching out to engage.\nAfter the MET AMS event, the physical painting was subsequently donated to the [Stedelijk Museum of Schiedam](https://www.stedelijkmuseumschiedam.nl/), thereby removing it for purchase from the open market. This leaves this exclusive NFT the only remaining version for private purchase.\n\nCreated in collaboration with [Grypto](https://www.grypto.company/)",
