    "description": "This piece is inspired by my travels to the forest, nature, and the creatures that live in it.\nThe drawing is abstract and completely improvised.  \nI started with a line and made a shape then completed the shape based on my imagination and my childhood hobby. Like Pareidolia game.\n\nI scanned the physical drawing and painted it digitally.",
