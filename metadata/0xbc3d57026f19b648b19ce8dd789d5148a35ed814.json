    "description": "The aspen trees of Colorado are legendary for their splendor during the annual fall colors. I planned a camping trip to the San Juan Mountains in time with the maximum foliage color change. Unfortunately, my trip also took place during one of the driest and hottest Septembers on record. Dust from the dry ground and smoke from raging wildfires put a thick haze over the entire area. Determined to take advantage of my time, I headed into the forest. With camera and protective bear spray in hand, I ventured into the woods seeking an iconic aspen photo. Finally, after hours spent trudging up and down mountain sides, I stumbled upon what I had been seeking; I was surrounded by a sea of aspen. The immersion into the aspen was beautiful. It felt like I was standing in small world created just for me to enjoy.",
