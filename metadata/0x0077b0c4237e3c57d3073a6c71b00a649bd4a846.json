    "description": "One Last Night\n\nAbout The Project:  \nOne last night\" is  the final piece of the Night Chromatics Collection. An open edition to celebrate the sold out of the 1/1.\n\nTogether, the primary colors of light — red, green and blue — make white.  \nThe absence of light makes black.\n\nNight chromatics is about night lights, in fact night colors. A visual dialogue with some object. How we see them and how lights and colors can provide us feelings. Everyone has his way to see colors.\n\nIt’s a color study. How we paint the darkness of our towns with powerful neon colors in an urge to be seen, we use vivid light colors to call your eyes. Shops, parking, restaurant, Cab... Drawing with light or drawing with colors, photography can do both.\n\nIn the purest sense of street photography, these photos were shot handled, wandering, walking through the night, and looking for lights.\n\n\nArtist: Malaury Buis  \nMedium: Digital photography  \nEdition: Open Edition (max 2 per wallet)  \nLocation: Miami, FL\n\nLicense: \nPrimary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
