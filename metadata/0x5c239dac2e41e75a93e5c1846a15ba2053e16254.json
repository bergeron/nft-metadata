    "description": "Artist Name: Mona Biswarupa\nDescription: We have smartphones, but still, we are pressed for time. When everything can be taken care of with a gentle click, one thing is still slipping through the gaps of our fingers. It is TIME. In today's world, the best gift that one can give another person, and for that matter to oneself, is their time.\n\nOne sacred ritual for me is my morning coffee time. Those few minutes that I spend in my own company reset me when magical ideas blossom like colorful butterflies, they emerge from their cocoons and brighten up the darkest corners of my heart. \n\nThe battle between the past and the future settles down into a beautiful truce.  \nThe conflict between what, when, and how calms down into a state of tranquil peace.\n I know I have won my own battle because I am in charge of my 'NOW'.\n\nMedium: Digital Art/Animation\n\nUtilities: \n- Join CAW Pioneers Community\n- Own 1/1 CAW Pioneer Series NFT\n- Check the website for other benefits",
