    "description": "The composition aims to use optical materials and make them interact with lighting to create a harmonious blending of multiple reflective and refractive materials, resulting in a prismatic effect. Unlike other materials, optical materials with different reflective, refractive, and transmission properties react to light differently. Reflectivity defines how smooth the reflection is on the surface, Refraction defines how the light gets bent inside the surface, Transmission defines the change in color of the material when light passes through it. The materials for this composition are carefully layered in the sense that the materials with less translucency are placed on the inner layers and more translucent materials with less reflective property on the outer layers. So, when light passed through these layers and bounces back to the first layer creates a blurry reflection as a result of refraction, and reflection happened at inner levels.",
