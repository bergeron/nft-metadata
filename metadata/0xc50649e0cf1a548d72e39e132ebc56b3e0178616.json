    "description": "Being far apart from someone you care about and want to spend all the time in the world with is really difficult. Different time zones, busy schedules, so much gets in the way. And you cant even see each other in person. It really sucks. Dreams of this not being a problem one day make everything so much easier.\n\n(And for Her. If I could be there right now I would. I would be right there. I don't even think it's that far. If you want to wait a bit, not too long but just long enough, I think we can close the DistanceBetweenUs. It may seem like I'm a million miles away, but not for long.)",
