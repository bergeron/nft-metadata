    "description": "Dervish Gemmo gives us the message that true power is wisdom, with the colors orange, which means \"wisdom\" in Hinduism, and red, which means \"power\" in Hinduism.\n\nand..\n\nWearing two gold earrings in one's ear means being the only one who will continue his line in Turkish tradition. Gemmo was the last dervish painting I made in this sense.",
