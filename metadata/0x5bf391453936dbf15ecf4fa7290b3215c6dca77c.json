    "description": "<p><strong>11 Justice </strong><br /><br />Translating Justitia's sense of fairness was difficult insofar as I didn't want to constantly switch between good and bad or right and wrong. The card's meaning includes harmony, prudence, complications and a measured approach; therefore the musical path I chose combines dark elements with an ascending figure and a more light-hearted sequenced melody. The middle section switches to indistinguishable voices reflecting either court proceedings or an inner dialogue. </p><p>Justice sits on a throne holding sword and scales. Red is the prevalent colour, reflecting similar garbs of judges past and present. Don't mistake her posture as being overbearing or biased, she merely listens to all evidence patiently, forming a learned opinion based on experience and truth. </p>",
