    "description": "HER SWAN is a piece very dear to me. It is a piece depicting in my terms the way one must be delicate with themselves, and treat and talk to yourself the way you would want a dear friend to speak to you. The way she delicately lifts the swan is how delicately you must treat yourself.\nYou are precious and you are loved. This love must come from yourself first so that others will see it and act on it.\nYou can only show true love once you are able to truly show it to yourself.\n",
