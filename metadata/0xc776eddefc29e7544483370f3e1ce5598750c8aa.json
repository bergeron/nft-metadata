    "description": "The sun was high in the LA sky, a merciless spotlight in a city that couldn't stop performing. Downtown, against a wall screaming with the power of flowers, stood two guys. They had that 70s look down pat, shades on, each as cool as a cucumber in a freezer.\n\nAs the sun worked its magic, the scenery started to go haywire. The wall colors flickered a tangerine dance , glitching and shifting, bending the fabric of reality like a cheap suit. It was like walking into a dream, only you didn't need to sleep or to be drunk. More than a snapshot of time, it was a trip, a mind-bending journey through the looking glass, with glitch art at the wheel, driving them down memory lane, fast and reckless.",
