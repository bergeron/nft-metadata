    "description": "Izometria is a collection of futuristic abstract art that pushes the boundaries of perception and challenges the viewer's understanding of space and geometry. The collection features a variety of simple 3d shapes combined using a programmable script to create complicated images evoking sense of futurism. The artworks in Izometria are characterized by their bold use of color and dynamic, geometric shapes that seem to float and morph before the viewer's eyes. Many of the pieces in the collection play with the concept of dimensionality, creating the illusion of depth and movement that draws the viewer in and invites them to explore the intricate details of each piece. Throughout the collection, there is a strong emphasis on the interplay between light and darkness to emphasise the contrast. The collection was created by Web3Buildoor and can be minted here: https://generativart.xyz/",
