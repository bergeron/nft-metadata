    "description": "A false awakening is a vivid and convincing dream about awakening from sleep, while the dreamer in reality continues to sleep. It always leaves one anxious and confused, could be tormenting at times and I have always wondered if the dead are lucky they would never experience it. But what if it also happens to the dead? What if they also always have dreams about awakening from the dead but in reality they are still dead? ",
