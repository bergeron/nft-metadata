    "description": "The Wasted Koalas are a collection of 1220 absurd, wasted koalas. Sometimes they are sober but most of the time they like to have a drink or smoke. Be aware! There are some Wasted Koalas with rare character traits, keep an eye out. Since we all love Koalas we should fight to keep them with us, not only in the Metaverse! Right now Koalas are progressively losing their habitat due deforestation and bush fires caused by the ongoing climate change facing extinction as early as 2050. Therefore we strive for the conservation of the Koala and its habitat. To contribute to this we are donating a percentage of the mint revenue, as also gained royalties of 5% to collectively chosen foundations fighting for the preservation of the Koala.",
