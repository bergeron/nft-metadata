    "description": "The split up personalities that judge oneself and try to disturb your mental health. Paranoia, Anxiety and commotion. The butterfly illustrates a mind that keeps going ahead no matter what happens in one own mind. And I believe that if you have a goal you should be strong enough to move foward, no matter what is happening inside and outside.",
