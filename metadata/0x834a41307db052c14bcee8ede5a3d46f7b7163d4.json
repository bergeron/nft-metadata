    "description": "My name is Thurz and I was born and raised in Inglewood, CA. I have had a unique journey in music starting as an artist and then expanding into Artist Relations, music licensing and sync, event and festival production, technology and more. I am a hands-on learner and applied a DIY approach to the launch of my company, Party In My Living Room, which started as a house party in Inglewood. I have released music in Web2 through PIMLR and I am excited to jump into Web3 on Sound XYZ. My song Deserve was produced by DJ Khalil and Tariqbeats and features my Eastside homeboy Airplane James.\n",
