Art is powered by Midjourney, while prompts are curated by the contract owner.\n\nMoshimoshi begins with the Genesis token, an Open Edition priced at 0.02 ETH. Following the Genesis mint, I will release a series of three artworks based on a single theme every two weeks. The number of series is undetermined. For each series, one token will be exclusive Genesis holders while the remaining two will be open edition claims. Series artworks will be minting at 0.01 ETH per token.\n\n",
