    "description": "3D COMPATIBLE\n\nThe pictures tell stories, clear and abstract. Past stories, which a closer look and feel reveal deep emotions and connections between objects and human life. \n\nIt shows an enormous number of steel beams. Everything seems to be connected with each other,\neach individual bearer seems to fulfill its own task. Although time has left its mark on all these steel giants in the form of rust, the framework still stands like a rock in the surf.\n\nThe interior of the steel mill is abandoned and seems to be dead. The spectator feels a soft knocking, as if the pipes wanted to scream loudly and be brought back to life.\n\nThis work of art represents a connection to the human body, life, and the flow of life.\n\nThe viewer is encouraged to connect with this true greatness, dynamics, and his own personality.",
