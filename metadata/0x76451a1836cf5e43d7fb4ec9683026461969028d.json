    "description": "Blazeshell is a creature that roams the darkest and most dangerous corners of the dystopian country of Ruvorvia. It has a wild appearance resembling a turtle, but it is much more than an ordinary turtle. The most feared feature of Blazeshell is the backpack on its back. This backpack is like a fuel depot filled with fossil fuels. Flames erupt with every step, polluting the environment in a terrifying way and surrounding everything with a layer of toxic smoke. Blazeshell's purpose is to drive Ruvorvia into an environmental catastrophe and exacerbate the harm that humans inflict on nature.",
