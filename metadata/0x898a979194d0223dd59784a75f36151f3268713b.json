    "description": "This is an older sketch of mine I really love; I didn't really know what it was about at the time but upon reflection, for me it speaks on the unavoidable male gaze and the journey to feeling truly beautiful beyond it. This piece is my submission for ART AID, with 80% of the profits going to the Women's and Girl's Emergency Centre, an Australian organisation  that supports women and children in crisis and domestic abuse situations.",
