    "description": "Witness this story set in the 1850s. \nThe 1850s is a time of important events in history. The Great Exhibition opened in London in 1851. \nThe Great Exhibition of 1851 was the nucleus of a new type of fair, the World's Fairs (Expolar), and broke new ground in many ways. For the first time, many countries around the world participated in the exhibition with their various and unique collections and had the opportunity to introduce their own culture, resources, industry and technology, as well as having the chance to compare themselves with other countries within the framework of that period. In a sense, the Great Exhibition filled a very important gap by enabling interactions between countries for the first time and by preparing the ground for technological developments to be announced worldwide for the first time. New year and new hopes.  \nMixed Techniue. Photoshop, Illustrator Photography, and Ai",
