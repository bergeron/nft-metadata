    "description": "1/1\njpeg, 5535 x 5530 \nINFINITY LANDSCAPES\n\nThe title of this artwork ‘Brushing Away the Clouds’ refers to the tradition of Chinese painting as a self-cultivating discipline capable of brushing away the clouds of a dualistically trained mind. The technique of this work drew from the traditional method of “splash ink, spare ink”. The vibrant blue colour field was spontaneously and lavishly applied while the overlaying calligraphic strokes were made to spare paint, often using the brush load to exhaustion. \n\nThis work was hand painted on canvas 1.5m x 1.5m and translated to NFT with high resolution photography.\n",
