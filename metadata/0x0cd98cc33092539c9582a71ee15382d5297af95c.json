    "description": "[This album will render as a playable playlist inside of OpenSea! Thanks to WarpSound!]\n\nI wrote and recorded this album exactly 10 years ago! Here's what I wrote way back then:\n\n\"I love Adventure Time so much, and I really relate to the Ice King. He is my favorite character. I wanted to write some songs about him, and (as I'm writing this) it's Christmas time, and somehow that seemed like a perfect fit. I wrote these songs over the course of two weeks through my Song A Day project.\"\n\nI'm re-releasing it now as an NFT! I hope it brings you much joy this holiday season.  \n",
