    "description": "COYA 10 year anniversary \n \nThis collection exhibits the beauty of Saudi Arabian and Peruvian cultures. \n\nI began researching what I thought were two vastly contrasting cultures. On the surface the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Peru share no obvious similarities, they are on opposite sides of the world and have varied histories but the further I researched, I found they boast an elegant visual commonality. \n\nMy work is a bold yet minimalistic expression using patterns, leaves and colours from both counties. What started as a celebration of differences developed into a showcase of compatibility. \n\nTaking material and leaves from both cultures meant I could honor the importance of the Ghutra, (traditional headdress) of Arabia, the colonial patters of Peru as well as incorporating the natural elements of both cultures allowed me to create a collection of art where two cultures working in perfect balance. \n\n2119 x 3000 px",
