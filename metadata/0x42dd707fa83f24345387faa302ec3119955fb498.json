    "description": "I never went to college, and I never had a \"crazy phase,\" so I didn't try Jägermeister until this past summer. I met a guy who said he used to drink at least one large bottle of it before he went to a party. Every time, without fail. He was a rugby player, so maybe that's normal? I thought that was the craziest thing I have ever heard. I did end up drinking a bottle with him.. and it wasn't horrible tasting. I can't lie. \n\nI couldn't sleep one night a few months ago, so I got up at around 3am and I wrote this song. It might be one of the strangest on the album, but that's why I like it. It's a story of the man I fell for this summer.\n\nThis is 5/8 of my album \"when you feel like dying'. \n\nWritten, produced, and mixed by me. \n\n",
