    "description": "Bears vs Bulls is a collection of 10k with a difference! At mint you can choose a Bear or a Bull so the ratio of Bears to Bulls is up to the initial minters.\n\n There are then prize draws every week of up to 0.69 ETH for either the Bears OR the Bulls depending on the price action of ETH. Up for the week? Bulls enter! Down for the week? Bears!\n\n But watch out for the Wolves... Wolves are a rare, random drop who aren't bearish or bullish - they're just chasing profit! This means that Wolves are wildcards - they are entered into the draw every week!",
