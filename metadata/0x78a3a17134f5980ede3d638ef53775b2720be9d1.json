    "description": "\"Take My Phone\" is my second drop on Sound. Its also one of my personal favorite original songs I've ever written. \n\nProduced by: Alex Palmer & Sammy Arriaga\nWritten by: Sammy Arriaga, Aaron Scherz & Alex Palmer\n\nImagine yourself in a downtown bar surrounded by an ocean of people when you're meant to be having the night of your life but instead, you're sad, drunk and lonely. Your recent breakup turned you into someone you're not and the heartbreak has blinded you to it. \n\nThis song is from my POV, putting you in my boots during my cry for help for someone to take my phone before I send the all the texts that I most likely will regret later on.\n\nSAMMY",
