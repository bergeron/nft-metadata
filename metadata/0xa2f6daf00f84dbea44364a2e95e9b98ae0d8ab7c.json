    "description": "\"Pepe in West America'' is a meme-art collection in the novel Post-Pepography genre. This series is a meme-tribute to the groundbreaking series \"Life in West America\" by Roope Rainisto, which uses post-photography techniques to create stunning images of America. Post-Pepography takes this concept one step further by infusing Pepe into the art in a process of AI additive-prompting, blending and deconstruction in Midjourney V5.1. \n\nThe result of this process creates unique 1/1 Photo-Pepographic images, each a meme of an original Rainisto piece. Every meme is meant to capture the essence of Pepe in America, his life and his struggle to fit into the fabric of society.",
