    "description": "There is a famous latin saying ‚Äúhomo homini lupus‚Äù meaning ‚Äúman is enemy to man‚Äù. I completely disagree with this discourse. I believe we are all refuges to eachother in a world in which we are all refugees.\nI dedicate my work to whomever made us feel home and sheltered. \n\nI WISH you find your refuge and feel the joy of being refuge to someone.. ‚ô•Ô∏èüå≥",
