    "description": "The black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) is a large, long-legged, long-billed shorebird. They're very similar to bar-tailed godwits, which breed in the Arctic. Black-tailed godwits have longer legs, and bar-tailed godwits don't have striped wings. As the names suggest, the tail patterns are different, too",
