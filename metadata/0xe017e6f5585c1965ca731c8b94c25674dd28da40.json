    "description": "He takes a look in the mirror, but despite being a handsome man, he sees a monster. Embroiled in self hatred, he is isolated. He is lonely and lives a miserable existence. \n\nApproaching a breaking point, he is reminded of a quote: \n\n“If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you‘d walk right over me.” \n\nBlack tears run down his faces as his lips turn black and cracks start to form in his skin.\n\nKindness, compassion, understanding, companionship…\n\nJust Words…. foreign to him… No meaning… No goals… No dreams…\n\nJust emptiness… unable to feel joy… unable to enjoy the little things…\n\nAll the food is bland…\n\nAll games are boring…\n\nAll stories are uninteresting…\n\nWhat now? What’s there to look forward to? Where is the hope?\n\nHis light has been extinguished…\n\nHe is like a Black Hole… the center is pitch black… but at the edge is the accretion disk… on that fine line between bliss and despair he watches the others soon to meet the same fate….
