    "description": "Heal yourself, so you can heal others.\n\nThe way you have filled yourself with light,\nand the way you will amplify this beauty of souls,\nmaking this world a better place, a grass root level love, a fulfilled human experience, to be trusted and have faith in, an existence that is even more than legacy of kindness yet the one that redefines love to a level that we never have to think about anything opposite, ever.\n\nSpecial thanks to VanLyxe who helped me create this through my words. :)\n\nDimensions: 8000 x 8000\n\nArt Generation Process: AI generated through poetic verse",
