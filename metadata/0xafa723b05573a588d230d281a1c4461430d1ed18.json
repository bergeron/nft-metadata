    "description": "Psyduck should come in on weakened opponents and score KOs with its variety of coverage moves. However, Psyduck's coverage does not have enough power to outright KO opponents, nor is it bulky enough to take a hit before dealing damage. Because of this, Staryu is a better Water-type for many reasons; it is faster, carries Rapid Spin, and has better coverage options."
