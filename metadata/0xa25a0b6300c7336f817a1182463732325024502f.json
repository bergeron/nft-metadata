    "description": "​In 2016 I ​had a minor breakdown ​cuz my band got dropped from our label and I was living in ​B​ro​​oklyn and feeling sad and playing a lot of pinball at bars in ​C​arroll ​G​ardens. ​I​ decided to write some songs . This was the first one I wrote and it will always be special to me because it allowed me to be free from the last chapter of my life and believe in my music again. This drop will give​​ all holders access to my private discord where I’ll be dropping new music and getting your guys help with future endeavors.​ ​​​​\n\n ",
