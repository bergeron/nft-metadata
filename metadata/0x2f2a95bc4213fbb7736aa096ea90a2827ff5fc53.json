    "description": "one of my most open ways of expressing myself is self-portraiture. I have created over 25 works in 8 years. and each of them opens my side and puts it into a single picture.\n\nI created this portrait in 2023 (it is the last one) and reveals me as a strong, independent girl, at the same time vulnerable, tender and in need of love.\n\nThank you!",
