    "description": "The Fool symbolizes the Shin principle, the principle of uniqueness of each creation of the universe. In our world, it is impossible to create exactly the same things. There is no 100% probability in our world, and for that, the Fool's energy allows us to embody the lowest probabilities. The fool is about the true will, the true desire of a being as the one and only. ",
