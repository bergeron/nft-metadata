    "description": "A room to commemorate endless summer evenings spent by the ocean. \nThe warm, salty breeze fills you with the exact feeling you experienced the first time you smelled it as a child. The air is rich with the song of the cicadas and a pleasant moisture that wraps around your \"body\" like a thin but warm blanket. This is a beta version of course and your experience will improve over time. As for the glitch: after a few hours of glaring at the eternally setting sun, you won't even notice it anymore.",
