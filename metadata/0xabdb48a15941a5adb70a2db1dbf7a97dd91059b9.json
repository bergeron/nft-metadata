    "description": "On a cold night in Southern Alberta, I got word last minute that there was going to be northern light activity. Taking all my camera gear, I got dressed and headed out north in a rush hoping that I would see them. Just in the nick of time, I got my camera set up and the lights began to dance! \n\nTo experience the Northern Lights is something magical and unforgettable. There has never been one light show that looks like another, they are all unique and special. To my surprise when I captured this image, I had no idea just what I got. After I got home and started I saw them, the eyes! The eyes of Lady Aurora from a night I will never forget, the activity was off the charts! To have captured such a moment in just a split second, there will never be another image like this ever! \n\nThis is truly a rare piece of art, and one I hold with great pride. I hope you find the beauty in this like I do. And if you haven't experienced the Aurora Borealis, you have yet to experience a wonder of the universe and something you will never forget, I promise.",
