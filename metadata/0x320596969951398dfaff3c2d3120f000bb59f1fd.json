    "description": "A painting called depicting a moment where I was still finding my way with a technique I was still developing. The creation of this piece came with frustration, an overall feeling of rustiness, and even excitement. The main subject of the piece is a familiar character, who I hadnâ€™t named publicly at the time. A character who mirrors and image of myself you could say. A character battling with an internal struggle, even though he is blessed with a gift. A gift that some dark forces hope to exploit.",
