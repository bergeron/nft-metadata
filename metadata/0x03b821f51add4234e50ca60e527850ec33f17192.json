    "description": "Hey guys it’s SLOE JACK. I’m beyond excited to be back on Sound to premiere my upcoming track, “SLOW DOWN”. It is one of the 4 new singles on my debut project, ‘BACKSTAB’.\n\n“SLOW DOWN” is about having big dreams in a room full of doubters. As someone who grew up in a small country town, I quickly learned that the people I surround myself with will determine my future. This song talks about the judgement that surrounded me before I moved to the city and the importance of self belief. \n\nThis is the focus track off my debut EP ‘BACKSTAB’. \n\n‘BACKSTAB’ dives into the events of my abusive upbringing and my life-long battle with trauma and self sabotage. It dissects the moment in my life where I reject happiness and stability in pursuit of chaos. This project was very therapeutic to write!\n\nFinally, I’d like to thank everyone at Sound for welcoming me back on their platform. I am so thankful for the opportunity!\n\n -Sloe\n",
