    "description": "Night Patrol is inspired by the dark, mystic and gloomy night scene of Gotham city streets. Shot in the streets of Toronto, the setting and composition perfectly presented itself. With the police car and puddle building reflection in frame along with the combined elements of rain and fog captures the atmosphere of a typical night in the streets of Gotham. \n",
