    "description": "\"Lily\" is a personal poetic reflection on the ongoing neverending metamorphosis of augmented aesthetics and the role of AI-collaborative art as a challenger.\n\nBlending different techniques with some more traditional, and some being the result of a succession of AI-driven tools, \"Lily\" is looking into the future with hope, curiosity, and an open-mind. \n\nSomething we all need at a time where a rift grows between traditional and AI-assisted artists while we all thrive for the same rewarding soul-searching experience.\n\nBio: Henry cannot help but think his persona as an artist must either be his biggest scam to date, or his very greatest “tour de force” as they say where he came from. Conceiving his art through cutting-edge artificial intelligence-driven tools imagined and built by people much smarter then he is, Henry quickly figured out letting machines do all the work and a sharp sense of sarcasm would be his best chance at pretending he actually belongs to the international art scene.",
