    "description": "John George Terry was previously the captain of Chelsea, the England national team and Aston Villa. Regarded as one of the best defenders in the world at his peak, he is considered to be one of the greatest central defenders of his generation, as well as one of the best English and Premier League defenders ever.\n\nTerry is the most successful captain in Chelsea's history and furthermore the most decorated Captain since the English Premier League began to this day winning a record five Premier League titles as Captain. During his 19 years with the club, he led them to five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League and one UEFA Europa League title.\n\nThis trophy room is made with love by isoroom to honour the great contribution and success of John Terry. The cabinets display Terry’s five Premier League titles, five FA Cups, three League Cups, two Community Shields and one UEFA Europa League title. The one UEFA Champions League title is displayed on the table in the centre of the room.",
