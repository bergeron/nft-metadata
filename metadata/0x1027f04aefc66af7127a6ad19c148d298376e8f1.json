    "description": "Mansell wore this race suit during one of the most iconic overtakes in Formula 1 history: chasing down teammate Nelson Piquet at the 1987 British Grand Prix while desperately trying to close down a 29 second deficit with just 28 laps to go. When Mansell finally made his move it was to feint to the left, and, once Piquet took the bait, he swept past him on the right inside to claim the lead and the victory.",
