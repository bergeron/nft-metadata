    "description": "**Crack the Sky**\n\nThe conditions this day were unlike anything I'd ever seen; cloud inversion and incredible pink & blue hues in every direction.  It wasn't this brilliant on the drive up, however. The drive up was pouring rain with no signs of a clearing as far as the eye could see. We took shelter inside of the observation center and watched a short film about the history of this location before embarking on our 3 hour drive back home.\n\nWalking back to the car, I noticed a crack in the sky with shades of blue starting to appear. Call it a hunch, but I decided to stick around and start hiking the trail to get to a better vantage point. \nThat's when the sky exploded, forming this perfect natural frame of clouds accented with colors I'd only seen in my dreams.\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite shots.  \nIt’s a once in a lifetime shot but I don’t want to limit this to one owner. I feel like it’s a way to crack into the hearts of my friends and peers, just like the sky cracked open and into my heart.\n\nThat’s why I’ve decided to turn this into an edition of 111 rather than a 1/1.",
