The brain trait serves as a statistical representation of the number of people who may have that specific mental disorder. The more common the disorder, the more common the trait exists in the collection. Unofficially Diagnosed holders can participate in raffles, community giveaways, and more. A percentage of profits will go towards nominated go-fund me's for those who have suffered as a result, direct or indirectly of a mental illness. The collection exists to not only raise awareness but also help those in need. Find out more at www.unofficiallydiagnosed.com",
