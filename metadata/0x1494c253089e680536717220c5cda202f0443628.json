    "description": "Every human faces times when they want to achieve or create something, but it feels like they canâ€™t burst through and get there. This image depicts that block while representing my process for beating it. 1) See yourself as the hero, capable of achieving/conquering. 2) See yourself on the other side of the barrier. 3) Now that you see yourself already doing it, stop thinking about it so much and push your way through. Just get going and do the work.\n",
