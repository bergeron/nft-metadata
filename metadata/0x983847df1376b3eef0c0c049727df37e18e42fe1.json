    "description": "In the 60s, Leo Castelli made posters for all his artists shows. The artists would sign a stack, and Castelli would sell them for $10-$50 each to help cover office expenses. \n\nToday, those posters have a tradable value all their own. \n\nAs a token of my gratitude, you now have my first 'poster' following my acceptance to @SuperRare\n\nI wanted to commemorate the moment, and share it with some of you who helped me get here today! \n\nThank you so much. \n\nC",
