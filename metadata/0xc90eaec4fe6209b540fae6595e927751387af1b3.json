    "description": "In Shiloh and the Spirit Realm, we see how web3 technology can be used to create new and innovative forms of storytelling. The story follows our protagonist, Shiloh, who discovers a mysterious mask and, upon wearing it, is transported to the Spirit Realm â€“ a parallel world inhabited by spirits. In this new realm, Shiloh must embark on a journey to find his true identity and ultimately return to the land of the living. The outcome of Shiloh's journey will be decided by our community; NFT holders can vote on what happens next as each new chapter unfolds. Copyright XELEVEN Media Inc 2022.
