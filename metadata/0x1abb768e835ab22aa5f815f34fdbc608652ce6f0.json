    "description": "As her cells multiply\nUncontrollably, unforgivingly\nWith my lungs, I cry\nWith hers, all is scary\n \nToo young to comprehend\nToo young to believe\nStill can't understand the end\nStill think all is deceive\n \nChemicals failing, hopes as well\nMy strength totem, weakened severely\nWill medicines work, hoping time will tell\nBut time too is evil, false hopes surely\n \nYou can't be gone, I hug what's left\nCrazy world we live, all this a test\nThe machine flatlines, me a victim of theft\nI beg I cry, but god loves her best\n \nThis pain of lost, makes my chest bury\nMy queen gone, to this fickle endeavor\nBut in the grand scheme, death is temporary\nBecause within me, mama lives forever\n\n\n------\n\nThis piece is dedicated to my late mother who lost her battle to lung cancer in 2015. I hope this piece encapsulates my pain of her loss and immortalizes her in memory. \n\n10% of profits will go to a cancer charity in my home country. Receipt on twitter.",
