    "description": "The night sky is full of mysteries that if you look at it for hours, you will not get tired of seeing it, and a kind of peace pervades your whole being, and the stars smile at you one by one to make you more eager.\n\nThe night sky takes us to distant dreams somewhere between the clouds, next to the stars and the moon, and then maybe for a moment we separate from the earth and travel to the heart of the sky and reveal the secrets of the sky.\n\nI captured this photo at an altitude of 4,500 meters on the southern border of the Republic of Azerbaijan on a cold spring night after hours of hard walking and mountaineering.\n\nThis height and place was like a place of worship where you could hold the stars with your hands and touch them.\n\n\nCanon 6D - Lens : Canon 16-35 - Focal : 16mm\n\nJPEG image\nEdition: 1/1\nSize 5400 * 3600 px",
