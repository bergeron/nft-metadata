What if we create a being, an heir of the place, a creature of the synthesis of observation?\n\nThe act of calling Xlyrix out of oblivion will become a lament for past and inevitable future losses. \n\nThe project is dedicated to the study of aesthetic approaches of GAN and the use of such approaches in the creation of synthetic image.",
