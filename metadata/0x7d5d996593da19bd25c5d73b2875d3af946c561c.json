    "name": "Mind or Heart?",
    "description": "Before making a decision, we often ponder whether to listen to reason or to our heart. \nThe mind wants a meaningful, rational decision. We often rely on past, mostly negative experiences.\nAnd feelings, on the other hand, are controlled by fear. But they \"see\" our potential and are ready to throw us, like puppies, into the maelstrom of new possibilities. The heart will lead us into the future, it is the compass that points to our possibilities.\n\nSo what will you listen to? The call of the heart or the voice of the mind? Or maybe both?\n\nDigital art\nAnimation",
