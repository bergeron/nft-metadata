    "description": "There's a market where fresh fish are sold. On ordinary days, we shopped there. This bird appeared, curious, and different from the rest-- a reminder that magic and memory is everywhere, even in the most common scenes. Whether laundry hanging on a wire, or the particular shade of blue in the sky: poetry is around us constantly, if we pause to feel to it. \n\nThis is my genesis piece, as  Seed Poet, with much light to come. \n\nThe poem: \n\nI threw rocks at your bird\nbut they never connected \n\nYou scolded me\nconstantly\n\n\"That bird is an ancestor\n come back to haunt us\" \n\nThis nameless bird\nperched in silence\nthere everyday \n\n a statue above the street\nwhere children play,\nand drunks walk alone \nmaking their own bird \nnoises \n\n\nonce i touched his \nbeak \ncolder than I imagined \nand much more fragile \n\n##\nSpecial thanks to @omid_kzemi for adding magic\n",
