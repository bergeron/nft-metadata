    "description": "Surrounded by 4 Devils and 4 Devil's Angels the Devil's Pit is the final place for salvation of a demonic soul. \nThis Rendition shows the 4 paths that a soul can take to enter the pit. The soul enters the tubule from one of the four corners depending on the Devil himself, where it then passes through the creepy spiders, the fallen angels and the door keepers to  reach the final door of salvation which is guarded by four of the  Devil's Ministers, to finally enter the pit and be absorbed into Devil himself. This is the final Salvation of the demonic soul and it leaves from the other side to be reincarnated again and transferred to another body.\n\nAs it passes through the tubule the soul is tormented at every step. Only the one that deserves the salvation makes it to the pit.\n\nCopyright to this art stays with the owner of this NFT.",
