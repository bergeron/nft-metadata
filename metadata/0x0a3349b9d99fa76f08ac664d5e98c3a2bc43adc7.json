    "description": "The person is broken, falling apart, but to hide it, the person wears masks to show an outward more preferable appearance/attitude. All the masks look almost same, it represents the loss of ability to differentiate between a lie and a truth. We get so much trapped in our own lies, that we forget what part of us is true anymore. Everything seems real, yet feels fake. The green and black color represent the poison, taking over the lifeless body (since it's grey). Artist: Mehak Jain.",
