    "description": "\"The ball is in your court\"  \nHow well do we make use of the opportunities we get and the chances we're given, to better our lives, to lend a helping hand, to put smile on the faces of others?  \n\"The ball is in your court\", what will you do? Will you play or let it be?  \nRemember your only chance of wining is by playing and playing well.\n\nThis piece marks my entry into Minimalism as a form of art, and is also a part of my first Open Edition, which is a 4 in 1 Open Edition.  \nThis piece as well as the others in this Open Edition series are experimental, the aim is to use NFTs for a social cause, a path I thought of gearing towards this year.  \nIt's all about community and being of help to those in need.",
