    "description": "I've been reflecting on my journey and what I want moving forward. I want to continue to evolve and create, and I'm excited to bring my community along for the ride over the next 6 months.\n\nWhile I create my next album, I also want to revolutionize what it means to be in an artist's community in Web3. Each month, I'll be innovating and pushing the boundaries of what an artist can deliver to their community beyond just music\n\nI'll be releasing what I'm dubbing a 2-pack NFT drop, consisting of 2 songs that have a shared resonance, message, vibe, etc. One track from each 2-pack will end up on the album, but you won't know which one until it's completed.\n\nBut that's not all! Each 2-pack NFT drop will also include custom-designed merch that will be available to holders of the NFT (more info to be announced this week). This is an exclusive opportunity for my community to get their hands on limited edition CHILDLIKE items.\n\nAdditionally, each monthly 2-pack activation will be coupled with additional audio, visual, BTS, and IRL opportunities. Each month will bring new music, new aesthetics, and new rewards.\n\nMy community will get the inside scoop into my process as I build my next album, and I'll be pushing the boundaries of what it means to be an artist in Web3.\n\nSuper excited to see where this journey takes me. Thank you to my friends and collectors in Web3 for reigniting my passion for growing artistically, and I can't wait to see where we go from here.\n\nWe are Off The Shrooms & this is what we hear prior to the transition, the prelude!",
