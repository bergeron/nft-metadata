    "description": "Every person can be strong and brave regardless of gender especially in situations when for example they must protect their houses and close people. At the same time they can be sweet and kind in relationships with a loved one as well regardless of gender.\nIn this photos I intended to show girls who despite external fragility can be strong personalities if they deal with the situation when these qualities are necessary, keeping tenderness inside. Calm and tsunami. Light breeze and thunderstorm.",
