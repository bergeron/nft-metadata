    "description": "// Hayden 1/1 Genesis\n\n// A personal project showing the emotional turmoil of isolation and the anxiety and paranoia tied to self monitoring ones mental and physical health.\n\n// The chrome man resembles the inner self reflecting the desolation of the world, the HUD the paranoia of monitoring ones mental and physical health, the fog the isolation to the rest of mankind, and the bench / road with car as the wait until one can get back to a place more familiar then their current surroundings.\n\n// I started this project in December of 2019 when experiencing a lot of these emotions due to the restrictions during covid lockdowns.\n\n// I have been wrestling with what to mint as my first 1 of 1 on the Ethereum blockchain, and I always seem to come back to this piece and it makes a really important turning point for me fusing emotional turmoil with creative outlet.",
