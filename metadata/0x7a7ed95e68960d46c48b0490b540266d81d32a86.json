    "description": "I have forever been entranced by symmetry, patterns, and lines. I travel quite a lot for work and try to take every opportunity to get out and explore my surroundings. While visiting Atlanta, Georgia for the first time in the summer of '22, I couldn't help but marvel at the duality of clarity and distortion portrayed by this structure. Beauty to art lovers; an atrocity for glass installers. Let this photo remind us all that some of the most interesting sights are right under our noses if we slow down and pay attention.\n\nWalking through Atlanta, GA - 2022 - Canon T3i\n\n\n\n\nOne of the lucky collectors will receive a high-quality, signed, framed print of this edition. Good luck! ⌛✌️",
