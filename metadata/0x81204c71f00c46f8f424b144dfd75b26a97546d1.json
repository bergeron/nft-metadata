    "description": "The Tiger Nomad is tired of life and its dull, day-to-day activities. He feels a tug within his soul and longs for something greater - to feel true fulfillment.\n\nDespite not knowing what is outside his little village, and despite all the clouds and \"ominous\" signs, he sets off on a journey into the unknown, in search of a fresh start, in hopes of finding where he truly belongs.\n\nWhen you embark on a new journey into the unknown because your gut is telling you there's more to life than what you currently have, there's going to be fear + uncertainty. But sometimes life will bloom and give u signs that you're on the right track.\n\n\"A Fresh Start\" is the 1st piece of a total of 3 in the Tiger Nomad collection\n\n1740 x 2048 px, 400 px dpi",
