    "description": "This work was created by tracing a photograph taken in Nagasaki City, which I visited in November 2022. It is a large-scale work that I myself have never produced before, and I worked very hard on it as the conclusion to the year 2022. The title expresses my joy at being able to create a work set in Nagasaki, a city I have longed to visit since I started working in art.",
