    "description": "at six pm a cool atmosphere The soft sunlight that glows as the last light of the day And this is the last light of the year. My family and I went to pay homage to the sacred things at the City Pillar Shrine. The lights that are turned on at the City Pillar Shrine in the evening make the composition interesting.\n\nCamera: iPhone 13 Pro Max \nDate: 31 Dec 2021 \nPhotographer: Boyudon",
