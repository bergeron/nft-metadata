    "description": "Being open to creating outside of your \"norm\" can yield amazing results.  One autumn evening, I drove down to one of my favorite local places in North Jersey to shoot the George Washington Bridge at sunset.  The evening was less than spectacular, so I decided to try something different.  From my vantage point I could see the silhouettes of cars and trucks driving across the upper deck.  I started to shoot, but realized my angle was to steep and it wouldn't translate well.  Just when I was going to pack it up, I  noticed that someone was using the north walkway, which was rarely open, and I began to track and try to align them to get a clean silhouette. On my next to last frame, I captured one of my favorite minimalistic images I've ever captured.  Moral of the story: Be patient and try new things. You'll be surprised with what you come up with.",
