    "description": "# Beginnings Pearl\nPearl diving has been tightly woven into UAE culture and dates back to more than 7,000 years. The industry created a period of wealth for the country and relied on extensive expertise, from shipbuilding to sailing. For years, the finest pearls in the world were found in the warm waters of the Arabian Gulf and were considered the most sought-after accessories of the time. \"Beginnings Pearl\" is an artistic homage to this time in history.",
