    "description": "Digital Fractures\n\nNOTHING IS SAFE. It is just an illusion that our brain unconsciously shows us.\n\nToday I want to show you a spoiler of what you will see in the coming days…\nLet’s start the story from the drawing from which this project was born.\nThe message\n\nThis work tells the experience of trauma that we all live for different reasons. Even if I’m really young I lived in my life extreme moments and situations that changed me but today I’m not here to tell you that, there will certainly be an opportunity in the future.\n\nIn the web universe as in real life there aren’t certainties, nothing is sure.\nPeople experience different traumas every day; wars, bankruptcies, earthquakes…\nAll these tragedies have in common the trauma that people involved suffer.",
