    "description": "This piece explores the concept: what is a digital photograph? The camera captures a representation of light, edited, but what is the asset? Code is what is created, but it's not what we see. The base, fundamental creation is buried deep beneath the layers of interpretation and manipulation that turn it visible and viewable. Based on a photograph of my eldest son, this animation is constructed from the code of the original digital file. The code of the file was manually stripped of tens of thousands of paragraph break characters and white space, before being laid down to create the image again. Each time this PSD file is opened, the text updates as the program attempts to understand the coded characters; this quirk marks each edition as unique. Each JPG saved is a stamp in time, in itself as ephemeral as the moment captured in the original photograph. The first three JPG editions form this piece as a 4K GIF, 4000px x 2666px: the file at 13 March 2021 at 5.40pm, at 5.44pm and at 5.46pm.",
