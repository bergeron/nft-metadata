    "description": "Hoshi \n\nThe piece Hoshi is a starting point collection for Hoshishan's illustrations as it talks a little bit about the artist. \n\nThe subject of the illustration comes with the butterfly with a broken wing from trying to reach the star (Hoshi).\nThe traits of a butterfly about being small, delicate, and not being able to reach high range is how the artist describes herself when trying to reach a certain goal or high achievement. Her perception about her desired future seemed for her to be impossible to reach. A fascinating truth, butterflies are tougher than we all think. In the illustration, the butterfly shows that she is able to recover her broken wing. That signifies the artist's hope for success.\n\n",
