    "name": "A Circle Of Quest",
    "description": "We all search for it everywhere. Some call it truth, Some call it a quest, and for some, it's a journey. The more we look for it, the more we come spinning out of nothingness, scattering like sands on the beach. \n\nWhere to find it, you ask? It's always right in front of us, hiding in simplicity. Who else is a better teacher to teach us than Mother Earth?\n\nThe inspiration of this abstract image comes from her. Rau√∞asandur Beach is an isolated beach in the westfjords of Iceland. Unlike most of the Icelandic beaches, this is unique in its deep golden red colour. The magic doesn't stop there. With the changing sunlight, the colours of the beach changes from light yellow to a deep orange red. \n\nFormations in our mind and in life are also changing. Yet, we try to grasp every moment, and it escapes us. All the happiness, confusion that arise, they vanish away just like the changing colour of this beach. Isn't that a simple lesson? So, let's begin and end our quest in the arms of mother Earth.",
