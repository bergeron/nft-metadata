    "description": "Decentralized Disco\" is a freakin' lit party thrown by a group of young Bitcoin enthusiasts to celebrate the creation of the digital currency's whitepaper. They invited some big shots to come talk about the latest developments in Bitcoin, blockchain, and NFTs, and then they had a wild ass party for everyone to come and cut loose, party hard, drink up and have a good time. They named it \"Decentralized Disco\" 'cause it sounds cool and it's like a nod to the idea of decentralization and a good time. The party goers came to dance, let loose and have a good time, and that's exactly what they did.",
