    "description": "This is the story of Formidia.\n\nFormidia was once like every city on Earth; a plot of untouched land. The mountains to the northwest provided cover from wind. The river offered fresh water. \n\nAfter much time, Formidia became a beautiful destination for culture, the arts, and tourism. Outside connections to other cities began to form, fueling the fire. \n\nEventually, business ventures became the central focus, leading to exponential growth in advancements and the accumulation of wealth. Some believe the focus on maximum efficiency is too much.\n\nNobody knows what’s next for Formidia. Past generations no longer recognize the city they once grew up in. But that’s part of life. It’s now up to the citizens to push the boundaries of civilization in whatever way they choose.\n\nEvery image from this collection has been carefully crafted. 9 images were chosen from over 101 iterations.\n\nI see this collection as a time capsule on the bleeding edge of what consumer AI imagery is capable of.",
