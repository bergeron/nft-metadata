    "description": "This is the first exhibition at the FoundationÔºÅ\nThe way of drawing is different from usual.\nI usually draw bright pictures.\n\nPart of the proceeds of this work will be donated to the Embassy of Ukraine.\n\nI saw a lot of footage when the battle started.\nIt's so terrible.  \nI wondered if I could do anything. \nAnd I strongly wanted to draw this work and deliver it. \n\nPigeon Blood (A dark ruby gemstone is called Pigeon Blood.  Pigeon Blood's stone language is passion, pure love, courage)\n\nIn this work, I dared to separate Pigeon and Brad.\nSymbol of peace, dove, olive crown.\nGrains dripping from the gem Pigeon Blood.\nIt can be interpreted in various ways.\nMany people in the world are sad.\n\nThe rose behind. I mean that person.\nThat person often gives a bouquet.\nThe flower language of roses is love. It is a distorted rose with sharp thorns.\nIt can be interpreted in various ways. \n\nWhen someone who agrees with the conflict sees,\nI pray that a change will occur in that person's heart.",
