    "description": "To see no evil, one can either turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings and ills of society or take an intentional approach of not looking at things that provoke ill intentions. These differing courses of action offer two choices: to either live your life in wilful ignorance or choose a meditative existence governed by positive intentions. \n\nWith her arms covered in a vibrant pattern of designs and colours, the Wise Woman covers her eyes to shield them from witnessing any misdeeds or wrongdoings. The viewer is left to wonder, what has this Wise Woman seen that has led her to conceal her eyes? Is it her own misdeeds that she chooses to ignore or someone elseâ€™s? Or is she blissfully ignoring the harsh reality of our current times? This artwork invites us to perhaps take a harder look at what we might be ignoring about ourselves and the life we continue to live.",
