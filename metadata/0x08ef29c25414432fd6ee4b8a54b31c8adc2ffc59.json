    "description": "This work originates from a series called 'Peep Show - A Series of Peculiar Portraits.'\n\nThey aim to be surreal explorations of culture and traditional dress. With a radical attempt to depart from the political they aim to submerge the viewer into a more ethereal and whimsical space. Their aesthetic bound in artifice and the theatrical.\n",
