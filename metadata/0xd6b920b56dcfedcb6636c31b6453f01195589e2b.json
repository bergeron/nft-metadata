    "description": "This series, Fiddling while Rome Burns, focuses on the darkness of human consumption and the impermanence of the natural world. It attempts to illustrate the morbidity of a diseased earth. Each image is a display of indistinct consumption brought into focus through the use blatant high resolution. Through biblical, philosophical, and poetic allusions to life, death and the human consumption of earth, each image is a display of the transient nature of our world and the vain, misguided, disconnected relationship we have with it.",
