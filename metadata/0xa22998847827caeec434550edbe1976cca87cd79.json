    "description": "Goddess Saraswati is a deity of knowledge, wisdom and eloquence. She is described in Hindu Religion as the Goddess of music, wisdom, speech, language, literature, art, aesthetics, dance, music and learning. Goddess Saraswati is an aspect of the Divine Mother. As a creative inspiration and peace-bringer, she engenders beauty, protection and fertility in all beings. She is represented as the wife of Brahma, who is the creator of the universe. The Rig Veda and the Yajur Veda refer to Goddess Saraswati as 'one who leads' and 'one who presides'. For this reason, she is also known as Karuna (compassion), Kala (time) and MahaMaya (one who envelops the universe with illusion).\n\n** Non-Animated High-resolution version is available for collectors; contact the artist via DM. \n\n** Music/Vocals by Samarth Saxena, recorded in studios with pro musicians, exclusive to the Rebel Club's Diwali Collab, with 15+ artists. \n\nLicences\n* Artwork: CC BY-SA \n* Audio: CC-BY-NC-SA\n\nArtwork by KushArt ",
