    "description": "Eyes are the window to the soul. Our souls are eternal and expansive. Everywhere you look in this piece there is a hidden gem. From literal gems, to angel numbers and breasts. You will find what you need when you need it. \n\nEvery time you gaze upon this artwork I want you to be awe inspired and to feel in balance. Everyday we balance our light selves and shadow selves. Some struggle with this more than others but its there for everyone. This piece pays homage to embracing the whole self, working through the shadow and seeing it in all its glory.\n\nEven in darkness there is beauty. ",
