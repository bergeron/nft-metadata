This is the first work of the collection and my first work on foundation.\n \nIâ€™ve tried to make my ideas concise and clear - NFT art to the creak of an old vinyl record.\n\nThe philately collection is a link between the past and the present. Itâ€™s based on painting and living in the world of NFTs through animation and music.\n\n\n\nðŸ”¹Technology:\n\nGouache, Acrylic + Photoshop, After Effects, Ableton live",
