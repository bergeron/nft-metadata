    "description": "WORLD 1: SHAPESHiFTED\n\nTRACK 1: MAiWORLD (SNACKS.XYZ REMiX)\n\nMAi: I met Snacks when we both ended up on the same squad for Songcamp's Genesis camp.  Joined by Matthew Chaim as well, our squad created, arguably, one of the greatest music NFTs known to mankind to this day, \"Antid0t3\".  But that's another story for another day.  I discovered during this camp that Snacks is what I like to refer to as a \"super producer\"; someone who can play every instrument, produce, mix/engineer, and really, accommodate any style of song to make it better.  When i thought of people to remix WORLD 1, Snacks was an easy first round draft pick; and he delivered.  \n\nSNACKS:  I was really inspired off the 8-bit pixel art the original project and decided to do my remix with some video game tones with the flitch tune chords and the Zelda flute.  Most of what ended up on the song camp from one live keys performance over the vox stem, which is why it feels a bit spontaneous.  \n\nORIGINAL SONG: https://beta.catalog.works/maiworld/maiworld\nSHAPESHiFTED BY: SNACKS.XYZ\nMASTERED BY: MiGHTY33",
