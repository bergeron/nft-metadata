    "description": "This digital piece serves an inquiry into the perception of women as bait in the life of ignorant men. Over many years, women have been seen as objects that can be devoured according to one’s desires.\nFrom a young age, society has dictated the way we dress and how we present ourselves in public as if we are food being plated in a restaurant before being served to people. I painted this piece to serve as a literal representation of these beliefs.\nMy choice of using eggs to replace parts of the figures’ bodies is due to their physical characteristics and symbols. An egg can take any shape or form and can be manipulated to look and taste a certain way when made.\nIn the painting, I decided to juxtapose my original reasoning behind using the eggs; hence I replaced the women’s heads with an egg yolk also because a yolk symbolizes the sun and gold. This shows that like the sun and gold, a woman’s mind is bright, precious, and should be of the most value, rather than her body.",
