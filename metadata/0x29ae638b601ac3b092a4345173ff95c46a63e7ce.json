    "name": "the song of spring",
    "description": "At one time I was very interested in Karelian petroglyphs, their symbolism and of course their graceful shapes. I wanted to interpret them in my own way in my paintings.\nAfter making a tiny sketch for the work I realized that it should be realized in a larger format and convey an everlasting sense of peace. That's how the colours for this work were chosen, and then the title. Two people happily playing and singing a song to the blossoming and harmonious spring. It is still one of my favourite painting I've made.\n\nMaterials used: Oil pastels, acrylics, organolith\nOriginal size: 200 Ñ… 170 cm\n2021",
