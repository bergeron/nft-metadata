    "description": "Caravanserai\nMore than two thousand years ago, throughout the East, along the route of commercial caravans, buildings were erected for inns or even, when necessary, a stronghold against enemy attacks. This building was called an inn. Most caravans and travelers stopped at caravanserais for the night.\n\nThe caravanserais along the long Silk Road, like a beacon in the heart of the deserts, have guided trade caravans from ancient times to early modern times.\n\nExtended Editorial License:\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
