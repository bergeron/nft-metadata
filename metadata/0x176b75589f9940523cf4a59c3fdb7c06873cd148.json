    "description": "\"Stare into the abyss, and it stares back at you.\" \n\nFar from the original quote from Nietzsche's \"Beyond good and evil\", this has now a whole different meaning for a lot of people.\n\nThis is about diving deep into our darker side, our deepest fears and secrets. The part of us we hide, even to ourselves. This is about struggling to reach the light in our lives. \n\nThis is about the nights we spend sleepless, deprived of the relief we desperately seek, even for a moment.  \n\nThis is about being tired and wanting to give in to the voices in our heads, in our hearts. About drinking that poison while no one is watching. This is about getting closer and closer to the edge. \n\nThis is about contemplating the void\n\nDiving a little deeper, forgetting about the surface and the warmth of the sun. Embracing the abyss and finding comfort in the darkness. Dissolving to exist in a deafening silence.\n\nWe are safe now.",
