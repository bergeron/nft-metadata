    "description": "An exploration of light, grounded in physical reality, but reinterpreted through code. Each scene is set with only a handful of spheres in motion, some refracting, and the rest emitting computer-simulated rays of light. Billions of these rays are cast through the scene, each with their own wavelength and phase determining their complete trajectory and final color contribution to the image. This detailed and physically-based approach to rendering allows the program to produce images that are simultaneously rooted in reality, but also transcend it by bending rules and allowing for observations in a way only possible through simulation.\n\nThese experiments lie at the intersection of art, technology, and science, and they are born from my own sense of wonder and awe with the medium of computer artwork. They represent a study of motion, light, and simple geometric forms, which through simulation challenge the relationship between the physical and the digital.\n\nJavaScript and GLSL  \nPNG 5800x4800px",
