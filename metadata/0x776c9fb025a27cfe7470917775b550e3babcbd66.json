    "description": "'Reflection' is based on image files, each image is randomly pixelated. There are various ways to cut out the information that surrounds us. \n\nIt expresses the multiple perspectives and randomness of how one thing is received. The phenomenon is reflected in this mature web society as if it were a mirror of each other. \n\nThe more perspectives there are, the more beautifully it shines like a mirror with many faces.\n",
