    "description": "\"Summer on my Mind\"\n\nThose who know me know that I feel most comfortable on cold mountains and in foggy forests. Due to COVID travel restrictions we had to cancel our trip to the US in 2021. A replacement was needed quickly. It was October, we had four weeks to travel and it wasn't the perfect season to go to many of the other European destinations on our list.\nI knew there were many interesting places on the Canary Islands so we booked the trip. What can I say? Even in October it was damn hot there. Hiking was out of the question and we had to spend time on the beaches until the sun was lower and it got a little cooler. I hated it. It felt like a waste of time. We were so happy to be back in Germany, where we could still get a glimpse of autumn.\nLooking back, however, it was one of the most beautiful trips. It was a trip that only got really nice after the trip. Like a memory covered in sugar icing. \n\n\nLocation: Fuerteventura, Spain\n\nYear: 2021\n\nArtist: Sergio Antoni\n\nEdition: 1/1",
