    "name": "THE BEACH",
    "description": "“THE BEACH” is an experiment painting, an improvisation. At the time of its creation, it was completely different from all the art works I had created earlier. Like the other works from the Pastel Girls series, this painting has been done in retro erotics pastel colours. The image of the girl in the artwork is rather fictional, it was created merely by the memories of a girl by the sea who I saw during a summer holiday in my younger years. I wonder where the girl from that beach is now..",
