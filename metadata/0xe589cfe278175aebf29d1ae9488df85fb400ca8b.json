    "description": "«Let's keep it for better times»\n\nVisible destruction became part of the landscape of the deoccupied north of Ukraine. Foreign politicians and journalists come to see them. Witnesses and victims of crimes are trying to get used to their new status. They resemble museum workers, demonstrating their ruins to a curious audience. Domestic clutter reminds of a life that has become a tourist attraction. \nHowever, there remains a side that cannot be evaluated from the outside. I am talking about a private disaster that has turned into a museum of dust and ashes. This side of the tragedy remains unattainable to the visitor. \nWhen and how did the sense of normality cease to exist?\n\nUA | Hostomel, Kyiv region.\nJune 2022\n10944х7296",
