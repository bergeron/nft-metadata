    "description": "The Prince of Wales Hotel; this is a shot from Waterton National Park and an image I took during my first year of living out in Alberta. \n\nMy friend and I made a last minute decision to drive from Canmore to Waterton to see it for the first time so we could do some camping and hiking towards the end of summer. We ended up finding a campground but had to sleep in the van because a massive thunderstorm rolled through that almost wiped out our tents. Prior to that, we sat at the campfire under the stars and it was actually the first time I ever shot the milkyway - terribly if we're being honest.\n\nI captured this image the next day on our way across the water by boat to hike the Crypt Lake Trail. This is one of the images that made me fall in love with shooting at the brighter times of day with harsh light and I love the colours that come with those conditions.\n\nCollectors will receive a 1/1 print at a size of 11 x 14 on paper that best compliments the image.",
