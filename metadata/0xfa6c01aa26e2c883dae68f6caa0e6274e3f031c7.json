    "description": "The old man stretched out his wrist and as he aligned it with Vee’s wrist both their subdermal chip implants lit up activating an interface. The old man input the amount he owed and signed his transaction. A few seconds later Vee confirmed the Ether had been transferred to her wallet’s address. She pulled back her hand and the blade retracted as the nanobots that made up her bionic arms reshuffled.\n\n‘This better be the eye!’, shouted the old man angrily after Vee as she walked out of the ramen shop. ‘I know where to find you if it’s not!’",
