    "description": "This painting is based on Quantum Cosmology.  \n \nSystems with quantum behavior do not follow the rules that we are used to, they are hard to see and hard to “feel,” can have controversial features, exist in several different states at the same time – and even change depending on whether they are observed or not. \n \nThis painting expresses the properties and behaviors of the very building blocks of nature.",
