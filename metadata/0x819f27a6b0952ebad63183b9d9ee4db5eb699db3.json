The original driving footage, which includes spinning wind turbines, warning arrows and guard rails is montaged through multiple cuts, zooms, and fades to create a dreamlike atmosphere and convey the centrifugal force and sensation of outdoor adventure.\n\nPlease scan the QR code on your IO to verify your certificate of authenticity, on-chain.
