    "description": "‘Hesseract’ is a unique piece based on the established geometric design motif of the artist’s previous work, ‘Tesseract’, involving floating cubes interacting with cascading ribbons. Working with the ‘H’ motif of this collection, this motif has been arranged to form an ‘H’ accordingly. Drawing inspiration from the artist’s residency in the Middle East, the ’T' in ‘Tesseract' has been playfully replaced with ‘H’, with ‘Hessa’ translating to ‘Destiny’ in Arabic, forming a fitting continuation with the underlying concept behind the original ’Tesseract’ body of work.",
