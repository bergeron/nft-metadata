    "description": "Life is beautiful, and it comes with unimaginably painful challenges that more, and more people are having to face. Challenges that require leaving home in order to survive, or protect the people who matter most: family.\n\nRefugees are everywhere, and they're particularly vulnerable wherever they go, because they're easy targets for populism, and individuals looking for someone to blame for their troubles. Things don't always get better when they reach their destination.\n\nRefugees are more than people from another place. They're family, when you understand that names, places, races, and colour, are labels instead of true difference and everyone comes from good people who were also displaced at some point in history. Everyone wants to live bravely and happily.\n\nRefugees are like you and me. \n\n*The earnings from this piece will be entirely donated. 1/2 will go to an Iranian Women relief non-profit organization, and the other 1/2 to a Ukranian conflict relief organization.",
