    "name": "A Dream of the Self",
    "description": "I have lost myself in a dream and in doing so found The Way. \n\nZhuangzi, (Chuang-tzu 莊子 “Master Zhuang” late 4th century BC) was a philosopher in ancient China, who, one night went to sleep and dreamed that he was a butterfly. He dreamt that he was flying around from flower to flower and while he was dreaming he felt free, blown about by the breeze hither and thither. He was quite sure that he was a butterfly. But when he awoke he realised that he had just been dreaming, and that he was really Chuang Tzu dreaming he was a butterfly. But then Chuang Tzu asked himself the following question: \"was I Chuang Tzu dreaming I was a butterfly or am I now really a butterfly dreaming that I am Chuang Tzu?\"\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers.
