    "name": "A  Gambler's Fragility ",
    "description": "My uncle is a gambler. He started gambling when he was twenty until he lost all his savings and made my aunt die from too much heartbreak. However, as a family member, I have no way to completely hate the pain he has caused our family, nor can I reconcile with him.\n\nThe photo was taken in 2021, and he just had an operation to remove three stones from his body. He was lying on the red sofa that day, showing his scars sideways, showing his fragility, so I pressed the shutter.\n\nLove is complicated. Maybe contradictions and happiness coexist in order to be counted as a complete family.",
