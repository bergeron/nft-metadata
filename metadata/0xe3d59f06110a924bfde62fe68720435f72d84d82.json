    "description": "Where the London Fog series began.\n\nWhilst on the way to my first day of work at Apple, London was shrouded in thick low fog. Adamant that I wanted to capture at least one photo of the atmospheric scenes, I detoured from my journey and began taking photos. \n\nCompletely engrossed by what I was seeing, one photo quickly turned into 300 and two hours had passed.\n\nNeedless to say, I was late for my first day of work.\n\nThis image also became the cover image of my first solo book \"London Fog\", which has been sold globally in renowned book stores such as Waterstones and was featured as one of The TIMES Photography Books of the Year 2019.",
