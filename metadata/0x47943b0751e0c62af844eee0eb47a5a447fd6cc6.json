    "description": "Weeping Woman (with diamond hands) is an animate pixel painting appropriating Pablo Picasso’s painting ‘Weeping Woman’. The ‘Meme-ification’ of Weeping Woman (with diamond hands) explores a new narrative, one of potential joy; a stark contrast of the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) captured by Picasso in the original canvas.",
