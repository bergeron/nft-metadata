    "description": "I've always loved new technologies, as I'm an inquisitive person that loves new things and everything unknown, and because of that, crypto has been a super interesting piece of technology that I've been able to be a part of last year. There are various concerns about its environmental impact, and while I think that (as well as many things around us) it's true that there's some impact, I believe that nature will always win. Link is a piece that speaks just about that, and about how both technology and nature can coexist together.\n\nUnique piece exhibited at 0xSociety's MetaVRse from February 24th until April 24th, 2022.\n\nMore info here:\nhttps://0x-society.medium.com/editorial-metavrse-preservation-in-the-digital-age-4653be2a13cc\n\n5000x6250px\nSantiago, Chile.",
