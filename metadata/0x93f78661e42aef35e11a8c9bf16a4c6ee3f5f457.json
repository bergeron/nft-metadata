    "description": "Deep within the Iguazú National Park are the Iguazú Falls. \n On this evening I was shooting the falls with the moon high in the sky behind me.  The moon was illuminating the scene that otherwise had zero artificial lighting.  \n\nWhat was also simultaneously occurring is that the moonlight was being captured in the mist generated by the waterfalls.  \n\nThe result was this moonbow across Iguazú Falls.  \n\nA wonderful capture of nature at night.    \n\nThis unique image will only be minted once as an NFT and will not be replicated.\n\nThe initial collector of this image will also receive a 30\" x 20\" print on high quality fine art archival paper.  Shipping logistics to be arranged via DM at end of auction period.\n\n",
