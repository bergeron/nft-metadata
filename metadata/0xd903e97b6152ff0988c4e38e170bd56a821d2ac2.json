    "description": "6527 × 4896 px\nPhase one P45+\n\nIn 2007, Romania joined the European Union. In March 2017, I took stock via a road trip through central Romania. It turned out to be an adventure just as I had imagined. After a decade of slight progress, things were again going in the wrong direction for one of Europe's most corrupt countries. With recent judicial reforms, the inability to fight corruption was getting worse.\nDistrust was the common thread throughout my trip.\n\nIn my series 'Romania twelve points, la Roumanie douze points,' I want to create an atmospheric image of a country that needs work. But Europe can.\n\nWhereas my previous series 'Hong Kong Stillness' created a rather poetic image on and allowed a broader interpretation of a global society, this collection aims to do the opposite. Through a straightforward way of photographing, I want to reflect the reality of the concrete situation in Romania through cruder images.\n\n\n",
