Photographed in Sapporo 2019 amidst a global pandemic that impacted millions. The entire city was in a state of emergency. The streets were empty and unlike anything I have seen or will ever see again. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience. \n\nHuman connection makes you feel seen and valued. \nFeel heard, understood and gives you a sense of belonging.",
