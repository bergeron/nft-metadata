      "text": "Downtrodden \nCold hearted \nCold blooded \nThe game jade you\nNiggas hate you for getting money \nI need something, I went off, I was hungry, I need quickly, I move swiftly, we went hunting \nYou hesitate in war you dead, \nWhy I feel like most the battles in my head\nReal sticky, can’t shake it, can’t break it, can’t make it \nYou start to force it, dark forces, not fortune \n\nI need 50, 2 50’s, that’s one hundred, one homie he start gunning, it start running\nDark summers, fools gather for hood summits and shared traumas, shared notes and baby momma\n\nHad the lint inside my pocket, playing with the texture, I was sitting cross the street from the dealer with the Lexus \nI had options, I made choices, I was dealing with the voices\nIf I can make it through then I rejoice it \n\nLook we ain’t goin up for nothing \nWe needin for something \nPaths unlock take a risk and it’s jumpin\nMake one wrong move slip fall and you plummet \nNo butterflies in the stomach you either comin or not\n\nIf I go down, are you with? \nIf I go down you come with? \nIf I go down for the risk now my brother are you coming with? \n\nResponsibilities for my abilities \nI make something happen, out of nothing often\nAll the pressure on me, bring desperation on me\nHeater on me, paranoia, I don’t trust the homies \nSee experience, repetitive, I done heard and I said the shit, Seen the shit in nightmares past, I confronted it \nReally think that I wanted it, chased it maybe I caught it. Might not be the luck that you think, maybe I got it \n\nCould turn to the curse of the ego to hurt people \nCould start out the purest intentions still turn evil \nHow much power till you hit limits of that corruption \nThe opposite of what they expect, I be disrupting \n\nI didn’t listen when they said I should stop I kept it bussin \nWe ain’t even call resilient, We was just hustling \nJust to get little money to get up again, and draw it up again, and pick it up again \n\nLook we ain’t goin up for nothing \nWe needin for something \nPaths unlock take a risk and it’s jumpin\nMake one wrong move slip fall and you plummet \nNo butterflies in the stomach you either comin or not\n\nGod damn \nAre you coming with me?\n",
