    "name": "The Wise Owly and the Little Lupus",
    "description": "Owly was the wise owl who was the head of the post office. He lived in a village whose inhabitants were not happy and never knew what it was to wish and wish.  He did not consider himself responsible only for the post office, but also for the lives of all the villagers.\nEvery day after work, he would go and listen quietly and silently to the sad whispers of the people, and the next morning, in the name of a stranger, he would send them happiness and wishes in a letter and post them. kind Owly bestowed such infinite kindness on the villagers. Until one night, while walking in the moonlight, he saw a small wolf cub that could not even open its eyes due to its weakness. Owly hugged him and flew home. Owly named him Lupus and nurtured him every day and taught him his wisdom until Lupus became Owly's assistant in the post office.",
