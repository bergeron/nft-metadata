    "description": "“Configurations” and “With Songs” are works from artist Wang Ziling’s fantastic collection of 2022. Born in Hunan China, the London-based artist is a rising star in the international arena of young artists, presenting her sophisticated understanding of space and perception through works that are bold and beautiful. The works in this series were magically made using hardened, standing paint, a method Ziling invented herself, to achieve a sculptural effect. The transformation of two dimensional image into three dimensional sculpture creates a curious continuum between otherwise divided spaces, and invites a whole new viewing experience. Dimension: 56 x 55 x 4.5cm; Medium: hardened paint.",
