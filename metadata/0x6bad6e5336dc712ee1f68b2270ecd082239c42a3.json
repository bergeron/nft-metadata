    "description": "Obviously hidden / maybe a self portrait\n\nDigitized and digital edited pencil drawing\n\n5000 Ã— 5000 px, 300dpi\n\n2021\n\n\"Obviously Hidden / Maybe a Self Portrait\" is part of the \"Repeating Leaves\" collection.\n\n\"Repeating Leaves\" is an ongoing art experiment which in the end will consist of 32 unique artworks. Every piece in this collection is based on a physical pencil drawing of a simple branch with leaves, digitized and digital edited, repeated and recombined. It's about exploring the possibilities between abstraction and figuration, physical and digital. How much can you do with such limited material? What kind of motifs can be created and how? When does figuration dissolve and abstraction arise?",
