    "description": "Daydreamer: Estrella\n\nDaydreamers represents the fine line between reality and imagination, how we can create something surreal from something as simple and natural as a flower, and how a flower can become a dream of desire and melancholy as one wanders lulled by its constant motion.\n\nEstrella dreams quietly in a dark green sky full of little white star-shaped flowers.\n\nThrough my art, I like to show our vulnerability, our personality, and feelings, everything that makes us human and connects us with ourselves and with nature.\n\nThis collection is a mix of my photography interlaced with Ai and digitally retouched.\n\n--\n\nAI generator: DALLE  \nLocation: Cuernavaca, Mexico  \nEdition: 1/1 \nYear: 2022/2023  \nArtist: Luci Obregon  \nDimensions: 5920 x 5124",
