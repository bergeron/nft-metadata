    "description": "Every photographer arrives at their destination full of optimism.  Today's going to be the day!  The sunset clouds are going to be fantastic!  I'm going to capture a dozen meteors streaking past the Milky Way core!  The aurora borealis will provide a dazzling backdrop for this epic Bigfoot shot (a long exposure taken while he sits perfectly still, of course)...  \n  \nThen reality sets in.  It's raining.  There are too many clouds.  There aren't enough clouds.  The meteors never show up, or Bigfoot had too much caffeine in the afternoon.  It happens.  \n  \nThe photo shoot goes on, of course.  We snap our shots, sometimes hundreds, sometimes thousands, in hopes of capturing that one perfect moment, but sometimes we come home empty-handed.  It's those final moments of the shoot, that **Slow Fade**, that I think resonate with everyone who's ever held a camera hoping for gold.  \n  \nIn those moments, the real essence of what we've captured isn't found in the scene, but in ourselves.  Despite this slow fade, we'll be back next time.  And we'll bring with us optimism, hope, and a freshly cleared camera card!  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Artist:**  Steve Walasavage  \n**Series:**  This And That  \n**Collection:**  Steve Walasavage Editions  \n**Edition:**  1/25 NFT  \n  \n---  \n  \n*\"Steve Walasavage Editions\"* is a set of editions released over the course of my career as a photographer, artist, and multidisciplinary phenom (citation needed).  \n  \nAll editions are ERC-1155 tokens minted on the [Steve Walasavage Editions](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61db92d6349cd56d8accd059fd1c12a6bd60fcb2) custom smart contract.\n\nExtended Editorial License:  Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
