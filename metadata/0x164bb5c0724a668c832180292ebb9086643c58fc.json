    "description": "In shadow, life lives.   \nIn much of my work, I find myself in a deep dive into shadows and how they tell their own mysterious story. I also allude to how these shadows hold a deeper meaning, often implying how I identify with living abroad and the conflicts that come from change. \nBut, at the end of the day..they just look so good! \nThis is a compliment to my recently released collection \"Life In Shadow\".  \nEnjoy!\n\nTitle: Shadow Of A Man\n\nArtist: ERIK WITSOE\n\nDimensions: 3120 x 4680\n\nLocation: Warsaw, Poland \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
