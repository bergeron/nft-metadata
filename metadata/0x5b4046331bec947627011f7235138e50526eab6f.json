    "description": "Every civilisation starts with the enlightenment of an ascetic or a philosopher.\nIt is a painful journey, you need to swallow the pain in order to relieve it; when you gulp it for a generation and for the generations to come, you become a healer or a buddha.\nWhile sitting idle beneath a lonely baobab tree in the vast Savannah, and chewing a fruit that just fell over his head,  Zee Buddha contemplated about the earthly riddles.\nHe breathed in, deeply.\nA few momentâ€™s pause, he breathed out\nThe deep misery and pain life gives, whether in the Savannah, Arabia or in the Atlantic; has a root cause. The craving to prey each other, the vengeance that is passed down through generations, the disruption of flocks and packs for the sake of lust, or the bloody fights for power; all have a common cause - the wild, animal instinct or the uncontrollable desire. \nZee Buddha smiled as if he discovered a medicine for a deadly pandemic.\nDesire is the cause of despair.",
