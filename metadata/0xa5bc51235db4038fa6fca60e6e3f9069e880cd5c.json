    "description": "The first in a series bearing witness to the old growth sentinels of the North Shore's Coast Mountains. To what remains, to what withers, to what rots and is returning to this earth. To honour their participation in the world, to mark it in a small and absurd way through visual record and geospatial data, and to thank them for their service.\n\nHonour The Ents | Springboards captures the marks of the Feller’s axe to form notches for springboard placements used at the turn of the 19th Century to access the trunk above the flare butt of these giants.\n\nWhat remains today of this tree rests a stones throw from the District of North Vancouver Fire & Rescue Station No. 3 in upper Mosquito Creek, on the lower flanks of Grouse Mountain. The waypoint location and elevation where Springboards can be found are noted in yellow, for intrepid wanderers. \n\nHonour The Ents is a digital remembrance of analog giants of British Columbia’s Coast Mountains captured forever on the Ethereum blockchain.",
