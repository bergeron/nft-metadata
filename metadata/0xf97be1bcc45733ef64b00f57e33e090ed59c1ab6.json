    "description": "My first time exploring Costa Rica was otherworldly, providing an overdue respite for mind, body, and soul. I felt my spirit returning to its purest form, connecting with the earth and becoming one with my surroundings. This piece was captured in the natural parks outside of Liberia, far removed from the distractions of modern life, where the only sounds are the rush of the water and the wind whispering among the trees. This couple stood out to me with their quiet sense of contentment, a comfort established after years of togetherness. ",
