    "name": "Year 1 - The Yeast Era",
    "description": "Starting out with this thing, more out of boredom than anything else, I chose the easy entry route of yeast driven doughs. Even though this supposedly fail prove thing I had to throw away the first three or four breads I baked. No pics of this gigantic failure, sorry. After a while I did not end up with rock hard, very flat pancake breads anymore. A lot of experimenting and \"getting the hang of it\" later I started to get edible results. Much like getting into Houdini actually (minus the edible). ",
