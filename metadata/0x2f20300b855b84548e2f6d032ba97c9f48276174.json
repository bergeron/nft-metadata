    "description": "This self-portrait series aims to capture a wakeful dream of a troubled utopia, an uncertain paradise.\n\nIt portrays a supposed natural being, a man, naked in the wilderness, who is at once humble and vulnerable, sadly and absurdly naked, but also an emblem of male will to power: a hunter, a conquerer. The figure represented is a natural being, a part of the landscape, but also a question posed to self-consciousness. Is the man we see doomed to hopeless self-definition, unable to find a stable sense of being? Is every truth he attempts to grasp essentially fugitive? He is without tools, technology, or clothing, and without any horizon in which to form a fulfilled concrete being in the world.\n\nWhat we find in these pictures is an image of challenged masculinity that is so pertinent to our times.",
