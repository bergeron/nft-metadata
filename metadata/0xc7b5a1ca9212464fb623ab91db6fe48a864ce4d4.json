    "description": "A summer with Van Gogh. From this photograph I got the initial idea for one of my first works on SR back in 2020. A long while ago, the NFT world has changed. I did change too. \n\nI've always tried to combine my photography with painting but somehow they always end up to be 2 different worlds, one is my energetic nature and the other more about rearranging reality. I think I like to create a SR series on photography for them now, they deserve so.",
