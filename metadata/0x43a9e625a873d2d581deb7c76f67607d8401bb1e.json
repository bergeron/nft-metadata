    "description": "Hey web3!\n\nMy name is Mark Evans. I'm a music producer / songwriter from Los Angeles CA.  I've been making music for about 15 years and have worked in just about every genre there is. I spend a lot of my time producing music for other people, but over the last few years I have been making more of my own music; and am so excited to have found a space to release some of it! This is my first release on sound.xyz and i'm so happy to be here :)\n\nthis song is called Black Hole and was made with my friends Mija x Grabbitz x Choppa Dunks. It's a part of my project \"sharks!\" which is my duo with Choppa Dunks (we have some music out on spotify under \"sharks!\")\n\nwe wrote the song in February of 2021 along with a bunch of other music during that time with Mija and Grabbitz (and a lot of solo sharks!) stuff as well, so stay tuned for more collabs and singles from us soon :)",
