    "description": "When we lose someone really close to us, we ask ourselves where we are supposed to put all the love we have for them.\n\nGrief is a part of life and at one point, all of us have to embrace it; we can either run from it or learn to hold it and accept it. Grief doesn't necessarily represent our vulnerabilities, it stays inside us and it reminds us of everything we have been through. \n\nEdition : 1/1 \nDimensions: 3361 x 5042 pixels",
