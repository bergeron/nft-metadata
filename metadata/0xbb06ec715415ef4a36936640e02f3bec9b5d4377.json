    "description": "This piece, entitled 'Romeo and Juliet: The Sequel,' was created for a friend who takes comfort in death, admires Baz Luhrmann's 'Romeo and Juliet,' and has a fondness for the bizarre and uncanny, much like the works of Hieronymous Bosch. \n\nI hope you enjoy this glimpse into the unconventional and the fantastical, as we celebrate the strange and the wondrous life, love, and death.\n\nCreated exclusively with Ai image generation and Inpainting. \n\n1 of 1\n10,000 x 4,621\n(Full native resolution available: 28,564x13,200)",
