    "description": "The Eye of Amanos is a navigational tool for observing and locating all other Amanos Treasures.\n\nEvery correct combination of seed phrase gives you a peek into where each treasure is located.\n\nSadly, tool is not very functional anymore since most of the treasures often only show darkness as they are no longer used or lost. But oddly enough one of the combination takes us into outer space.\n\nI think I can find this treasure by using the position of the stars. The price you pay for the eye will budget for this exploration. That is why, I will give the treasure that I found as a gift to the owner of this eye.\n\n_\n\n\nThe Eye of Amanos is the second piece of Amanos Treasures.\n\nThe Eye of Amanos created as NFT and will be available only in the metaverse.\n\nYou can use this design in your games, videos or in any other medium if you have the ''The Eye of Amanos'' NFT.\n\nThe artist (gokka.eth) reserves the rights to use the work in his personal mediums, but cannot sell the work a second time.\n\n-",
