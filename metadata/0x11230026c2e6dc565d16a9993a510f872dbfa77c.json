    "description": "So we're back. Hexagons, am I right?\n\nWith 'One More Turn IV' we once again find ourselves studying remote islands of unusual geography. Instead of claiming individual tiles on a larger landmass, this time around we each get our own island to assemble ourselves!\n\nHere's how it all works:\n- Islands are formed of seven tiles in a honeycomb pattern.\n- Tiles have 45 potential layer states - a mix of natural and man-made features painted in meticulous detail.\n- Each layer state has a roughly 2% chance of appearing per tile.\n- There is also a small chance of bees.\n\nAll artwork is 3840x3328 pixel resolution, and 6000x5200 'originals' are available to edition owners on request.",
