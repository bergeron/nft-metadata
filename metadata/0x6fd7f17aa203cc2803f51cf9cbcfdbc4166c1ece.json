    "description": "In 2010, Digitaldubs released a concept album titled \"#1\". Originally, this was not available as CD or Vinyl (and streaming was not yet a reality). The album was released as a limited edition of 100 pieces of art made of wood and screen print, inspired by a children's block game, together with a download code for the music. \n\n12 years after, we re-edited this as a series of digital 3D renders by Jah Criss (original member of the Digitaldubs team) and art direction and concept by Marcus MPC (founder and owner of the Digitaldubs sound system).\n\nThis is the first piece: \"Numba 1\"",
