    "description": "“Some lakes run dry, sometimes, while others overflow”\n\nSome Lakes is a love song about meeting my girlfriend, Noémie in Israel. Walking down a crowded beach and swimming in the ocean together, unfazed by all the other people around, only focused on each other.  Swimming so deep into the sunset that all you can see and hear are the waves.\n\nLove is a powerful thing, and when it's present, you see everything in abundance. There’s nothing you can’t do, nothing you can't be.",
