    "description": "This is a collection of hand painted Peace symbols. \n\nArtist Statement: \n\"While the world is at unrest. We are all going through these different world and life changing events together. \nThere is still a pandemic, now a war, and all of us really just want is peace. This project is my attempt to spread a little bit of peace into the world.\" - JAY\n\nThe \"Peace\" is meant to be pushed fast and just done. Hence the concept of Pushin Peace. \n\nEvery \"Peace\" is digitally hand painted and 1/1.\n\nNo two will ever be the same and each will be unique in its own way. \n\nArtist: JAY\nLocation Created: MANHATTAN, NEW YORK\n\nMarch 13th 2022\n\nCollection: Pushin üÖøÔ∏èeace",
