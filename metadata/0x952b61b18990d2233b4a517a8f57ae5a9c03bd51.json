The general pattern of this carpet is assigned to the tomb of King Zanden in Samarkand, which is inspired by turquoise enameled and embossed tiles The design of this carpet is semi rectilinear that represents the growth of the vine or paradise grape tree in a spiral or rotational arabesque. On a soil and turquoise Mihrab the vines twine and wrap tightly around and forming beautiful frames to the light as a symbol of excellence and fertility conforming to the light fade from the dark and intense color and follow it which manifests itself in the safe sanctuary of the Mihrab The Turquoise Mihrab (Prayer Niche) carpet is 100% 155 cm which is woven in a symmetrical knot with silk warp. The field of panels is woven silk too. ",
