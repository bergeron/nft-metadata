    "description": "The Naja kaouthia leucistic (Cobra) prefers swampy habitats, but the snake can be found in grassy places and tree holes. In urban areas, the snakes prefer hiding under houses and other covered places during the day. \nIts neurotoxic venom makes this cobra so deadly that a bite can kill an adult human within an hour if a vein is hit.",
