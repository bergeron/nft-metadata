    "description": "SHADOW PEOPLE is an NFT collection by A.L. Grime founded on the idea that the collective spirit of the people that work in silence can heal visible wounds within our society. \n\nA portion of each NFT sale will be donated to charities that support organizations fighting to preserve civil liberties. At various points in the life of the project, owners will work collaboratively with the artist to select these organizations, creating a system that empowers both creator and collector to do good. \n\nCollectors will be able to participate in BURN events to receive a physical and to trigger a donation.",
