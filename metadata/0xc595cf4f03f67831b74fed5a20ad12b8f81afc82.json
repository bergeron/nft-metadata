    "description": "Slow Cycle is a celebration of all things digital-physical. It’s also a mature version of “Analog Gradients” launched on March/23 when I started experimenting with putting together printed frames and making something unique. This piece is animated using Processing, where I play around with shades of gray and random noise values. The final aesthetic is the granular texture extracted from the burned thermal paper that prints each frame. This drop consists of 75 unique frames that compound the final animated piece. Each holder will receive an airdrop with the animated GIF. I have to plans to launch physical pieces in the future. So, all holders of this and future drops will be eligible to purchase physical versions at a discounted price."
