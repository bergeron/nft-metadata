    "description": "Malicious minds cloaked in modest hearts frequently muster all their strength to combat in self-defense, and as a result, they lose the tenderness of nature that they are endowed with. This artwork is an attempt to depict the absence of true identity and real traits of human nature, as it is frequently obscured by traits that do not exist in reality. Confused, we often become pretentious and suffer from identity crisis in our attempt to validate our capabilities and morality on social media.\nIt's time to remove our masks.",
