    "description": "This is a story between two lovers lost in space trying to survive\n\nIn the year 2030 there was a ravaging pandemic that infected 80% of the worlds population. As the virus outbreak raged on the remaining few came up with plan to search the outer limits of space for a planet to call home.\n\nThe virus only known as (Dovac-016) would turn the infected into a cave man like state. The infected humans began to show a raging tendency to attack and kill the non-infected.\n\nThe remaining survivors had come up with a hyper jump system only named (ETH) once powered up would allow the explorers to jump through wormholes into other galaxies. This allowed travel through space much more easier and faster, however there is a limited supply.\n\nOnce and while a search group would be deployed back to Earth to recover the remaining  (ETH).\n\nChris & Jen met during the pandemic, as time went on their relationship grew from being survivors to long lost lovers. They endured the pandemic and found a way to survive and find the others.\n\nNow captains of the spaceship Dozer010 they are now scouring the universe in hopes to find a new world to survive.",
