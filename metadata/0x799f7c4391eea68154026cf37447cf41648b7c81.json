    "description": "What is a turtle without its shell? What is the world, if not a big shell, then, an oyster; Was it pearls you were searching for? Or did you reach so far you broke out of your sockets and yet forgot what it was you were reaching for when you struck gold? What can the gold really get you? Is it a race if you don't lift your feet to run? Are you running or merely being flung at opponents? If you are to be taken out of your way, but out of your way is where you wanted to be taken, is it truly out of your way? With your life in your own hands, or rather on your hands and knees and hyperventilating, do you feel safer if it were held in another's hands? With every breath do you feel the obligation to exhale pieces of yourself? Are you at peace? Do you want peace?",
