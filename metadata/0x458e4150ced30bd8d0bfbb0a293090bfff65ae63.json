    "description": "Hi Sound! My name is demotapes, I’m a producer and artist based in San Francisco. I’m also in a duo called Cassette Tapes, and I started the demotapes project at the beginning of 2020. This is my first drop on sound, thank you for being here :) \n\nLiving in San Francisco, I often feel like an outsider in the music industry. This is something that I embrace- I feel like this isolation helps me to feel creatively free. 2022 was the most creative year of my life, and the biggest shift for me was getting back to writing music with my friends- even if it was over discord calls. Creating memories and shared experiences around songs helped me fall back in love with the creative process and connect with the music in a way that I never have before. \n\nI wrote this song in San Francisco with my friend Sam (pluko). He came to visit me and we spent a few days just creating in my basement studio. The bulk of the song came together in a single day- the idea just sort of poured out of us. To me, this song feels like the perfect embodiment of what it’s like to create art with your friends- it’s hopeful, nostalgic and fun. I hope you guys love it too <3 ",
