    "description": "The *TimeSync* series focusses on one of photography’s greatest strengths - capturing moments in time - and takes it to the next level. This photograph evolves in the course of a day based on the viewer’s local time and therefore is blending a full day into one NFT. **Smoky Mountain** is the second piece in this collection. \n\n You can't reach Argentina's beautiful mountain village El Chalten without a 4 hour drive. The last few hours on Ruta Provincial (RP)23, however, are passing by in the blink of an eye. Reason is that they are accompanied by the majestic views of El Chalten's namesake mountain. 'Chaltén' means smoky mountain in the Aonikenk language of the ancient Tehuelche people. Seeing and capturing it as cloud-free as this over a course of 24 hours is a very rare and equally magnificent sight. Bringing those moments back to life is the goal of this second piece in the *TimeSync* series \n\n [Click for Fullscreen](https://timesync.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQuDkwC7iWwcNpvWJqXtyHXQ6yNFbjhtrMhwbkHcd9jHP/Chalten-Timesync.html)",
