    "description": "Have you ever been fascinated by time? There are some unanswered questions concerning time and its history that keeps me pondering. What is our perception of time? Is time only a concept in our minds? Is time an experience? Simply wondering is fascinating. We humans constitute a significant portion of time. Humans, to me, are beautiful creatures that resemble celestial bodies. Within our tiny, inquisitive minds, we are capable of tracking time and discovering anything even the cosmos. It's fascinating to think that our brain, despite its physical size, has the ability to open up new doors of possibilities. Even the passage of time is written on our faces. Wrinkles and wounds tell a lot about how far we've come; it tells a story, a memory. \n\n ",
