    "description": "Escape into a world of daydreams with this captivating black-and-white digital inking artwork by Pablo Stanley. A young and imaginative character takes center stage, slowly wandering with a sense of wonder and no specific destination.\n\nThe character is adorned with a backpack and a sword, symbols of their adventurous spirit, yet they move with a dreamy, slow pace. Despite the robotic enhancements in their head and prosthetic leg, this protagonist is consumed by their thoughts and the endless possibilities of their imagination.\n\nThis artwork captures the beauty of letting your mind wander and embracing the power of daydreaming.\n\nDreamer by Pablo Stanley is the 2nd Audio Galleries Artist Edition.",
