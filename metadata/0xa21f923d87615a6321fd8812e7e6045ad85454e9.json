    "description": "5 ORBS is a digital moiré animation that is part of a series of animated optical patterns created from geometric shapes and motifs. Its geometry is informed by optical and kinetic art of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the works of Jesús Rafael Soto and Victor Vasarely. The ORBS series is also influenced by science fiction book covers from the collection “Ailleurs et Demain” (Elsewhere and Tomorrow) published in France in 1969.",
