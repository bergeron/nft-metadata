    "description": "In the same vein as \"u&i\", this song is about the struggles of a relationship between two people wanting to fight for each other, but not being be able to fight for the right reasons at the right time. I've experienced this many times before, both sides, being the fighter and the person that someone is fighting for. \n\nEach side has things that are hard to handle and even harder to do, but this song is from the perspective of a fighter who wants to be fought for, while simultaneously understanding that sometimes a fight isn't necessary.\n\nIn writing this song, this description and just in general, I've realised that the word \"fight\" is one often associated with negativity, with pain, survival and violence, be it towards others, or yourself. But I choose to see it in the light I want it to be in, which is trying your best to make sure the reality you want, with someone you love, can come to life with enough effort, time, patience and fight.",
