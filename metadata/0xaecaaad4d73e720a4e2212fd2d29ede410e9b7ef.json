    "description": "Another way of saying children in Jamaica is “pickney”, a word I grew up hearing often from my aunt Marcia whenever she would yell at me and my siblings or cousins for giving trouble. This painting depicts my cousins and two of my sisters during a visit to St. Elizabeth in Jamaica circa 1995 I assume. ",
