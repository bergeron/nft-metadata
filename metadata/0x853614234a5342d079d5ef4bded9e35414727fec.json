    "description": "During my southern Taiwan exploration I visited this beautiful temple of Kaohsiung city. It is located in the Lotus Pond in the Zuoying District.\n\nConsidered to be among the most interesting attractions of the district, the artificial pond on which it is located was built in 1951, and soon after, in 1976 the two temples were built too. Both of the towers have seven floors which have yellow walls, red pillars and orange tiles, and they are connected with the lake’s shore by a zigzag bridge.\n\nWith the great importance the dragon and the tiger hold in the traditional Kaohsiung culture, it is always recommended for the visitors to enter through the dragon’s mouth and come out from the tiger’s mouth, in order to be able to get rid of the bad luck and turn it into a good one.\n\nHowever we decided to do something even better. Me and my wife laid down there for this top down shot of this gorgeous place. \n\n1:1 Edition\nDimentions : 3567 × 4459",
