    "description": "The year 2022 has been one for the books. With all the weight carried in the web 3 space as the year draws to a close, Cypher and the ENCRYPTAS team have thought to simplify all this weight and root it back down to the core of NFTs; the art. \n\nThe faceless ENCRYPTAS will always serve as a symbol of decentralization. This ENCRYPTMAS, Cypher invites everyone in the space to reflect on what Decentralization means to them, and to find hope in what Crypto can bring to future generations of girls and women.\n\nWelcoming current community members and new ones to celebrate the triumphs and trials of this past year with a vibrant, colorful and to the roots ENCRYPTAS. These special edition ENCRYPTAS are Cypher's flowers to the amazing community who continues to blossom and flourish, and to act as an invitation for those new to web 3 to interact with this space through the collection of their first NFT.",
