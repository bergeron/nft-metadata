    "description": "By guiding neural networks and curating the outcome, I interrogate the boundaries between photography and classical and contemporary art forms | original creation date: January 24, 2023\n\nAbout the artist\n\nWith a background in special effects, 3D animation, video games, and photography, Bas Uterwijk, aka Ganbrood, has always been involved in forms of visual storytelling that imitate and distort reality. Since 2019 he combined his different skills and experiences when he started working with generative adversarial networks (GANs): Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence based software that interprets and synthesizes photographs.  \nHis work is characterized by \"pseudo-figurative\" works that tend to disrupt human visual recognition, and for which he uses neural networks as a synthetic muse.",
