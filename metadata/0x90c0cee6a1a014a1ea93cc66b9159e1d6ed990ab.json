    "description": "This artwork started out as a line drawing of the Central Business District in Beijing.\n\nI was especially interested in the angles and layout of the area and the dynamic appearance of the CCTV headquarters and the drawing quickly took on a semi-abstract quality.\n\nI decided to colour this artwork and to include a vignette of the Hall of Mental Cultivation - a building in the Forbidden City - as a reference to the historical area of Beijing.\n\nThis artwork prints at 50cm x 70cm and purchase of this NFT on primary comes with a signed giclee print of the artwork which is shipped worldwide (according to current shipping rules and regulations).\n\nThis is the first in a series of artworks that aim to represent different aspects of well known cities within a single image.",
