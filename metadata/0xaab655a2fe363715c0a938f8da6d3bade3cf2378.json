    "description": "\"Fresh Air\" is the freedom and relief that arises when you speak your needs. The same tears and unbearable sadness I was feeling the day I wrote this song led me back to myself, to my core needs. What makes me feel grounded and free. I spent the rest of the day at a festival on the lakefront.\n\n I'm a fire starter, phoenix, lioness, and alchemist with my head so focused on the victory that I'm learning to allow my heart the space it needs to just shed in the moment. Yes I am strong, but these days I have been leaning into my softness, my gentle era, and yearning for ease. \n\nWhen we keep telling ourselves the same stories about love, success, friendship, society, relationships, and one another we can create blockages that bind us to the same endings. I no longer believe that I am asking too much and I know that god, the universe, the earth has already provided so much. We have everything we need. I want everyone who listens to this song to feel like giving and receiving good love is possible. \n\nThe heartbeat of the song is New Orleans Second Line drum meets afrobeat (produced by She is the Future collaborator and native son of New Orleans Infinite Eye) featuring the lyrical and vintage visual art stylings of Old Orleans. The soul of the song is nostalgic groove inspired and shaped by Head of Production and Engineering at Creative Minds Coalition, Ashton Woods. Detroit Soul Okkk Motown okkk not to mention the song feats. buttery backing vocals from the Cameroonian Detroit legend Scolla Fungwe as well as my three year old daughter Mecca Selah, no but fr, she was feeling it and it's giving light at the end of the tunnel.  \n\n\n\n\n",
