    "description": "Beginning with the intent to reflect these women’s realities and finding expression in practitioners of widely differing outlooks and goals. Creating these kind of scenes acquire an aura by being taken from their casual, often overlooked, position and put under intense scrutiny. The outcome intent tool which should look upon my collection dispassionately is capable of creating images, filtered through the imagination, which compellingly engage the viewer’s imagination and emotions. It wasn’t empathy, It wasn’t sympathy, it was more of a forced, intrinsic, and integral self-reflection.",
