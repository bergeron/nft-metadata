    "description": "Ilford RC Deluxe Ilfospeed IS3.44M Pearl photo paper, non fixed, one drop of developer fluid, 1/25            Each Blacksquare is only one of 25 pieces of an edition (one motif). For each edition, a negative is first created and then exposed on light-sensitive photographic paper.             This positive is not fixed and will continue to develop with further exposure to sunlight. Each Edition is divided into 25 squares, and each square is sprinkled by hand with a drop of developer fluid.             The impact of each drop, destroys and blackens the affected areas, turning every positive square into a Blacksquare.             This process of destruction is recorded and then stored on the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS).             The information is now hidden beneath blackness. Only you can illuminate the blacksquares and trigger the videos to play.",
