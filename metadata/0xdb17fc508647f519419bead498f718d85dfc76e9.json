    "description": "Red color is a symbol of bravery and courage. Just like this artwork is Masha's first brave step into the NFT world. \nRed means feast and joy. As well as Masha's natural cheer, huge enthusiasm, childlike spirit  and fun sparkles inside her. \nRed is a color of passion and love. They are essential ingredients of Masha's each creation.\nRed color is a symbol of life. What can be more precious than the life itself? This is a great gift we all need to take care of and truly enjoy it! \n\nMotion effect makes the artwork alive.\nGentle waves of music give the opportunity to feel the artwork, to dive into the state of meditation and contemplation.\n\nMasha wants RED to please your eyes, your ears and the main part - your soul! \n\nRED's format-MP4. Made in Adobe After Effects: motion & music effects were added on the photo. \nThe photo was made at the backstage of the Moscow Fashion Week  in 2019. The effect on the photo isn't Photoshop, it's a long exposure.\nMusic: Freesound.org, Listen by Andrewkn.\n",
