    "description": "Rugs from Kerman were once considered to be the best of Persian carpet production. Now a day these Persian carpets are still in the highest class of hand-knotted carpets. The dominant color of Kerman rugs is usually vivid red, which unleashes its full intensity in combination with tones like beige. In addition, there is often a medallion in the middle of the carpets, which is framed by playful floral patterns. Thus, the design gives a colorful life to the carpet.",
