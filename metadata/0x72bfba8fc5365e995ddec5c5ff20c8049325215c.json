    "description": "In life, we make the conscious choice to define the duration, scope, and mood of any “Journey”. These distances traveled can be in our minds, souls, and…most importantly…our imagination. Regardless of your destination, it’s that in-between time that always carries the most uncertainty. What moments in your life have you felt this mysterious jaunt of doubt? Was there a conclusion? Does it even matter?\n\nThe “Journey” series was crafted entirely inside the GLSL Shader Language using a technique called Raymarching. This process can be quite harrowing at times, but can lead to gorgeous and interesting results. The process of which feels more like a collaboration between the creator and the ancient language of mathematics. Renders can become almost infinite in detail and scale. As it’s been said, “The process is the product.”\n\nMath was used to create this piece, no 2D or 3D software was used.\n\nRendered out at 4k resolution at 60fps.",
