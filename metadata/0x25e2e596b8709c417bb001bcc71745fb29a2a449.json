    "description": "I was lost, night was falling in the distance, a thin pinkish ribbon marked the end\nthe end of a hot August day. The cold air currents were injecting themselves into the hot plain. The roar of the storm echoed over my head. I was alone. I had to leave. Something deep inside\nof me was pushing me to take the plunge. Porto? First destination, a plane ticket, one way. When I was young, I always wanted to discover this city.",
