    "description": "This is 1 NFT in a collection of 10 photographs that have been issued as a single, unique edition.\n\nPhoto: 5607 x 7000 px\n\nIceland was on my bucket list for many years. And first of all, because I've never seen the Northern lights in my life. I remember the moment when it happened.\n\nWe were driving along the night road when something white appeared in the sky. I looked up and thought, \"Is that a cloud?\"\n\nIt seems that there is a wisp of white waving. We start to stare at it and it begins to grow and take shape. Then the white changes to green. \n\nBands of light dance in front of us and stretch across the skies. The most common lights are green but we were really fortunate, and saw waves of purple and blue as well. The whole sky were dancing in colors and it almost seems to be putting on a show, just for us. \n\nAfter a few shots, I stopped and just stare in amazement. There is no better way to describe the northern lights than pure magic.",
