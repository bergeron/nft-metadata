    "description": "In this body of work, I explore the feeling of solitude and isolation within the bustle of the city. Through minimalistic compositions and the use of light and shadow, I attempt to depict the stark contrast between emptiness and overcrowding, and the sense of peace and tranquility that can be found in quiet moments of solitude. These pieces invite reflection on the beauty and meaning of being alone in a world that is constantly buzzing with activity.\n\nbosh. 12.28.22.",
