    "description": "A landscape generated from a phrase overheard out-of-context in Los Angeles in 2022. Hundreds of thousands of minuscule particles are carefully placed in regular shapes atop the imaginary topology, and then set free to avalanche down figmentary slopes and crevices. The landscape itself is ethereal, and only visible when and where it affects the flow of particles.",
