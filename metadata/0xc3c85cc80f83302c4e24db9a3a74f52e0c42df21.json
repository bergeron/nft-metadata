    "description": "boring women's war in the mage's world. Melanie plunged into alchemy, took her son and bought a manor outside the town to live in, and never saw her husband again.\n\n\n\nUntil she was 12, Hill only saw this so-called father at the annual New Year's dinner. Unfortunately, when he was 12 years old, Melanie's alchemy failed, and her spell backburned. She died a few months later, forcing Hill to return to Earl's Castle.\n\n",
