    "description": "The NFT EP is an audiovisual NFT collection created and curated by ergogh.eth, Love, riskybeats, and Lil 91, based on 3 songs created by ergogh.eth, riskybeats, and Lil 91. Each song is paired with 1 of 451 unique covers arts individually crafted by ergogh.eth, using assets owned by the Team, CC0 works, and works in the public domain. There are 101 editions with At Least Iâ€™m Alive (Uber), 150 with Bones, 200 with Big Smile. This project was made with Love. Three special holders will receive 1 of 1 merchandise of their 1 of 1 art. Winners will be determined via lottery after mint-out. Purchase of these audiovisual NFTs does not grant holders any commercial to any of the underlying assets used to create the audiovisual NFT work. Holders do have commercial rights to the unique, one-of-one visual artwork that is one aspect of the audiovisual NFT as a whole, but only as to the visual artwork as a whole, not in part.
