    "description": "The path of destruction and love. Truth is important, the path to the\ntruth also has obstacles, getting lost is normal; It is difficult to\nimagine life without it being by your side but I am sure of something,\nthe light is near. The fire of your soul motivates you, it directs you\nto power, balance, passion and goodness; there will also be\ndisappointment, anger, rage, sadness, repentance... a lot of\nrepentance but acceptance of change, in life there are changes that\none does not expect, there will be fear of not doing the right thing,\nof not repeating what was lived in Every morning at the same time with\nthat beautiful smile that fills your soul with energy and by your side\nyou have the love of your life that will never fail you with a cup of\ncoffee every morning. Att: the fire of your gaze.",
