    "description": "Mom and dad,\n\nYou left without saying a word. Growing up, it was very hard for me to face the reality that both of you are happy without me. When I was in school, I remember having these gold medals in my hands yet I came home with a frown. When I was in the peak of my teenage years, I remember having these bouquets of flowers yet I still felt unloved. Both of you created a void that nobody could ever fulfill because you - you are irreplaceable. And when I had my first lover, when he left, it was okay because you know what I said?\n\nMy dad broke my heart before you did.\n\n\nBut mom, dad, thank you for leaving because I learned to be strong, to be mature way beyond my age, I learned to stand up for myself.\n\nI had to. \n\n\nSo now, hereâ€™s your little flower, blooming, growing and shining without you. \n\nThank you for inspiring me. \n\nInspiring me to be nothing like you.",
