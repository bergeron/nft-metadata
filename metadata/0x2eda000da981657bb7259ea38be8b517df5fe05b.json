    "description": "Generated animation 20min\n4k resolution\n2021\n\nAs the world begins to emerge out of a global pandemic that has disrupted and transformed our everyday lives, mental health and well-being are now recognized as crucial self-care\npractices for everyone.\n \nContinuum is a meditative generated animation by Krista Kim in collaboration with Efren Mur.  It will be featured in Toronto to bring healing and wellness to the community. In a symbolic act of healing and rebirth, the work will be installed at Fort York National Historic Site, transforming it from a military fortification implicated in colonial history into a light of hope for the future. \n \nWith original music composed and performed live by Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Continuum features a free-standing video wall measuring 100 ft. long along the original lakeshore lines of Lake Ontario paired with immersive healing sound frequencies, Continuum is the largest sound and light installation in Toronto’s Fort York History. \n \nVisitors will be invited to participate at their own socially distant leisure throughout the 4 day experience.\n \nFor the Sotheby’s curated by Steve Aoki, we are offering Continuum as a 20 min., 1/1 NFT.  Proceeds will support the Continuum Foundation, which supports the Continuum World Tour.  \n",
