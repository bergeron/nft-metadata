    "description": "Created by an AI text prompt, The Turning Point NFTs are the outcome of logical input and waiting for a response from the unknown. \n\nThis activity is like authoring a question for the I Ching and divining a response. And much like divining the I Ching, when using AI for image generation, you expect a pleasing outcome.\n\nWhen looking at the images in the Turning point, you can find yourself wanting a different shape. It's like looking for the perfect seashell on the beach, or the perfect profile picture.\n\nHow committed can we be to living with what comes next? If you knew you could only keep one, can you close your eyes and pick, and a commit to whatever outcome unfolds?",
