    "description": "This is a still from a live performance I gave at Grace Exhibition Space in NYC for the very first performance night.  I created this piece in 2006 and there is still this amazing write up floating around about it by Alex Codlin  in it she speaks about this performance: \" Although Johnny My Love is the beginning of a new direction in her work that is no longer beholden to the past, Amelia’s experiences are and will always be evident in her art, the choices she makes, and the issues that she address just by her being who she is. From her unique vantage point as a Native person, she sees the Native community in America as a living record of what happens when the US takes on the role of the aggressor. She compares American attempts to bring democracy and self-sufficiency ...as a contemporary successor to early settlers’ efforts to “civilize” the Indians.. \"",
