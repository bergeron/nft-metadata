    "description": "\"Summer Lovin'\" is my genesis NFT photography collection. It is a special body of work that I made during the summers of 2017 through 2019.\n\nEach of these images began with a candid exploration until eye contact was made and a conversation ensued. \n\nMy Summer Lovin’ series focuses on the love shared between couples. I chose to photograph couples at two distinct beaches in the largest cities in America - New York City’s Coney Island Beach in Brooklyn and Venice Beach in Los Angeles.  \n\n\"Summer Lovin' - 01\" is my favorite photograph I have ever made.",
