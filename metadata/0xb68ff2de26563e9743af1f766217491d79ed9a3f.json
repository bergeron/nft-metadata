    "description": "\"Girl with a Clown Nose,\" or as I like to call it, \"Circus Chic.\" Taking a classic portrait and adding a touch of fun and whimsy with the addition of a bright red clown nose. Who needs pearls when you can have a squeaky red nose, right? The girl's expression is a perfect mix of mystery and mischief as if she's about to tell you a hilarious joke or pull a silly prank on you.",
