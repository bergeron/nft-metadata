    "description": "\n3D Object - Turn, Move and Zoom the Frame.\n\nHindus consider the Vedas to be \"apauruṣeya\", which means \"not of a man, superhuman\", revelations of sacred sounds and texts heard by ancient sages after intense meditation.\n\nSamaveda is the Veda of melodies and chants. It is an ancient Vedic Sanskrit text, and part of the scriptures of Hinduism. One of the four Vedas, it is a liturgical text which consists of 1,875 verses.\n\nThe Samaveda frame was specifically designed for [Archan Nair's](https://superrare.com/archannair) artworks [Chryseis](https://opensea.io/collection/chryseis) and Prana. Like Chryseis, Samaveda #1/10 is a 10/10 edition. It gives Chryseis space, but also boundaries while allowing it to live. It pays tribute to Archans’ brilliant art, cultural heritage, and the frame as a unique piece of art.\n\nExperience Samaveda #1/10 in our [3D Gallery](https://frahm.generativeartist.com/campaigns/archan/?preset=12&campaignLogo=/campaigns/archan/1_Chryseis.png).\n\nPlease note: Frahm is about frames.
