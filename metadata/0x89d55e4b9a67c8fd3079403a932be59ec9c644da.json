    "description": "Scarlett suffered from severe depression and nobody could help her. She was always crying and had a constant sorrow in her heart. One day, she saw a mushroom hat on her head. Since that day, this mushroom was always with her, and whenever Scarlett needed support and cried, her tears turned into stars. The stars that shed from her eyes brought her peace.\nThis piece of me and my sister is a combination of AI and digital painting.\n",
