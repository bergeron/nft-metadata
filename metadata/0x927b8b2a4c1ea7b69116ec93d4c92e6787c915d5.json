    "description": "2970 × 2969 jpeg\n\n We are now in a period of great change in our lives that is rare in recent years, and we are being forced to rethink the way we have been casually going about our daily lives and to renew our values in a new way.The map of value is being constantly rewritten as things and people move and change in complex and dizzying ways according to highs and lows, coarseness and density, large and small, and so on.\n\n In my work, I place various colors and shapes on a flat surface while constantly judging the value of each individual object, and consider the beauty of the indefinite relationships that can be created from the variation of objects that are not equivalent values. 　When one tries to treat things that cannot be equivalent in value as equivalent, a rearrangement of values takes place.\n I aim to create a visual art to recognize the unequal distribution of values in the current world.",
