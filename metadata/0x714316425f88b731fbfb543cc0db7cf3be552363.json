    "description": "“Fallen” is a piece that stemmed from feeling lost and disappointed from a relationship. Sometimes speaking from your heart doesn’t get well received by others acting through their ego. It can even make you feel like you’re falling.\n\nFallen angels can be described as people who rebel and go against a higher being, but deep down fallen angels are really just lost souls. Often misunderstood, these angels are seen as the antagonist in the story for just trying to get their needs met. This piece shows that these angels can still fall with beauty and grace despite all that has been thrown at them.",
