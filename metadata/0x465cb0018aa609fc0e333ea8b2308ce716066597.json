    "description": "Pepe was created by Matt Furie in 2005, first appearing in comic \"Boy's Club\". Ever since it was adopted and used by numerous communities. It is also one of the first images on blockchain with the appearance of \"Rare Pepes\" in 2014.\n\n\nStill relevant as ever, it is the ultimate \"meme\" for many of us.\n\n\nI wanted to pay homage to Pepe and all the artists that still imagine and recreate this timeless friend of ours.\n\n\nYou are invited to visit the Temple of Pepe.\n\n\nALL HAIL PEPE",
