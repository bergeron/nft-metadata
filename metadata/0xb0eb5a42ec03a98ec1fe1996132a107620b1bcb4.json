    "description": "Cityscapes are more than the visual appearance of a city or urban area. They are also more than an artistic representation of the physical aspects of an urban area or cities.\n\nWhat do you associate with cityscapes?\n\nThis art series is inspired by neo-expressionism and urban art, but also by pop art. The style could best be described with the term “new urban expressionism”.\n\nCreated in collaboration between human and AI.\n6850 x 5382 pixels, png-file by RayZ Multiverse x AI, 2022",
