    "description": "A day after returning to my home in Zanjan, I encountered some colorful buildings in the entrance of the city that were built by the government for the lower class of the society and felt like seeing those colorful mountains again but this time with windows! It was at that moment that I told myself what a great idea!\nThen I started taking photos of these buildings and matching them with the colors of mountains. After around 5 months, this series was formed.\nWhile reading an article, I was introduced to a historian and philosopher called (Mircea Eliade) and used parts of his theories on the creation of the universe in my statement:\n\"creation of the universe is the prototype of any other buildings. Every new city and new house that is built, can be seen as a new imitation of the formation of the universe and in some sense, repeating the creation.\"\n",
