    "description": "Me and her, Mia, We have known and been together since high school. She sat in front of me on the left. We read together in class, played volleyball after class, went shopping and played games on weekends, especially tried the new flavor of ice cream in the cafe downstairs my condo.         We were innocent, we were naive, and high-spirited back then. In the summer, my classmates went to the beach together for graduated vacation, and I dyed her red hair, with her together. She was chewing gum and playing in the sand. Suddenly she looked at me with a smile, still pinning the two small hairpins I gave her. At this time, the scorching sun is in the sky, and my heart is as hot as that.         The scene freezes at this moment. This is youth, me and her, we r youth also.",
