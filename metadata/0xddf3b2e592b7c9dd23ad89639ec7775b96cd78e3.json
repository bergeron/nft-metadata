    "description": "This artwork represents the energy that flows through each of us. The waves and currents in our bodies, that fuel us to create, to live and express our true selves.\n\nI live with Mitochondrial disease , an energy disease. My energy is an extremely precious resource, so I must be careful when choosing how to expend it. Creating art through my photography, has always been a worthy practice in which to use my body's resources. In turn it is my therapy, and a large part of how I get through each day.\n\nThrough compositing my light painting photographs (a series of long exposure photographs combined with the manipulation of light painting tools), and a layer of Rik Oostenbroek's 'Self' artwork, I've portrayed this ebb and flow of energy.",
