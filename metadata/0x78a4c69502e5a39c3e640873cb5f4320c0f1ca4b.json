    "description": "The battle between the lion and the bull in the Gerefto Gir motifs can be considered the ancient myth of the Mihr's battle (The Sun) with the bull and tearing it apart for bringing blessings, which is the main subject in Mihr paintings.\nIn these examples, the lion is also a symbol of the power, glory of royalty and majesty of kings.\nThe battle between the lion and the bull can be seen as a symbol of confrontation, fight, and the victory of spring equinox over winter cold, as well as the arrival of the New Year and Nowruz.\nIn the Mithraic religion, Mihr kills the bull. In fact, the Sun kills the bull for creating plants and giving the blessing.",
