    "description": "The artist is not a fish in a glass jar.\nSometimes it feels like I'm stifling myself, like I'm not allowing myself to fully express what's in my heart. But then I remind myself that restraint is not a weakness, but a strength. It's a sign of maturity and control, a way of channeling my emotions and creating something that is both powerful and meaningful.\n\nAnd in the end, I know that my restraint is what makes my art truly special. It's what sets it apart from the work of those who let their emotions run wild without any thought for the consequences. It's what gives my art its depth and its resonance, its ability to connect with others on a deep and meaningful level.",
