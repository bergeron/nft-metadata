    "description": "Four years ago, two friends and I started a trip to see South America.\nWe had always wanted to get to know Argentina and the countries around it, so we packed our bags and started the adventure.\nThis is in La Salina Grande, Jujuy.\nThe Salinas Grandes are large salt flats of 212 km2 in extension located in Puna, at 3,450 meters above sea level.\nAn extension of white salt that contrasts with the blue of the sky. Natural and unique environment.\nI hope you can enjoy it as much as we did.",
