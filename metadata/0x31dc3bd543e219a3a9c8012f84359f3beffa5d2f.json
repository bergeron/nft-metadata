    "description": "Robert Young | Hong Kong | 2008\n\n\"Arriving in Hong Kong in 2008 was a dream come true. I never met my grandfather but always wondered about his homeland. I was finally getting to see it first hand. It was simply incredible!\n\nOn August 25, 2008, I took an escalator ride on the 'Centralâ€“Mid-Levels Escalator,' the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world. After only traveling about halfway up, I got off, walked along a path and came across the vision that would become \"First Click.\" \n\nI had purchased a DSLR camera to master composition for my film work, but as I looked down at the digital display, I saw something I had not seen before in my images... I saw a work of art. \n\n'First Click' was born. \n\nIt's only fitting, 14 years later, that my first digital fine art photograph is now my first minted NFT.\" Robert Young",
