    "description": "A skull floats within a fictional panorama and appears as a paradox of being alive in life, the image swings from one side to the other like a pendulum, traveling from the moment of death to the moment of rebirth, fleetingly passing through that just present where existence is manifested.\n\nIt is an ambiguous moment, it is the portrait of the state of astonishment that occurs in the face of what has suddenly changed in one in a cyclical, successive and irremediable time.\n\nA Post Neanderthal falls and rises again in the middle of three moments that in short are a single time.\n\nA reminder of the impossibility of escaping the course of time and destiny, a prayer to that god who is a machine why it was forgotten that the possibility of living exists in emitting light and ascending when fire fills everything.\n\n\n\nTitle: Deus ex machina, a rising meteor\n\nCollection: Deus ex machina\nEncompassing painting\nArt 1 of 1\n4600 X 5978 px / 300 PPI\nPNG\n47.6 MB",
