    "description": "Mandy, Alies, Rebecca, Wanda, and Sugar. Five ladies, five characters, and 2447 exciting NFTs. As contrasting as their characters are, so is the drawing technique behind them. The combination of airbrushes, vector graphics, and photo collages makes the Take Two Pop Art collection special. The bright colors and the Five Different Ladies result in 20,250 possible combinations. Of these, 2222 images and 225 exclusive videos can be minted. Which videos are you wondering? Each exclusive video includes another 180 ladies that you can play at will. So, with a bit of luck, you'll take far more than two ladies.",
