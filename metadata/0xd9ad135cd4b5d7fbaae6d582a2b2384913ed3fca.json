    "description": "On August 10, 2021, I took the leap and flew to Mexico without a return ticket. I had just graduated, moved out of my old apartment, sold most of my belongings, and committed myself to making my dreams come true. What was planned as a three-month internship turned into a year of diving, traveling and personal growth. For five months, I lived in Mexico, diving almost every day in the Caribbean. But there was something that absolutely blew me away: the cenotes of Mexico. I lost my whole heart to diving and being able to dive there and enjoy the experience to the fullest completely changed my life. I realized how passionate I was about the ocean, diving and the underwater world. Within a year, so many opportunities opened up to me, and I wouldn't be where I am now if I hadn't followed my heart. 200 bar stands for the maximum air pressure in standard-sized scuba tanks that you normally start a dive with in recreational diving.",
