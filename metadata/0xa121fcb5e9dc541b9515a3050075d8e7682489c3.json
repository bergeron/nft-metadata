    "description": "Two Hopi girls at the edge of the Grand Canyon after dancing the Supai, a social dance honoring the Supai tribe, who have lived at the bottom of the canyon for at least the past 800 years. Only unwed Hopi girls participate in social dances.\n\nThe Hopi consider the canyon their birthplace. They were known to emerge into their Sípàapuni (Fourth World), from Ongtupqa (the Grand Canyon).\n\n* * *\n\nLight of the Hopi is a collaboration between photographer Erika Rand and members of the Hopi tribe. Historically the tribe has rarely been photographed. 50% of proceeds from sales of NFTs and photographic prints go to the cultural groups, individuals, or villages photographed.",
