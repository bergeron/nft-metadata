    "name": "Silk Road – Wonderland",
    "description": "Silk Road was indeed a truly surreal experience.\nWe can see the main subject, the famous fictional character known as Dread Pirate Roberts, riding his golden camel through a desert full of buried skyscrapers. The artwork shows his entrance into Wonderland, with a melted red pill as a landmark, referencing The Matrix. This symbol of freedom that comes at a cost is marking a point of no return for him. Entering full of confidence into this new realm, DPR has his head above the clouds, symbolizing that once reaching that high one can easily get lost. With a cloudy judgement but always on duty, he is trying to provide for his followers with everything they’ve ever imagined. Slowly moving on this windy and dangerous path, our hero’s inherited identity came with great responsibilities and his mask is trying to show us that though its long and tangled tail. \nSilk Road was never about the actual things available for purchase but about the freedom of choice.",
