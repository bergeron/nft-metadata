    "description": "Who am I within this collective?\nIs an unlit light still a light bulb?\nIs a broken rock still a rock?\nHow to name what distorts traditional programming?\nHack our drives, genetically programmed, compulsive, inherited.\nThe break is a time frame.\nIt occurs when matter does not fit in a body that wanders towards yours route.\nIn firm steps there is also imbalance. It takes courage, whatever the landscape.\nIn this game of concepts, the compositions embrace each other outlining the colored geometry. The figures that live in the head for a long time; months, sometimes years, tell things that were not yet in the superficial layer of the rational.\n\n3000x2000\n\nThe first owner will receive a framed poster sized artwork and a NFT avatar inspired by this scene to be released on Opensea in 2022. Additionally, access to whitelist of planned exclusive fashion items inspired by my NFT works. \n",
