    "description": "Today I caught a fairy\nfalling from the sky\n’cause I first thought\nit was a butterfly\n\nYet when I looked\ndown in my hand\nthe vision that I saw\nwas hard to understand\n\nAnd I said to her\n“Fairy, please don’t die\nfor if you really do\nI think I would cry!”\n\nI didn’t believe in magic\nand all that kinda thing\nalthough one day I thought\nI heard the angels sing\n\nThen butterflies came in\nand hovered all around\nuntil that tiny fairy\nbegan to make a sound\n\nAs she was stirring\nshe looked up at me\nthe fear on her face\nI could plainly see\n\nThen she jumped up\nand quickly flew away\nso I believe in fairies\nwhat else can I say?\n\nTeresa Marie  ",
