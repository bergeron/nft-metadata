    "description": "\"The cold water and black sky are all my body can feel right now. But the land will redeem all this. It has to. By the time I set foot on that earth, nothing else will matter.\"\n\nVLTRAMARINI, or “those beyond the sea,” now stands in as a moment in-between, continuing to expand the MARE MAGNVM world. The collection is made up of 15 unique images that show the passengers arriving at a coastline. Seen altogether, the works form a sprawling panorama of their landfall. This moment, fraught with danger but still teeming with triumph, is fractured, indicating the variety of perspectives tied into the same event. Each image provides a view of the Vltramarini as their ocean voyage ends and a new leg of their quest begins.",
