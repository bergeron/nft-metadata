    "description": "This is my genesis piece on Foundation. I have been watching for the sidelines for such a long time, admiring  the artists who took the plunge. I started with little a little money and I bought my first Tezos to be able to mint on Objkt. After some sales, I was able to make enough that I could convert my earnings into ETH so that I may mint my first piece on Ethereum. \nI love glitch art and I admire those who can create masterpieces with them. I want to remain anonymous and I have a fascination with rats and rodents, particularly because  RAT is an anagram for ART. Hopefully, someone out there can vibe with my vision of glitch photography and feel my intentions with my genesis piece.",
