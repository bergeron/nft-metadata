    "description": "The troubled mind is the first woman born in my mind. He lives in a small town hidden in pain and darkness. His body is covered in blood. Be full\nAnger and rape bother him, which is why he lives in a dark place or closes his eyes when the men of the city shout, even if his eyes are beautiful with black streaks.\nHe is usually alone, but in the evenings he was reading books, blood and fiery wounds swirling around his beautiful and radiant body.",
