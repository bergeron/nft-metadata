    "description": "These photos were inspired by russian folklore and russian fairytales.\nIn the middle of the story there's often a female protagonist, who is in the dark and gloomy forest, trying to find her way to her goal, or to her loved one.\nWe tried to show through that the feeling of being alone, by yourself, is normal, and you can use being alone to find more about yourself.",
