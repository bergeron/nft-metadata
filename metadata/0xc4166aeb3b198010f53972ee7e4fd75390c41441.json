    "description": "You know, I can’t be alone , I get eaten up by thoughts for a moment, I want to be empty sometimes , not to think, but that’s impossible, that hypersensitivity to the world around me is my destiny. The only time I can relax is when my thoughts flow into painting. Yes, these lines are literally my thoughts, if you can read them, then we understand me and you won’t have questions about what I’m drawing. These lines I called \"milk thoughts\" but I’ll tell you about that later.",
