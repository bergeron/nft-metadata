    "description": "Even nature supports Ukrainians in their Resistance.\nMy cosmic succulents stood up for the defense of their native Ukraine. Every year, in summertime, they produce inflorescences. But this summer, instead of flowers, they armed themselves with Tridents.\nThe Trident has many interpretations. One of them - is a symbol of state power. Other - a bow with arrows. Or a sharp sword instead of a prong. The Trident is also associated with runes. It is also an attribute of the gods Perun, Neptune, Poseidon, Vishnu and Shiva.\nThe Trident is the Ukrainian national symbol, the modern coat of arms of Ukraine and of Kyivan Rus.\nIt was depicted on coins, swords, work tools, in manuscripts, on the stones of churches, castles.\nThe Trident was also used as a symbolic sign in Ukrainian folklore and church heraldry.\nPolitical repression in the USSR persecuted Trident.\nSo today The Trident represents for Ukrainians a weapon. A powerful, invincible and blessed weapon designed to destroy the enemy.",
