    "description": "You're trick or treating and see a bowl of candy outside the door with a sign that says, \"please take one.\" Are you actually taking one? I know I wouldn't...and neither was this mischievous wizard! In fact, from the moment they tried on their costume that morning, they realized it came with magical powers. They knew exactly how they were going to use them. That Halloween night, they set off to begin their mischievous adventure. The plan was to use a summoning charm with their wand to summon all of the best candies into their bucket while trick or treating. It was all in good fun! and they totally got away with it.
