    "description": "I printed my first fake press pass in 2015 to detail the fine-line between American politics and American entertainment. \n\nBy the time the presidential campaign trail hit NYC, I’d become well versed in the art of massaging my way through media lines, maneuvering past security barricades and senior press corps without any credentials. \n\nThese 20 images are the result of a self-assigned initiative from 2015 - 2020 to explore the polarity of the United States and circumnavigate it's gatekeepers. \n\n\n“Sean Jackson’s series, “American Politics,” explores the haunting themes of disparity, anger and tribalism in this first-hand investigation of reportage as an outsider and underdog. His debut NFT collection – and only series of digital photographs – poetically depicts the expansive gap between citizens, political idols and a strange pageantry of electoral process pervading anger in the American streets.”\n\nEach is a unique 1/1. Owners can expect secondary bonus content on the 100th day.\n",
