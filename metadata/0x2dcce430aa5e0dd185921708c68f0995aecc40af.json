    "description": "Though the shape of the Adurald shard was determined by chance, the Tovaris tribe believe that it symbolises the swords at the heart of their militaristic society. For them, the greatest honour possible is to become a renowned swordsman who wins victories in the arena. The Adurald shard has for centuries been kept within the Great Hall of the Tovarin capital. Every man and woman is obliged to physically pay homage to the sacred shard at least once in their lifetime. It is said that only those who truly respect the Adurald will be blessed with supreme fighting ability.",
