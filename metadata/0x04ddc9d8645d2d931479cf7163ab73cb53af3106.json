    "description": "Sometimes in life there are periods of problems that hang over you and cover you with a dark veil from which it is very hard to get out. You don't want anything in life and you're angry at yourself. At such moments, life gives you little signs that you must not miss, and toward which you must move at least in small steps to heal yourself and be reborn.",
