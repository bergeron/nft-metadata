    "description": "Conservationist  was created with graphite and charcoal pencils on paper, it depicts a young African lady smiling, with her body  melting into  liquid (symbolic of the hydrosphere), and we see a flock of birds hovering around her afro hair as though they nest there. The piece also depicts two beautiful butterfly resting peacefully on both side of her shoulder.  This piece is symbolic of the earth's ecology and ecosystem, it shows how humans are connected, intertwined and dependent on the earths ecology, and by virtue of our superiority and intelligence as humans over every other life forms, we have been saddled with the responsibility to take care cultivate and nurture this ecology as this has a direct and indirect effect on our happiness and survival on earth.",
