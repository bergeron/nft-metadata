    "description": "Petare, Venezuela: the most violent slum in the world.\n\nLike many other favelas around the world, Petare consists of informal and precarious housing groups located on the outskirts of a metropolis (in this case Caracas, Venezuela's capital of 6 million people).\n\n Here, criminal gangs have taken over the political vacuum by operating illegally by taking over the local economy.\n\nThe city appears as a cluster of red-brick buildings, exposed or covered with colored plaster, and supported by concrete structures to compensate for the height difference caused by the slopes of the mountains surrounding the Venezuelan capital, where the slums are located. The tin roof and other temporary materials suggest a certain instability and poverty in the urban sector.",
