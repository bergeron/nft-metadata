    "description": "The unnamed robot girl was built in 1990 and has been working for a long time until she was recently broken. As a result, her memory has been damaged, and she is now trapped in her memories from the 1990s, unable to access more recent memories or connect to the present. She is lying down and does not know how long she has been stuck in this state.\n\nTeddy, the robot girl's best friend, has tried to help her by connecting to her chip and memory card to try to find a way to lead her out of this trapped state. After a long time, Teddy was able to locate the robot girl, but has been unable to reach her or find a way to help her escape her trapped state. It is unclear what has caused the robot girl's memory loss or what steps can be taken to help her regain access to her more recent memories.",
