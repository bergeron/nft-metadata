    "description": "Things arenâ€™t always as they seem. Some might look at this image and see a lady in red amongst a sea of ice. The beauty of salt lakes is that they take many forms and colours, allowing your imagination to run wild with what appears in front of you. \n\nRed is becoming a signature salt lake colour that I often find myself shooting. I asked myself instead of just shooting a red salt lake, how could I incorporate a colour I love so much and add a piece of myself into the image. Adding a contrast of fiery reds to the delicate blue landscape is what drew me to capture the final image.\n\nThe South Australian outback is notorious for being a hot and dry landscape, so finding a salt lake that felt so delicate and fragile was a rare occurrence that made me all the more excited to photograph its beauty.
