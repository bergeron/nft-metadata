    "description": "In my original vision, I was hoping to get the sun aligning with the pier. I’d gotten up at 5 AM every morning for ten straight days trying to get this shot but the clouds were always blocking the horizon. The end result was something I didn’t expect; I caught a beautiful sky with these gorgeous hues along the water. A reminder that we can’t control the elements and sometimes the unexpected is beautiful.\n\nThe image was photographed and curated by Gil Tamin, photographer based out of Toronto.\n\nEdition 1/1\n",
