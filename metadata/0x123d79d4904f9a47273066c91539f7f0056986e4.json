    "name": "TAMARIS",
    "description": "The Mediterranean coast is inconceivable without small and winding tamarisk trees, a caring plant\nof modest appearance is often called a sea broom. Tamaris, which we don't even notice until we need shade on the beach, stoically endures every whim of the Mediterranean. With these photographs I tried to portray the image of tamaris, as it is woven into me, on the edge of abstraction, in the melting of the horizon and the eternal dance of wind and waves.\n\nThe photo \"Tamaris\" is included in the Croatian national collection of the 28th Biennial of Color Photography 2019 in Spain.",
