    "description": "No matter how different moms are, they all have one fierce desire in common: to make us happy and save us from hardship.\n\nNo one has a completely smooth and serene relationship with their mother. Friction happens all the time, interspersed with periods of calm and short-term understanding. It is important to realize that their only goal was, is and will be our happiness. It is just their idea of how it should be, somewhat different from our own.",
