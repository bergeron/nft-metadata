    "description": "“Seed” is a hereditary curse transmitted from father to daughter. A disease? \n\nEvil is sneaky. It hides inside the roots of the sacred tree and is chasing your weakest moments to penetrate. Once the temptation is triggered the return isn’t easy.\n\n*Inspired by the Southern gothic novel of Ania Ahlborn focused on a modern demon possession story, published in 2020 by Suntup Editions.",
