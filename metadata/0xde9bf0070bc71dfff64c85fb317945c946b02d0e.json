    "description": "I made this image in the winter of 2018 during a backpacking trip at the Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado. The effect in this image was done in camera. It was not composited or manipulated in photoshop. (Explanation Below)\n\n\nAbout the collection: \"In Camera Abstractions\"\n\nThe images in this body of work are my best nature photographs over the last four years. All of the effects in these photographs were achieved in camera through various techniques that Iâ€™ve been experimenting with. None of these images were composited or manipulated in photoshop. \n\nBelow I will explain the technique that I used in this image.\n\nThe technique:\nHalfway through a 20-30 second long exposure, I cover the lens with the lens cap. While the lens cap is on, and the exposure is still ongoing, I quickly reposition the camera for the next composition, and remove the lens cap for the remainder of the exposure. This essentially creates a double exposure effect, but it is technically a single exposure.\n",
