    "description": "Iceland, a place of great physical beauty and power. The Arctic contains some of the greatest biodiversity on Earth.\n\n9:24 am, Sunrise in the winter in the Arctic. After just stepping off the plane to Reykjavik, I drove to the Reykjanes peninsula to the coastline to catch the sunrise. What a scene to be greeted with- harsh hurricane force winds with freezing snow drifts that seemed to dance over the roads.\n\nAs I stood on the Lava Tuff of Valahnúkur, I captured this moment in shock, the waves seemed so aggressive, hundreds of birds filled the coastline flying with a sense of mayhem, the scene just felt like a moment of madness that was softened by an elegant soft pink sunrise, accentuated by a nearby snowstorm in the distance. A moment in time I’ll remember forever.\n\nBidders edition; every bid placed on \"ELEGANT CHAOS\" received an edition of \"góðan daginn\".",
