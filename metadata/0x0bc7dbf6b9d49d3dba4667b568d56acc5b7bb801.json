    "description": "This artwork reflects my dream of achieving 32 ETH to become an Ethereum blockchain validator. \n\nNFTs have transformed my life as an artist, pulling me into a captivating rabbit hole. For over two years, this world has been my home, where I create, study, learn, and thrive. The complexity of the blockchain has captured my mind.\n\nBecoming a validator has become my burning obsession, but the path is challenging for those with limited resources.\n\nTo infuse meaning into the dream and romanticize it, I recall an infinity-shaped staircase symbolizing the elusive nature of the goal. \nPresent me stands on those steps, yearning for the future me. The future me gazes upon the present with kindness. \nThough today may seem dark, tomorrow shines brightly. \nThe goal will be achieved.\n\n\"The Infinite Journey\" was created with Midjourney, GPT4, the first Adobe Photoshop Beta integrating AI tools, and Adobe Lightroom.\n\nJune 1st, 2023\n\n14/32 ",
