    "description": "The House Bitcoins is the house built right on the line between reality and unreal.\nI have always been fascinated by this border which allows us to access dreams. We need to represent things abstract. Finally, the most abstract currency is the bitcoin whose design of the coin is the most symbolic and the best known. This house is nourished by that, and it is there because it will make the link between two worlds.\nSomething extraordinary will happen, and I want to be part of it.\nThis artwork is one part of this serie, The Living Room!",
