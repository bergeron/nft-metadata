    "description": "You’re excited by the potential of your IP. Maybe a character whose story you want to share – but what drives them, and where does their adventure lead? Or have you been captivated by an incredible environment that demands a history, a population? Let’s discuss the possibilities and agree on specific directions which will result in a one-page pitch document and a script of around ten pages that introduce the IP and its scope. Depending what medium interests you, that work could be written in the form of a comic story, a short film, or the opening of a movie or tv pilot.\n\n\nWhat you get?  \n- Up to 10 pages of script / story \n- General Hollywood rule is that 3 pages of story = 3 minutes of screen time  \nOrigin story vignette  \nDevelop your NFT character with Adrian in a personalized story\n\n\nTurn around time  \n- 30 days \n\n\nThings to keep in mind \n- After you win the auction we start to work on the vignette.  \n- Once the story is approved, no more big changes or big revisions.  \n- 2x minor revisions.",
