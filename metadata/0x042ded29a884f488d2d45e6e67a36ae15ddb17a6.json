    "description": "I first wrote \"Alexandrine\" while I was departing a long term relationship.  I linked up with one of my favorite producers /good friend Mark Evans to assist on instrumentation and production.  We released it fast and low key.  Not even a week after the release, our friend Grabbitz sent us this remix he titled \"Grabbitz 1994 Version\" -- which is a very sweet and subtle take on the original with added percussions and backing vocals.  Needless to say I was obsessed.  In fact, I was so excited that I forgot to release it.  But now feels like a good time.\n\nMark Evans and Grabbitz first ever NFT release btw :)",
