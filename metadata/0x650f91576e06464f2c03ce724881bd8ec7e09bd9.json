    "description": "3840 x 3840\n\n‘The Decision of the Flower’ (2022) is the first in the series of digital florals. Often portrayed as fragile and delicate, flowers also hold the power to sway emotions. They are used in times of happiness, sadness and uncertainty. Flowers are hypnotic, they captivate and allure. This Valentine’s Day release encapsulates the beauty and deception behind the bouquet. Its artificiality is emphasized and encouraged. An undying bouquet that does not wilt or fade. Forever in a loop. ",
