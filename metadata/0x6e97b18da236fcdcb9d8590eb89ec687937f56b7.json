    "description": "\"The line has to go from this to this,\" but why would you listen to them?\n\nYou may be lost if you don't follow what they say, but you will be lost if you don't follow your heart. \n\nEverything is unstable. Even the most straight ruler will break someday. Just do everything you want because you will die someday, people you love will die, and people who love you will also die. This statement might be a little harsh. But you must know.\n\nYou're not meant to live for someone else.\n\nLife is not stable",
