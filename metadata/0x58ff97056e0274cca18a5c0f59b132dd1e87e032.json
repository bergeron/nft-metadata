    "description": "This work is based on one of the hundreds of photos of flowers my mother took. She wanted to show us her garden, which I miss very much.\nThis work was an expression of my sadness for my parents and our traditional weekly gatherings, for the home I can't see because of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAnd it was this work that launched the collection I called “Mama`s garden”.\nIt's filled with many symbols and deep feelings.\n\nThis work is dedicated to all those who miss their parents, their home and can't see them.\n",
