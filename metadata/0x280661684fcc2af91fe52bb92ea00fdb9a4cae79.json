    "description": "Rather than taking an image of the fa√ßade of this art-deco styled bridge which spans the Sumida River, I used a perspective which reverses the architecture and doesn't allow one to automatically recognize the structure. Rather, the image invites the viewer to ask 'what is that?' and to take that curiosity into their own hands and see what they think the structure actually is.\n\nThe title 'Silent Support' reflects the idea of the structure being perceived as something that isn't noticed by most, but whose support is integral to the lifeblood set forth by the city and its citizens. There's something captivating about exploring these hidden details... the underbelly of the bridge holding a structure upon which we all depend upon every day.",
