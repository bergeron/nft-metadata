    "description": "how do you define good? how do you notice good? intuition? conscience? categorizing? where does it come from? when is cruelty accepted? when is cruelty not judged? what does this art convey? the questioning of the religious definition of good and evil? the exchange of weaponry? the true identity of who people are? what message is it passing across? \nthose questions are left for you the viewer to answer. \n\nArtist: David Nushé",
