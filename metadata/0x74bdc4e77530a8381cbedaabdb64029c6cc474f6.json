    "description": "This photo was taken during Hanami Sakura, or the Japanese Cherry Blossom Bloom on April 25th, 2022 at the Japanese Garden in Jackson Park, Chicago, Illinois. This small bird perched upon the branches for a small moment, then it flew away. I happened to get two shots of this bird, and at first I felt they weren't perfect. Then I realized that moments of beauty aren't meant to be perfect, but are meant to be experienced.",
