    "description": "[Tell me you love me]\nThis work was born from a single painting.\n \nIntroduction\nep1\n\nIn the year 2122, mankind still survived on the earth.\n\nThe climate on the earth has changed completely, and the oceans have frozen over in what used to be described as subtropical regions.\n\nThe wealth gap has widened and the wealthy control the world.\n\nPeople were becoming transhumanists and shedding their body parts. People enjoyed fashion in a way that took hold of their identities in trendy styles.\n\nOne of the most notable molds was a model developed by KDC. It was a female humanoid created for advertising purposes, with silver hair, blue lips, yellow eyes, and a very beautiful face.\n\nKDC's model had become the center of fashion, and many companies were now featuring this model.\n\nEverything was artificial, her movements and voice were controlled by Ai, and her actions and emotions were determined by a high-speed blockchain technology that transmitted them through her artificial nerves.",
