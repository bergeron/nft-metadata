    "description": "*Abduction* is the first ‘Yeah The Girls’ glow up to drop in the NFT market, using an OG hand drawn girl, it morphs through an animated scene of strange behaviour to reveal the final full colour girl. \n\n'Yeah The Girls' begun as original, hand drawn sketches before being morphed into a growing collection of 1/1 animated GLOW UPS ✨\n\nWith a whimsy flurry of Pantone© colour, splashes of vibrance, loads of pattern, IRL collage, photography, utter chaos, hints of nostalgia, layers upon layers & INCOMING SOON: IRL prints/skate decks & AR dabbles that pairs your IRL things to your NFT.\n\n'Yeah The Girls' is a total happy place & a massive high-five to anyone spreading the love in this Web3 world. ❤️",
