    "description": "Adam's Cube is a work of art designed as a symbol of humanity's desire for intelligence and apples. The work is full of surreal geometric forms and surfaces. The cube is depicted as a symbol of intelligence, while the bronze spiral details represent the desire within man. The artist has taken Adam's Cube as a commentary on human nature and aims to reflect the coexistence of intelligence and desire. The work aims to reveal the dualities and contrasts in the inner world of human beings while questioning their existence in a complex world.",
