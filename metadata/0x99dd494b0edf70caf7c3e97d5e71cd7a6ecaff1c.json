    "description": "Our custom coded NFT contract will allow ANY TOKEN to interact with it, that’s right ANY TOKEN. As a NFT holder we will take ALL of the 5/5 tax that’s generated from the RUNESTONE token and use it to reinvest in other tokens that will help give our investors a larger chance at achieving their financial goals. These decisions will be made from THE CLAN, listening in on Twitter Space AMAs with these communities and their Devs, Those communities raiding the RUNESTONE main Twitter and potentially having Youtube AMAs as well with Ryan. Once our community has chosen the route in which we go, we will invest that money that has been accumulated from the tax, and invest in the winning token. You will then be able to connect your wallet that holds your NFT to the Dapp and claim your tokens OR you may keep them in your NFT and Build your NFTs worth, hence RUNE BAG. (This generates a higher floor price for your NFT, in perpetuity). What we will do then, as Vikings did when conquering new territories, is join our now fellow comrades from the winning token and hold VCs with them, shill/ raid with them… allowing THE CLAN to show their strength. We will build allies along the way, new CLAN members, and all the while we are building for that great day when the bull returns.",
