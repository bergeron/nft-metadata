    "name": "Behind the Mask",
    "description": "This is the first of a series of works that sees NoCap as the protagonist and in particular this work sees the birth of the character.\n\nThe work aims to deal with the theme of masks, increasingly widespread in today's society. Masks in this case are interpreted by the “NoCaps”. Our character chooses to wear the mask that most of all\nmakes him feel free to express himself and his creativity. Only through creativity we can free ourselves from an increasingly standardized world.\n\nArtist: Simon Dee\nSize: 1080 × 1920\nSound Designer: Matteo Ancarani",
