    "description": "Neverglitch: Generative Materiality\n\nA glitched raven's skull forms the canvas on which a bespoke constellation of material properties coalesce to form a series of 240 one of a kind mints.\n\nUndulating attributes such as specular tint, hue, and sheen are modified algorithmically. The few skulls that get generated during dramatic property shifts are particularly remarkable.\n\nThis is the first of the series to be released and is my personal favorite.",
    "Longing": "Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.",
