    "description": "A reflection of what I have felt during the pandemic. Thoughts consuming and contaminating my mind. A very introspective time for me as the build-up from the past years started taking its toll on me, while trying to numb myself and feel everything at the same time. Trying to find back my essence. \n\nThis is one of my personal best works. Grateful for never having stopped creating.\n\nBerlin, 2020. \nShot on medium format film, Ilford HP5. \n\nTalent: Suhyun & Minh",
