    "description": "Starting in 2017, yellow faces / ornaments / blots, or as I call them sprouts, began to appear on the streets of cities. In street culture, there is such a thing as a Tag, a quick note on the surface, from the fact that “I was here.” \n\n The walls never attracted me, the asphalt is a clean and untouched surface that does not hurt the eyes and does not spoil the overall look of the city. Sprouts grow from cracks, water canals, sewers or any flat ground surface. They don’t have a gender or any meaning beside being on the street under your foot.  \n\nYou can see the creation process at the link:  https://youtu.be/tWqm32kxe28  \n\nThis series presents the three most common icons of Sprouts.",
