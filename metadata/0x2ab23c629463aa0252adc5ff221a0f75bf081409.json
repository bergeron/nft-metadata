    "description": "For my first Sound drop I spoke about often second guessing ideas and sacrificing consistency for comfort, which often resulted in a lot of the music I create never reaching the ears of listeners. After seeing the amazing response to my Genesis release and once again looking at all of the unreleased music in my catalog I landed on this record “So Many Ways.”\n\n“So Many Ways” is a record that Da-P and I worked on in the Summer of 2022 while he stayed with me in LA as we finished our EP “It’s Not That Deep.” I thought no better way to kick off 2023 and my first Web3 release of the year than with this record that I think builds on this theme from my Genesis release and is a sort of reminder to myself to not overlook all of the work put in along the way and to sometimes just “let it fly” when it comes to the music my friends and I work so hard at creating.\n\nI hope you enjoy “So Many Ways” and that this record can be a public reminder to myself about remaining consistent, inspired and out of my own way in 2023 and beyond. Thank you for coming along on this journey with me. I’ll be back soon!\n",
