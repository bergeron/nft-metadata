    "description": "The little Lost in Wonderland has been part of our childhood for much more than being a story for children, behind it there are many stories and many secrets that make it something enigmatic to the present\n\nThis is life, sometimes it seems that we are in a wonderful world externally, with smiles, friends and success, but inside there is an earthquake of emotions and situations that alter our entire being, this painting is a reflection of those days, of those moments that actually change us and make us see what the real world is like\n\n Originally painted in oil and acrylic on traditional canvas ",
