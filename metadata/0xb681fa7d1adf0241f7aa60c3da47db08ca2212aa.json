    "description": "The mind of a child.... When all things are quiet and the world still scares us. Our only cares are the dirt beneath our feet and the cottonwood floating through the air. So we dance to show we are thankful to be alive. We dance for the hidden worlds we discover and for the adventures we find ourselves on. This piece embodies the spirt of our childlike minds.. forever preserving it in time. \n\nI hope this image reminds you of the beauty in the world all around us... as it does for me.\n\n4240 X 2832",
