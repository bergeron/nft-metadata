Awelewa is a beauty god who was not just beautiful but serves as a warrior protecting her people. Her popularity extended through the neighbouring town. Her fighting prowess was unmatched during days of war.\nShe's bald, her baldness was an intentional act, this enables her fight skilfully during war. She won so many battles during her lifetime.\nHer beauty was envied by all. She was never married neither did she give birth until time of death.",
