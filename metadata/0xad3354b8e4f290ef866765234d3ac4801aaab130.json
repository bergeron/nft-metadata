    "description": "Self-Reflection, Oska, 2023\n\nWhat do you see looking back at you, when you start to look deep within your soul? Subconsciousness, imagination, dreams but also fears, doubts, anxieties. Things we all share but are all unique to every one of us. If thoughts are a direct proof of our existence, then a reflection of who you are is what you would see. \n\nThis piece is inspired by those thoughts. Who are we really? Who am i? Questions that will never truly be answered, but are at the very core of our reality nonetheless.\n\nThe eye represents the soul, our perception of the world. The kid is us, children of the Universe. Binding to reality we seek, but all we ever know is ourselves. Travelers without a map, faced by our own conscious experiences.\n\nIf you look close enough, you might just find yourself.",
