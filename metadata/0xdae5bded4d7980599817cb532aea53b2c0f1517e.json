    "description": "The Rug Shop started in our mom's basement. We spent years taking smack from animals, until one day we decided we had enough! We started our own rug shop in our basement. Next thing you know, we moved our shop to the corner of West Street. Now we're making rugs for others, building our Gang of Rugsters.",
