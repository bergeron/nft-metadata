    "description": "Mia Van Rooy photographed by Wim Van Cappellen\n\nThe lady with the laptop is my mom. At 88, she’s still going strong. Mia Van Rooy has lived the life. She has been a teacher, a journalist, a record store owner and a gallery owner. She’s a mother of two and grandmother of six. Thanks to her grandson Alexander, she's interested in crypto and through me she got to know NFT's. Thanks to the Who We Are project, I could immortalize her on the blockchain. Every morning, she visits her neighbour in the remote village of Kieldrecht, Belgium. They talk about the weather, snooker and since recently, NFT’s. \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/WimVanCappellen)",
