    "description": "Altamura Island is located in the Mar the Cortez, near the State of Sinaloa, Mexico. \n\nThe boat couldn't reach shore; I had to walk with water reaching above my knees for about 2.5 miles carrying a 30kg bag worth of equipment and life support stuff behind my back.\n\nAbout me:\nI am Alfredo Juárez, an Astrophotographer from Sinaloa, Mexico. I picked my first camera (a Konica Minolta) in high school. I felt in love with Astrophotography when I traveled 600+ miles to chase the Neowise comet back in 2020. Being there, in the middle of nowhere is a healing process for me, and I plan to continue doing it for as long as I can.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, and display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
