    "description": "The remaining Carrie Blast Furnaces tower almost 100 feet over the Monongahela River, providing exceptionally rare, real-life examples of pre-World War II iron-making technology and a glimpse into the industrial past of Pittsburgh, now virtually invisible elsewhere in the revitalized city.\n\nHaving grown up in Pittsburgh during the final years of the steel industry's collapse there, I find myself drawn to visit the blast furnaces when I return, in search of the way the light can blaze in through gaps in the deteriorating buildings and illuminate something of the city's heyday, the last dregs of which fascinated me as a child.",
