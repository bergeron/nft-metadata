    "description": "Chasing Paradise is the first single off of my EP Glass House.\r\n\r\nThis song came together in Malibu when me and a few friends went to the beach after a long day of music. Slenderbodies brought a guitar and started noodling and before we knew it we had created a mini band on the beach by gathering a bunch of random objects along the shoreline and finessing them intro makeshift instruments. We threw some chords together and what started as a fun joke became a race against time to get back to the Airbnb and throw it down in Ableton. If you listen closely to the beginning of the song, the OG voice memo is still in there!\r\n\r\nWinner of the NFT will receive:\r\n\r\nThe original voice memo of the song\r\n2 (Two) VIP Tickets to any Daniel Allan headline show\r\nUnreleased Daniel Allan merch item",
