    "description": "\"In the dissolution of the image, a new body is birthed over and over. Once that is as real as us. One that is flat, one that provokes, promotes, entices, and enriches. One of controversy, of truth, and its absence. A body that is time, simultaneously more and less. It survives and eradicates.\" Eyes of the Beholder is a continuation of Hirad Sab’s work in their thesis, fascinated by the abundance of generative avatars in the contemporary virtual landscape, made possible by computational advances of leaps and bounds. An army of Silver Surfer-like ‘persons’ stretches to the horizon. Sab is compelled by the ubiquity of virtual selves, how it changes our attitudes and our perception of others. They offer an evolving mask, suggesting ever- new types of objectivity and impartiality, behind an endless set of personalities, characters, demeanors pulling us in and repulsing us at once. ",
