    "description": "Although the passage of time affects all organic and non-organic forms, humans are the only species aware of it and have created many pieces of art to praise or condemn it.We tried to slow down the passage of time and how it consum our bodies or even speed it up in some cases to fit in our lifestylies. The relationship between humans and time is unique and fascinating.We turned time into a cultural and religious element. In my work, I consider human as the main character, as a traveler in time. Iâ€™m inspired by the Renaissance elements and integrated them into the futuristic style. We are time travelers. We inherit the past, live in the present and shape the future.  \n*this work made for jetlagweekly contest. \"TIME TRAVEL\" as a theme.",
