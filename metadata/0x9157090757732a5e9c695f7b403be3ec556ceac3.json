    "description": "This is a piece that was created for the Killer GF derivative contest, so I have to give credit to Zeronis, Kiwi, and the team for the design. I have a lot of love for the community and if I ever am able to I'd like to get my KGF out of the vault for the long haul.\n\nIt didn't place, so it kind of has no real value in particular, but I wanted to list it anyways for closure. Giving invites to others who didn't place in hopes they can do the same.\n\nI set my other piece a bit too high but after a bit more experience trading I came to find no one (including myself) likes paying .1 or more for new mints, so I'll be setting a price of .0723 for this in case anyone ever wants it. \n\nI'm grateful to anyone who appreciates my art whether they buy it or not, so thanks to everyone who showed love to my piece. Special thanks as always to Kyle, Moyashi, miozn, etc. for their support, and to the doomers in the floor chat (I don't want to forget any names from there and am running out of characters.)\n",
