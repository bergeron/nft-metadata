    "description": "I wore board shorts and a t-shirt to swim up until I was a young adult for no other reason than simply being afraid of judgement. Pale, skinny, covered in moles. The few moments where I was able to escape to my little lichen patch in the woods and shed my clothes in solitude were some of the highlights of my adolescence. Feeling the sun and the air on my skin was a magical experience and there was no one to judge me except myself. It was here that I slowly learned to be kinder to myself and get comfortable enough in my own skin to bear a little more in public. \n\nYour purchase of this NFT helps me create similar experiences for others while simultaneously protecting natural habitats from future destruction. You will receive an art print (size/material to be discussed) with each purchase and will be commemorated on a plaque located at whichever conservation area you helped me create by being an early supporter. Buy my nudes = save the world!",
