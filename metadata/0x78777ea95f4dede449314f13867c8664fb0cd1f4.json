    "description": "King of The Jungle\n\nThis majestic creature, also known as 'King of The Jungle', once controlled and protected the nature with their ferocious bite, powerful muscles and fearsome claws.\nThey also play a big part in the ecosystem, being a predator and controlling wildlife populations since ancient times.\n\nSadly, as humans rises; the nature falls.\n\nOver the past decades, the Bengal tiger are listed as 'Endangered species'. Their habitats are being invaded by humans, they are being illegally hunted and killed for sport. The once-proud 'King of The Jungle' are now under threats.\n\nItâ€™s a tragedy that even in 2022 some people are still unaware of this crisis, and the government are not taking the issue seriously. So, I start this project\nas a reminder of the problem. Tigers need your attention more than ever. Therefore, with this project, I will donate 30% of my profit to the SeubNakhasathien Foundation\nto support their works and helps create awareness.",
