    "description": "嫉妬　しっと　Envy\n\nOne of seven pieces from【Sins With Friends】collection, inspired by the seven deadly sins.  \nEach piece is a representation of the mysterious feeling that comes from doing something sinful in the company of a friend. A feeling that is somewhat bad, yet good at the same time.\n\nEarlier in his career, Gengoya was known for creating illustrations to introduce Japanese vocabulary. This has become his signature approach, with each artwork attempting to introduce one Japanese word to the audience. The【Sins With Friends】collection is no different; a Japanese word for each sin is subtly integrated into the artwork with light shading.",
