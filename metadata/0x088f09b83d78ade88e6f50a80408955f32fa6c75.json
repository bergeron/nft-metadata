    "description": "\"Amongst Us\" is a thought-provoking digital artwork that explores the delicate balance between our aspirations and the limitations of our daily lives. The artwork juxtaposes tangible objects from our everyday lives, symbolized by a lemon or lime, with intangible and seemingly unattainable dreams, represented by the distant concept of the moon.\nThe artwork encourages us to strive towards our dreams with hard work and dedication, but reminds us that achieving a balance between our aspirations and the limitations of our daily lives may be a constantly shifting target. Even when our dreams seem within our grasp, they may still require ongoing effort and adaptation to achieve.\nThrough the surrealistic landscape, \"Amongst Us\" prompts reflection on the pursuit of our dreams and the ever-changing process of finding equilibrium between our aspirations and reality. In essence: work hard, but don't be too hard on yourself.",
