    "description": "Mind healer - she has echoes of Buddhism in her incarnation. Like medicine buddha, she heals my soul in this difficult and dark time. There is also a share of crypto-gothic in this work. The inscriptions on top of the canvas symbolize my dislike and the blurring of my vision of the world. And dirt and interference, the transience of time. No matter how much dirt there is on top, time is still cyclical and everything will come full circle and heal the world and your souls.",
