    "description": "The Packard Automotive Plant in Detroit, MI USA opened in the early 1900s and was a premier facility for manufacturing luxury cars. Creating jobs for thousands of workers, the factory provided for numerous families until its closure in the late 1950s. The skeletons of the factory stand as a reminder of what once was, but the people whose livelihood depended on the industry are all but a memory. \n\nThis collaborative artwork was created from an original photo by TRENT NORTH and digital painting/animation by GASSAN AQEL. \n\nMusic by SHAVGASS used by permission.\nSHAVGASS is a duo that consists of SHAVKAT AV & GASSAN AQEL.\n\nNo AI was utilized in the creation of this work.\n\nLicense: The NFT owner has unlimited right to personal use, public display and publication with credit to the creators.
