    "description": "Slicky was captured in Laguna Beach on September 25th 2017. This sunrise was particularly special because the wildfires in Riverside still hadn't been contained and the smoke created vibrant long lasting colors during sunrise. There wasn't much swell at that time, but I was dead set on trying to find waves that morning even if they were barely 1ft tall.  \n\nI stumbled across this location while driving up and down the PCH with the thought process of \"well if I still can't find any waves, at least this is a pretty location to photograph the sunrise from land\".\n\nWhile checking this spot I noticed some very small, but insanely glassy waves breaking close to shore. I decided to suit up as fast as possible and get in the water. I never would have thought I'd capture anything nearly as special as \"Slicky\". It was definitely a one in a million opportunity.\n\nCamera Gear:\nCanon 1DX2\nCanon 85mm 1.2Lii\nSPL Waterhousing\n\nCamera Settings:\nShutter 1/1000\nAperture F4\nISO 200\nFocal Length 85mm",
