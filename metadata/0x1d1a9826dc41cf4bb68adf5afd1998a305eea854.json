    "description": "After the collapse of the USSR, my country (Georgia) finally was independent again. My children were the first generation in my family who were born after the USSR and had not experienced the abnormalities of the system. From 2009 to 2015 I was photographing my kids, as a symbol of a new generation, a new way of thinking, and hope of Independent Georgia. I was always fascinated with family albums. Because even during wars and extreme situations the first object that people took with them from their houses, were family photo albums as a symbol of memories and pieces of the past. Shooting mostly documentary work as a woman photographer and at the same time watching my kids grow into amazing individuals, I decided to do a different kind of work and dedicated my first photo book “Endless Questions” to them, which was published in 2016 by Italian publisher “Damiani”.
