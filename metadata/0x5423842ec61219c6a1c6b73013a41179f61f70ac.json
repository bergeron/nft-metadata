    "name": "Frozen Eclipse",
    "description": "July 27, 2018.\nFar off the coast of western Greenland.\n\nResidual magenta hues from the evening’s spectacular sunset still haunt the frigid sky above.  A glowing blood red moon of this century’s longest total lunar eclipse slowly rises above the rounded snowy peaks of an enormous solitary iceberg.  This icy anomaly, carved and shaped by relentless winds and waves, stands as a compelling testament to the power of nature.  Out in these deep Atlantic waters, it seems to be the only witness to this rare, celestial event;  A silent observer of the moon’s dance within the midst of the earth’s shadow in a breathtaking display of natural wonder.",
