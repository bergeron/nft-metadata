    "description": "The story of these NFTs is a little sad, since the story itself is about a boy who turned 15 this summer, he does not have a disability yet \nbut he will get it, and most likely he will get the 2nd group. He doesn't think clearly, and is very far behind in development, studies separately from full-fledged children with the same as himself, his name is Vova, and this is my brother! I just need help buying gifts for my brother, I'm not rich, and I can't afford such gifts, but I love him very much, and I want to help in life, so I ask for help from good-natured people who will not pass by, but will help people like my brother. Volodya asks me for a phone, a computer, and a big TV like friends, I can't refuse him, so I try to buy at least something of what he wants for Christmas!",
