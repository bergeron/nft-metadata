    "description": "As a Prequel to Chasing The Dragon being released, I'm making 10 editions of this piece, one of my favorite shots.  \n\nCollectors of these editions will be considered Original Collectors and gifted future airdrops of exclusive pieces from future collections/ editions.\n\n\"Chasing the Dragon\" refers to the elusive pursuit of a high equal to the userâ€™s first use of a drug, which after acclimation is no longer achievable. This series explores art as a form of intoxication through film, symbolism, color, light & surrealism. It aims to seduce the viewer, and promise them things they might never grasp again. \n\nAs a survivor of opiate addiction, this series has deep roots in its meaning and symbolisms for me. \n\nShot with Ricoh XR-P on 35mm Kodak Portra 800 \n\nMODEL: AMELIA HAMMER HARRIS",
