    "description": "This installation \"transforms the scenery of famous landmarks in Osaka by arranging a large number of familiar red road cones. The installation was carried out in 2012 as an extension of the \"cone and the city\" fieldwork. The work was subsidized by the Osaka Prefectural Government's \"Osaka Canvas\" cultural program, and was shown to the public at several public and commercial facilities, including the Osaka Prefectural Office, Utsubo Tennis Center, and JR Osaka Mitsukoshi Isetan. The red landscapes, which had a powerful impact on viewers in an instant and required no unnecessary explanation or translation, could be interpreted in various ways by each viewer, and each venue became a photo spot for visitors. This is a view of the installation at the Utsubo Tennis Center. ",
