    "description": "Unique photo 1/1 signed by the artist photographer and psychologist Stefano Favaretto of the beautiful landscape of Tuscany in Italy. The photo taken during a thunderstorm shows a ray of sunshine appearing behind the raindrops. In life even when we find ourselves in a situation where everything seems very difficult we must be able to see that ray of sunshine. There is always hope even in difficult times and we must not stop believing in it.",
