    "description": "Hello!  \nThis is my last artwork made in 2022. All objects depicted here is represent what i’ve been through in 2022, metaphorically and literally. I am sure for each of you, the objects and their arrangements might have a different meaning and feeling than I am. And I think the multi-interpretative way of viewing the same things is really interesting.  Sometimes, it’s inspiring for me to see things from different view on a different mental landscape. This has drive me to see more depth into my inner situation; start sowing and well maintain it to attain the fairness of the harvest.\n\nI wish you all a very healthy, happy and prosperous new year!\n\nTegalalang, December 31, 2022\n\n\nAGUGN  \n",
