    "description": "As a photographer we always have moments with a lack of creativity, which leads me to experiment and create new challenges, starting with these photos I took in Valladolid, Yucat√°n.\n\nThis 1/1 piece comes with a full size print signed by me shipped anywhere in the world.\n\nI'm very grateful for the support of my work. That is what keeps me motivated to create more art for all of you.",
