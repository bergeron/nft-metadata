    "description": "As a Middle Eastern woman who was born at the wartime, and currently lives in another protest for her fundamental basic rights, she could never get rid of the feeling of fear, insecurity and suspension.\nThe scenes of blood, bludgeon, slaughters and tortures, the sound of shooting and annoying noises are always turning in her head.\nShe prays, she fights, she dances, and still tries hard to tear up the boundaries.",
