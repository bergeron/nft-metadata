    "description": "LNRZ ON SOUND WK 3\n\nIn a remote effort this song originated from Lyrah, was blessed by bloody white, and finalized by Clear eyes. Lyrah & bloody white are two artists who we've grown to love and admire. To hear them on a song together was a dream come true. \n\nA note from the artists:\n\nLyrah - This song feels like overwhelm + optimism. I wrote it at my piano on a rainy LA day. I remember feeling buried by my to do list, like I was just keeping my head above water. And itâ€™s amazing to obsess over the things you make, but sometimes you lose yourself in it.\n\nbloody - Do dogs actually go to heaven? If so, can they talk once they arrive? Something to think about.\n\nJeremy - I loved this tune the moment I heard it - I'm so grateful to Lyrah and bloody for trusting me to take it across the finish line! Perhaps my favorite part of the creative process.",
