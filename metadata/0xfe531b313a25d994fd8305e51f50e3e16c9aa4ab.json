    "name": "Leisure Suit Larry: Love For Sail",
    "description": "Airbrush painting circa 1990 for game publisher Sierra Entertainment as part of the Leisure Suit Larry series. In fact, this was the final installment in the series and considered one of the racier versions. Always fun yet challenging to paint Larry and keep the character consistent.",
