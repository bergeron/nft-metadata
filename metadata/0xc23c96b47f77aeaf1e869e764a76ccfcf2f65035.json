    "description": "       I began this project, “Mother” because I was always fascinated and inspired by my mother,\nIsobel. These photos are a direct reflection of our bond and what she means to me. She is\nthe loving and caring parent, that she never had, to my siblings and I.  I aim to capture the essence of my mother in an unedited and nuanced way. This collection of photos attaches the memories that I have shared with my mom while also depicting the life and history she lived before me. This series serves as a double portrait as for I am\na reflection of my mother.  ",
