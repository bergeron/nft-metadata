    "description": "Series Name: Uncanny Pixel Size: 4160 × 6240 (Ongoing project)\n\nA ritual begins, The shutter clicks, From beyond A ghostly vision.\n\nFor me photographing is alienating myself, only then I can work, by not actively participating but by being an active observer. And as an alien, I bring back pieces of an uncanny world, doors to outer possibilities. Transcending ordinary thought I portray my daily life as eerily mysterious.\n\nUncanny is an ongoing personal creative project since 2013. The majority of the pieces in this collection are experiments within night photography techniques, long exposures, and/or open flash.\n\nhttps://danielsul.com/uncanny",
