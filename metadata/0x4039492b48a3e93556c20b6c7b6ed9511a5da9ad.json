    "description": "Upon entering the Museum of the Impossible, you may get an odd sense of both moving in all directions at once and standing still. You begin to notice that all of your senses are heightened as the electrifying smell of vibrant purples begin to emit from the paintings, the confusing taste of durian as you brush by a statue.\n\nEnjoy your visit to the museum as you may leave with the overwhelming, emotional sense of having learned the entirety of existence without being able to describe a single thing.  \n______  \n______\n\nAI generated using OpenAI neural networks running VQGAN+CLIP models inspired solely by the text prompt: Walk through the Museum of the Impossible by Vincent Di Fate",
