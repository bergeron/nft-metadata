    "description": "This piece evokes the memories of my weekly hair routine at the hair dresser shop as as child.  \nThe pain that comes with every comb of my 4c hair , the smell of the sulphur and menthol filled hair cream as she applied it on my scalp. My back aching from sitting on the old stove now converted into a stool.  \nThe happiness that comes after my hair has been made and I feel brand new.  \nThose memories will always remain special and Iâ€™ll always cling to them.",
