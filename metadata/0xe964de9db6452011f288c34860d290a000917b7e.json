    "description": "Crown Juuls delves into the complex and intimate relationship between individuals and digital technology. In three captivating animations, a peculiar robotic figure exercises aboard floating vessels resembling regal crowns. Upon closer examination, these crowns are revealed to be composed of everyday consumer electronics such as fitness trackers and exercise equipment, connected devices that track our physical health.\n\nThrough this interplay of symbols, artist Jonathan Monaghan critiques the growing influence of technology and the state in monitoring and controlling our lives, exploring the impact on privacy and individual autonomy. The artist sheds light on the commodification of health, and how technology has perpetuated a culture of self-optimization. With its thought-provoking commentary, Crown Juuls offers a nuanced perspective on the delicate balance between technology, power, privacy, and the self in the era of the surveillance state.",
