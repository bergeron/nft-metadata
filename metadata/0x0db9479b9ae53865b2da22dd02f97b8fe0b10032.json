    "description": "This is a song for all of my grinders + hustlers working to prove themselves & serves a reminder that there is nobody like them. This one-of-a-kind music NFT is not just a piece of art, but a symbol of individuality and inspiration.\n\nMy music is all about uplifting spirits, and this embodies that same message. I created \"1:1\" to motivate and remind everyone that they are special and unique in their own way. Each one of us has something valuable to offer the world, and this music NFT is a celebration of just that!\n\nAs you immerse yourself in my music, let it serve as a constant reminder of your own greatness. This NFT is not just an investment in art, but an investment in yourself. Let it motivate you to pursue your dreams and be your best self.\n\nWritten, Performed, Recorded and Mixed by Nessy the Rilla\nProduced by Majestic\nRecorded at The Pharmacy Studios - Houston, TX",
