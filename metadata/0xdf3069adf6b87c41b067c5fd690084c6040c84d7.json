    "description": "Bauhaus' Puzzle—Act 1 was made for the gallery opening of Mono, a micro-gallery located in Tunis specializing in digital art. The piece is a reflection on the artist's formative years as a graphic designer. She layers AI-generated acrylic paint footage with vector-designed Bauhaus-inspired grids, as an attempt to question the grid system as a foundational image-making instrument.",
