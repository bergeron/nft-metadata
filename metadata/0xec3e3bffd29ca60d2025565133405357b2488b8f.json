    "description": "I saw you from across the way, lost deep inside of yourself as the night held us closeâ€”the rain dancing on our skin, each drop creating a mirror of a strange world deep within.\n\nWe were so much younger then, caught up in our pursuit of wishful dreams. Time distorts even the most powerful memories and leaves us longing for pieces of the past that hover on the edge of recollection, a flicker of a flame trying to weather the storm.",
