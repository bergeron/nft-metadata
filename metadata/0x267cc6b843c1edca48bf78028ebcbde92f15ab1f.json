    "description": "A great war is about to begin.\n\nFor a long time, the \"Land of White\" and the \"Land of Red\" have been in a state of cold war. This false peace is about to end.\n\nHa-Death, king of the Land of Black, is plotting to bring about this war and lead the world into chaos.\n\nHe has told the \"Land of Red\" that the \"Black Xanadu,\" a sacred weapon said to be able to rule the world, is hidden in the \"Land of White.\n\nOne man was trying to stop this war.\n\nThe mountains of A Pulus.\nA mountain range where many monsters nestle, and no normal human can enter and return home alive.\n\nA man was running through these mountains with a leaping ability and speed far beyond that of humans.\nHe is a muscular warrior with a lion's head and an injured right eye.\n\n\"The One-Eyed Lion King.\n\nThat is what he was called.\nBecause of his eerie appearance and his overwhelming swordsmanship and magic, no one made him an enemy.\nHis actions and true nature were a mystery, and he did not belong to any nation.
