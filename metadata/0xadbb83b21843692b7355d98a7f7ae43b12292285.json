    "description": "In the arms of women and conversations. Flowing endlessly through golden fields. We hold hands with tears of happiness in our little world. I wonder where you are now.\n\nThis artwork is a metaphorical memory of my first friend I made in school. Both our families were immigrants in America, but I always cherished that we embraced each others differences.",
