Salisby Dalisby abandons his beautiful lighted plate home and takes his family to the new much larger custom home.  Salisby follows his sons, his dear wife holding their new born daughter into the entrance of the metaverse home. The dark lords have a very unpleasant surprise as the family moves deeper into the home entrance.",
