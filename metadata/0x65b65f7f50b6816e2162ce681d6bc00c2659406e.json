    "description": "The Poster Image for the film A Wonderful Way with Dragons was shot by world-renowned photographer Henri Prestes. \n\nPrestes, a friend of the film’s producers, read the script and offered to lend his unique vision to the project by seeking out the majestic mare mentioned in the story. He searched small villages throughout his home country of Portugal, and finally came upon a mare in the wild.   \n\nKnown for his melancholic, dream-like images, Prestes perfectly captured the tone of the film’s drama and offered the image to the producers, endorsing their endeavor to raise money for the film with 50% of the proceeds from the sale of this Digital Collectible going to the charity, New York Cares, to support \"Stand With Students\" - the city's largest initiative to assist the Students and Teachers of Title I NYC Public Schools.
