    "description": "When I was 5 years old, my parents bought my siblings and I our first ever video game console for Christmas. I remember having my mind completely blown as my cousins had a Nintendo 64 and ever since I first saw it, I wanted one.\n\n So here we are on Christmas morning of 1997, unwrapping this shiny new original playstation and I couldn’t be more ecstatic. My brother was so young at the time that he wasn’t really able to play, but one of his favourite things to do was grab a controller and pretend he was playing along while I was doing all the work. \n\nAs we grew up, video games became a huge part of our life and how we bonded with each other, we would talk about anything and everything in the world, we would play late into the night when it was really 10pm and that felt like we were staying up all night. It was us against the world, forever. \n\nThis piece is an ode to my brother and those moments we shared together in our early childhood. \n",
