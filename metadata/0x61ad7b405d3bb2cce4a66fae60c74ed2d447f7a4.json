    "description": "This is a derivative work of Luv-san's work entitled \"Luv Luna LOVE!!!\" It features the beloved Luv-chan and Sakura-san's Luna-chan, original characters. It was created amid the much anticipated ETH fork and minted shortly after. Together Luv-chan and Luna-chan share a strong relationship and are the best of friends. Spending time with one another merges their interests as they get to know one another.\n\nPerusing Twitter among the best Japanese NFT artists helps me grow as a person, collector, and artist. I am thankful to what they have to offer as a community, and I thank Luv-san and Sakura-san for allowing a humble person as myself to recreate their original characters in this work. („ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åüüôá.) I like to think of this project as a study that grew the artist in me. As a signature of the wan style, the panting breath had to be included. Sorry Sakura-san! \n\n\n\nLuv:\nTwitter @luvluv_eth\nFoundation @luvluvvox\n\nSakura:\nTwitter @NFT0226\nFoundation @arinosakura\n\n5626x7501\n360 ppi",
