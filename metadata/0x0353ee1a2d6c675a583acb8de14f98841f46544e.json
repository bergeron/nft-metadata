    "description": "Columns, bars, concrete, steel all appear hard, but to me are a meal. There is vastness, there is space, there is me, a flick of a finger and there are more than enough fishes to fill the sea. Here, i am the herald, a mad man, and these are creations of my own making, so beautiful, so bright. One would wish they were for the taking. In darkness, and in light, my creations illuminate, some call it sorcery, but you can say it's all in the hands of fate.",
