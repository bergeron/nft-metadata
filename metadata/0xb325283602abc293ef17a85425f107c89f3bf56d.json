    "description": "«He wanted to watch the sky, but the light never went out. Tired of waiting, he went back to his tent and forgot his telescope in the spring rain.»\n\nThis artwork denounces the growing problem of light pollution, strongly reducing the quality of astronomical observations, or preventing them altogether. Amateurs and professionals are concerned. What if, for just one night a year, we turn off all the lights? How magically rich would the sky look?\n\nThe staged vintage telescope represents a time when light pollution did not yet prevent observations from a garden.\n \n\n____\nFile details: 7680x7680px (8K), JPEG\n- Made in Blender 3.0",
