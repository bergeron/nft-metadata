    "description": "Part of a series of black and white photos I took using my iPhone, depicting random moments of my life in Dubai.  \n\nMorning Glory was originally a pink rubber massage ball which I filtered the f*ck out of, so that it ended up resembling a morning star, a weapon used in medieval times.  I called it that because despite being an item used in the treatment of sore muscles, this thing hurts like hell.  ",
