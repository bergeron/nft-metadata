    "description": "By the end of the decade of the 1940, the Virreyes Hotel was built in the center of Mexico City. Its image -which appears on screen in Luis Buñuel´s Los Olvidados (The Young and the damned)- became one of the favorite spots for sport players, artists and elite celebrities of the time.\n\nAfter being well known both within Mexican and international elite classes, the Hotel was completely abandoned at the beginning of the 50, s. Not long ago -as part of Mexico City’s initiatives for recovery of its historical center- the Hotel reopened its doors after rescuing process, under the figure of hostel and residence, a meeting and reference point for the local artist community. \n\n¨Virreyes¨ is a project made in 2008/2009, while I was living in the Virreyes Hotel. This project is a chronicle made of interests and expectations, which imply a new meaning of the vital space and personal relationships. Tells a story of public intimacy, a denial of settle in, a new concept of belongingness and a duality between socialization and private life. \n\n",
