    "description": "The waiting room was empty and no sound could be heard,\nWhiteish felt like he was alone in the entire world.\n\nThan a sexy nurse approached him with a mocking smile\nand told him arrogantly “Sit down and wait awhile”.\n\nAfter which she went for a nurses lunch break,\nwithout giving a shit for his headache.\n\nThe head hurt so bad that he started to hallucinate a bit\nseeing doctors waiting in the room as patients and similar shit.\n\nStrange figures suddenly sat around in the room,\nWith sadness in their stand and faces made of gloom.\n\nThe temperature got him high like amphetamine,\nand suddenly he sees things the way he has never seen.\n\nThe provocatively uniformed nurse which was more than hot,\nmade him realise the following cognitive thought:\n\n“Here she is a health care worker and I am a dog with albinism,\nbut as soon as I get out of this building\nwe will both become actors in the society of consumerism.”\n\n“This fewer must have made me pathetic and cynic”,\nhe concluded and merged in the environment of clinic\nin the role of a patient in every sense,\namong imaginary people unable to pay private treatment expense.\n",
