    "description": "I wrote Never Want To Leave about falling in love. It happened at a time in my life where I least expected it. It was a love that burnt quickly and intensely but even in its brevity transformed me and how I saw the world. Itâ€™s about that initial feeling of falling for someone that feels like a dream that you wish you could stay in forever. ",
