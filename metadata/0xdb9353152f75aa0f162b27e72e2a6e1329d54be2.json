    "description": "There is an inexplicable life force within all of us. Some call it a soul, spirit, or essence, but at the end of the day, no one truly knows what it is or where it comes from. Yet, this mystery is part of what makes life beautiful. We all move along daily, doing, living, experiencing, suffering, enjoying, etc., all seemingly ignoring the fact that life is magical. Reality is fucking weird. Anyways, musing on this one day, I doodled this piece on my iPad and fell in love with it. I hope it brings you as much joy as it does me.  \nThank you for minting❤️",
