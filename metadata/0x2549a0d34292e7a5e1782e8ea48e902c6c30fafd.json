    "description": "Deep along the Southwest of Western Australia lies a stretch of shallow limestone reef that create some of the most unique water sculptures on the planet. \n\nOcean swells pour in from huge southern fronts that generate in the Antarctic. They march along unstoppable until reaching the shores of Western Australia. These waves break on such shallow shelves that water is dispersed in all different shapes and sizes. \n\nThis image is from the back of a wave after it has broken. Water boils out the back of the wave due to the sheer volume of water movement.\n\nThank you for enjoying this moment.",
