    "description": "It's hard to lose someone you love. It's even harder when you have to keep wandering the Earth alone, never knowing when or if you'll ever see them again. But that's the life of a drifter. You never stay in one place for long, always moving on to the next town, the next job, the next adventure. It's a lonely life, but it's the only life you know.",
