    "description": "This abstract composition is a visual representation of the unique and characteristic elements of a racetrack.\nRacing is a fight against time and against oneself, it is a battle to achieve the best possible time and push oneself to the limit. Only one driver can win the most prestigious trophy.\nAs drivers race along the track, their movements become robotic and they repeat them over and over until the end is announced. \nThe sensation of speed fuels this perpetual machine, however it is time that rules this reality. Drivers compete to shave seconds off their time and even the smallest mistake can be the difference between victory and defeat.\nThe racetrack is a place where time is the essence, and every second counts.",
