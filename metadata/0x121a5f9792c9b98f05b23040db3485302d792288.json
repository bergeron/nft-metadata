Still trying to party with you! \n\nHolders will be able to redeem a complementary music service by yours truly. Got a song you need mixed? Want to master it? Maybe it needs some guitar or drums? I gotchu, fam! \n\nEven if you’re not a musician, I bet you know one who’d absolutely love the gift of a music service. Especially, since studio time starts at $45-$75 per hour. \n\nNow Available: Lessons in Protools and Mixing! \nThat's right. To turn up even more, I want to turn you into a ProTools ninja. Additionally, we can go over basic mixing concepts. Just schedule a time and LFG!!\n\nHead to www.sayten89.com - where you’ll find examples of my work, and can sign up to a mailing list so we can stay in touch!",
