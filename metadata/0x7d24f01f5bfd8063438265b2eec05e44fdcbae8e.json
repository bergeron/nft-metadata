Sometimes you feel frustrated.  \nBut at any time, don't forget that.  \nRemember that you can smile.\n\nDon't give up smiling.  \nWhen you want to smile, do it without fear.\n\nWhen you smile, you are bright.  \nLike a twinkle.\n\nWhen I imagine you smiling like that, I feel like smiling.  \nThat's why I want to give you a smile.  \nBecause when you smile, I smile too.",
