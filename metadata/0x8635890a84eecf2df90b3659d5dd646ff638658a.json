    "description": "Are you watching or are they watching you? Who are we watching while living in paradise.\n\nCollectors club first ever open edition mint.  \nUse/burn this edition for a future edition within the Anonoverse.  \nYou will need at least 6 total \"Watching The Anonoverse\" to participate in each burn/trade for all new editions.\n\n\nA mesmerizing art piece that captures the essence of the vaporwave aesthetic. The vibrant colors and intricate details transport the viewer into a surreal, digital world where time seems to stand still. The piece features anonymous observing a Retro Monitor screen, symbolizing our constant surveillance in the modern age. The use of 80s inspired graphics adds to the nostalgic and dreamlike atmosphere of the piece.\n\nFor the culture of the club, we are inevitable. ",
