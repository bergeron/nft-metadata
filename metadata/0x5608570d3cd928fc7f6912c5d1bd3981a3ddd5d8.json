    "description": "The sun rises along the Southern Edge of Australia.\n\nLocation -31.577672, 130.162145  \nBunda Cliff's, South Australia.  \n\n210 kilometres (130 miles) long and 60 to 120 metres (200-390 feet) high, and made of Cenozoic age fossiliferous limestone, the Bunda Cliffs, also known as the Nullarbor Cliffs, and are a coastal scarp along the Southern Edge of Australia.\n\nPerched high above the Southern Ocean, with views all the way to Antarctica, this part of the land is often buffeted by gale force winds, big sea's or is melted under the Australian Summer sun.\n\nTaking attempt after attempt to find the right shutter speed, and the right amount of movement before the sun rise too far into the sky I had minimal time to make this photograph in the form of a painted work.  Thankfully my ICM skills came to the fore and this image was born.\n\nIntentional Camera Movement (ICM) involves the movement of the camera at a specific speed and/or direction during the operation of the shutter, resulting in a blurred image that still contains detail and a story of what it is about, and what it contains.\n\nThis image contains no AI nor Photoshop effects.",
