    "description": "After the extinction of humanity, a machine relives the life of its programmer and of all its ancestors. Within seconds, it has a primitive dream of an exuberant pilgrimage for which hardly any ruins remain. \n\n“The Last Movie on Earth – Run No. 1” is derived from the project The Last Movie on Earth, a movie that could be constantly remade by computers at any given moment. This NFT corresponds to the result of the run No. 001 of the prompt list, it was made using Disco Diffusion. It took a whole month to render.\n\nMusic by Miguel Isaza.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will be receiving a ProRes 422 mov file with a resolution of 1920 x 1152 px and an additional copy for loop displaying in FullHD.\n\nCinema will outlive us if generative art doesn’t kill it first.
