    "description": "We all have a little madness locked away inside. Let it out. Be bold. Be a little mad.\n\nMy internal madness started at a young age. The root of my madness being loss and grief. Connecting my childhood trauma to the launch of this collection was important so all the pieces were created on my childhood property.  It wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I learned to love my loss and appreciate my story with all the pain it held. There's beauty in the pain. There's beauty in the madness. \n\nMy hope through this collection is to help you pause and find a love for your madness.",
