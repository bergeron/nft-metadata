    "description": "As artists, something that we often overlook, even maybe attempt to hide, is the process of our works. The aftermath of mess we make in the midst of tediously perfecting what we wish to present to the world. \n\nThis drawing board has served as a multifaceted tool for my artistic endeavors from 2019 - 2022. Whether it be all I had as a table, a way to stop paint from bleeding through onto fabric, or even just a drawing board-- this masonite has seen me through many different times of my life and allowed me to create for the past 3 years. Throughout those years, every time I lifted the intentional works from this board and saw what lay beneath it, I found myself falling more & more in love with these bits and pieces that nobody was supposed to see. That weren't intentional or methodically placed. In return, it has transformed into a work of art itself.",
