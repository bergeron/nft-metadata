    "description": "I am proud to present Monoline Monroe as my inaugural design to kick off my Noodle Portrait collection. \n\nI am line artist Tyler Foust. My specialty is complex one line drawings that create an illusion of chaos up close but then become organized and clear from a distance. \n\nEach Noodle Portrait is originally hand drawn with ink on paper using one line that never intersects. \n\nEach week for the next 52 weeks I will release 1 new Noodle Portrait with 4 variations. \n",
