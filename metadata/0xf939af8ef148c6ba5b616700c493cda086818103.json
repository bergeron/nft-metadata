    "description": "JUMPSTARTCULTURE.PNG\n3150px x 4200px export from 6900px x 9200px .PSD \nsRGB\nAdobe Illustrator + Photoshop\nJune 2021\n\nMy personal 1986 Porsche 911 parked at Race Service in Los Angeles on a Thursday in 2019. The crew at RS had been a beacon of inspiration for me upon my return to California, and they welcomed me with incredible graciousness. They let me use their wifi once and I turned it into a weekly visit to the west side before heading to teach at ArtCenter. This occasion was the beginning of a still unresolved electrical issue where the car just randomly won't start without a jump. The supportiveness of everyone there offering ideas, tools, and experience to get my hoopty running again was truly one of the most wholesome moments I've experienced in car culture. \n\nOwnership of this NFT unlocks access to authenticated Gicle√© Prints at material cost, pre-sale access to future projects (including collaborations), and direct communication with the artist. All proceeds go toward the 911.",
