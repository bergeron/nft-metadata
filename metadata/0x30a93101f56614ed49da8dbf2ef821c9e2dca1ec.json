    "description": "Today’s healthcare system routinely sells your private details for remarkable sums of money. It is grounded in our current, inherently flawed web2 world of corporately owned services. In a web3 world, your privacy and health data are yours alone. Wealthcare is your window into that tomorrow.\n\nCrypto, decentralized blockchains, NFTs, and the ownership economy of web3 hold the future of healthcare. Discover how the metaverse provides innovative business models that are poised to revolutionize the way society approaches health. Wealthcare envisions what healthcare and wellness may look like when accidental wellness is a thing of the past.\n\nAs web3 technology reshapes finance, supply chain, social media, and other industries, Wealthcare presents a clear case for including healthcare privacy and innovation within this new reality. It explores areas where future transformation is possible and shines a light in places where it is already happening.\n\nTo read this book and access related features, visit https://alexandrialabs.xyz and connect your wallet.",
