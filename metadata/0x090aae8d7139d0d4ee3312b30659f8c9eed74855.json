    "description": "The theme of this work is anxiety and challenge.\n\nWhen I paint, I ask myself, \"Will people see this again?\". I'm often anxious.\nI wish to break through my \"anxious\" and \"timid\" feelings and challenge myself and grow in the world of NFT. I painted this work with the wish in mind.\nThis work, which features a composition and color scheme that I had never painted before, contains many of my challenges.\n\nEverything is a big challenge for me now.\nAnd I feel a lot of pressure and anxiety about everything.\nHowever, I think it's a necessary experience to start something new and to be successful.\n\nA girl is cutting marvel of Peru, which means \"timidity\", and geranium, which means \"melancholy\" in the flower language, with a sword.\nGloriosa is attached to the sword, and she's wearing a gerbera hair ornament.\nThey have the flower language of \"bravery\" and \"progress\", respectively.\n\nCarp is lucky charm that rises high up against the current.\nI want to continue to take on challenges and grow further.",
