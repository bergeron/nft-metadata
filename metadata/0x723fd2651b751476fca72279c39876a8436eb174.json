    "description": "In the human soul there is an image of home.\nThe image of home is a place of strength and serenity, a support for all times. The image of home is the point from which you can start all over again. You can smile and cry, remembering the home where you were born and grew up, but you will never forget it.\nThe blue-haired Soul keeps an image of home.",
