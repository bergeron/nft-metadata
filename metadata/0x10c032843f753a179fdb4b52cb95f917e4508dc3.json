It burns hot to illuminate the path ahead and warm the soul within.\n\nThe Automatic Abstractions collection is a collection of artworks that begin as 1-2 hour automatic meditative drawings.  When the mind is clear and the meditative process is complete, the works are then further refined into what you see here.  These are the works of my subconscious.",
