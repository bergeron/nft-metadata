    "description": "My Dear Acanthus‚Äù story that started in the year 2018, 2 years into my journey as an artist.  At the time I was learning to imitate the outline of an acanthus plant. An action that later evolved into learning about its symbolism of immortality, healing and resurrection.  \nA fitting representation for a moment that would mark the birth of a line art style that was birthed from the need for self expression, longevity and meditation.",
