    "description": "Inspired by Miripolsky’s original  iconic  Juggler painting circa 1986 and brought to life again in the image today’s master juggler - Donald J. Trump\n\nI found myself more and more concerned for the country having Mr. Trump juggling all of our lives on his very own private highwire.\n\nOn this latest collaboration I've worked with original owner of The Juggler painting to create a most timely, ironically humorous political statement for our time. \"You never have to remember, if you tell the TRUTH.\"\n\nMy intention is to launch this first edition and to follow with more in this collection. All inspired by Mr. Trump's words and actions.\n\n",
