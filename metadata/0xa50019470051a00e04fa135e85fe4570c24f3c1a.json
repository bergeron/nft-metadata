    "description": "Plant Hugs is the first step in a journey to shape a community into a decentralized publishing company. It’s a children’s board book featuring five characters, from the NFT collection PlantSwap and a parody of Will Lady Bug Hug by Hilary Leung. Owners of a Plant Hugs NFT are invited to join the community and are able to participate in bringing this first book to market.\n\nThe purchase of each Plant Hugs NFT includes a physical copy of the Plant Hugs board book, claimable after the initial production printing. Book claims will be granted to each wallet holding a Plant Hugs NFT at the time of the snapshot.",
