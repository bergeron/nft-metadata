    "description": "Serum 27 is the proposed cure that SerumLabz has created for the Mutant Kongz. These tokens will be the key asset for the 2 brand-new collections which will be the result of freeing the Kongz of radiation. Our labs have run several tests and trials to assure its success. When placing this Serum into our Lab's Regen System you will receive a Humanoid NFT as well as a new Clone Kong NFT, both which will be stakeable assets.",
