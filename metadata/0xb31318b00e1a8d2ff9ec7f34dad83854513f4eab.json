    "description": "After three weeks in the Unknown trying to track down the Giant Dweller that brought havoc to the water meadows back at Oasis Mur-Na, Eddie finally comes across a fresh kill. The slashes in the prey’s hide couldn’t be mistaken for anything else than a Dweller’s attack. \nThe prey is still painfully breathing. That means the predator is close.  \nEddie wishes he didn't separate from his companions, but fuck it, he's lucky enough he found this Elder’s Staff during this hunting expedition and is ready to use it to slay the Dweller. However this staff works. Let's hope it works.",
