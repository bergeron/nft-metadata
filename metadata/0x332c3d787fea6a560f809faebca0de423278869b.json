    "description": "Gigantic titans shaking the earth's firmament, giant moths flying over the ruins and carnivorous plants sprouting from the ground already notice the newcomer. These creatures build up a symphony of sounds merging together, giving rise to a semblance of an alien melody.\nAyo looks around this world, with his dark eyes, through the prism of bright colors and absorbs every detail, and stupefied, with delight and open mouth, he notices the path that lies through deep menthol waters.\nIn the raging calm of an unearthly acidic sea, in the depths of which unimaginable chthonic creatures live, dotted with hundreds of eyes and tentacles, as well as those who are completely beyond description.\nThis world is full of bright colors that erupt from a living volcano, which is getting bigger right before our eyes. Carefully! Its multi-colored hot drops can hurt you!\n\nArtsit : katerilian\nType : mp4, 4724 x 3322 px.",
