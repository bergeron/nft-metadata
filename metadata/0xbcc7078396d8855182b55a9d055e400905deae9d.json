    "description": "\"**Master Photographer Jan C. Schlegel** captures the essence of people in an extraordinary way, evidencing his passion for classical photography and his sensitivity towards nature. His work takes us on a journey through unconventional geographies with precise mastery. Respect for the language of the body dwells in the exquisite perfection of the image. In the midst of the digital age we live in, Schlegel opts for the darkroom photographic tradition. His exact knowledge of the instruments and the development process is surprising when the visual result of the positive is obtained.\"\n(Maylin PÃ©rez, Art Curator)\n\nThe entire [**Essence series**](https://janschlegel.photography) contains more than 200 pictures and will be released as 1/1 NFT's. This is the very first drop in that collection. \n\n**Jan C Schlegel is represented by some international art galleries and is exhibiting his works around the world. \nHis works are shown at art fairs in Paris, Miami, Basel, NY, Singapur, London...**",
