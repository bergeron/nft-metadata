    "description": "Introducing the Letterverse, a breathtaking and profound journey into the soul of British indie singer-songwriter Josh Savage. This transcendent album, titled “Another Life” on Spotify, captures the essence of human connection, love, and longing. The concept behind “Love Letters” revolves around two pen pals who first met in Paris and continued to visit each other all over the world, only to be permanently separated during the pandemic. Their heartfelt letters inspired this emotional and inspiring collection of songs. \n For the first time, an entire album has been converted to a metaverse, with worlds built around the themes of the songs. If you go through each world, you’ll also be rewarded with a POAP for being there at the start of this brand new art form!",
