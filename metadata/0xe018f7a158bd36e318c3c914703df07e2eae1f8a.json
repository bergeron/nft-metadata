    "description": "The largest burrowing bird of the hen family. His main occupation is rummaging through the depths of the internet for sustenance. It feeds primarily on crypto larvae and meta bots. The characteristic coloration makes it difficult for him to camouflage, but thanks to him, no collector can resist him. It is in danger of extinction."
