    "description": "The central figure in the paintings is Mother Earth herself, presented in a dapper but frail appearance, embodying both her resilience and the impact of our actions on the natural world.\n\nThe strange and unsettling biological creature she holds serves as a potent symbol of humankindâ€™s greed, arrogance and individualism. The creatures remind us that our actions have consequences beyond our own individual lives.\n\nThe imagery highlights the delicate balance between human action and natural consequence. At the same time, the frail appearance of Mother Earth reminds us of our own mortality and the finite nature of the resources we so often take for granted.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus.",
