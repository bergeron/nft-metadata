    "description": "Calabasas Cave creatures is A community driven collectibles project, it features Cavemen from the land of Caverium. In the beginning, cavemen roamed the blockchains of Caverium in search of treasures to bring home in the form of food and items to trade for food. This caused wars and bloody brawls between the Cavemenians. Till the great collapse of Caverium which was a result of society being so consumed by the warring, no one had time to notice the massive blizzard coming before it already set in and covered Caverium in a sheet of hard rock-solid ice. Thousands of years later Caverium is now known to the modern world as Calabasas, California. The cavemen are thawing out one by one and they are set out to conquer this new world for all its treasures",
