    "description": "This unreleased secret part of a series of works about a tragedy that took place in 79 B.C. Archaeologists from all over the world still continue archaeological work at Pompeii. \nWhat did the people experience on that Judgment Night? Were they aware of the impending end? Did they pray to the gods? What would I have done if I had been there? \n\nThese were the questions that ran through my mind as I created this work. Through artistic imagery, I bring the viewer to the theme of \"Discourse on Death. We have no control over our lives and at any moment death can catch up with us. Life is fleeting. \n\nTo be honest, looking at this picture you can ask a lot of philosophical questions about life and death, about God, about fate, about the transience of life and much more. Everyone can find something for themselves in this subject.",
