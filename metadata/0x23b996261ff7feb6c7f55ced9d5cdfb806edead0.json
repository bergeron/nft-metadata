    "description": "It was a warm summer morning in East London. As we walked around trying to find the best spot for the final photo, I asked Cyclop Man (nickname for the Cirque du Soleil circus artist underneath the mask who asked to remain anonymous) if he could pose outside a warehouse for a moment.\n\nThe mask was purchased at a dress-up shop in London's Camden called Escapade that since got shut down.   \n\nThe final photograph that ended up as part of 'Naked with Masks' was photographed not far from this location, at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, with London Stadium in the background.\n\n   \n\nJuly 31, 2015. Fish Island, Hackney Wick, London, UK.",
