    "description": "\"I had a dream that I died in my sleep, and my heroes were singing my songs\" \n\nbtw, 100 editions of this song absolutely terrifies me. But the thing is, I wanted to allow the most collectors into my funeral as possible.. I want this release to be a party!! But a reflective, in depth, life-is-short kind of party.. I hope this song makes you feel and makes you think... What is it you truly want to leave behind? What is a legacy? Who is there, at your funeral? \n\nSometimes I get caught up in a lot of the insignificant pieces of life, I think maybe we all do? But what I truly want most out of my life is big funeral at the end of it, with weed and whiskey. Fine, and I also want Marcus Mumford and Brandi Carlile to duet one of my songs.\n;)\n\nBIG FUNERAL\nwritten/produced by : \nKathleen Regan & Kid Elliot\nartwork by :\nInterrobang \n\n\nPS. can you spot some of my fave artists / influences in the artwork?
