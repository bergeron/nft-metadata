    "description": "Desert Cuts // Scar Tissue\n\nMy work, whether photographic, conceptual or digital in origin, explores the intersection of architecture and the environment using a photographic bias.\n\nMy series on Foundation // SCAR TISSUE // is an observation, through photography, on the effect of 'architecture' (humans) on the environment around us.\n\nThe work aims to contrast the plethora of perfectly edited beautiful landscape images that saturate our screens daily with the question as to whether 'ugly' can look beautiful as photographic art? ... and simultaneously have a deeper meaningful subtext.",
