    "description": "Human from onset were devoid of knowledge, they were blind to what is GOOD and EVIL even though GOOD and EVIL existed before the creation of man. God created man for the purpose of intimate fellowship with him but wanted them to do it out of their own free will-not forcing them into it. So he had to create a channel that would make him achieve that purpose which is the \"TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL\"\n\nThis is the fundamental of self discovery-spiritual discovery.\n\nBut first and most importantly seek (aim at, strive after) His kingdom and His righteousness [His way of doing and being rightâ€”the attitude and character of God], and all these things will be given to you also.  \nMathew 6 vs 33 Amplified version",
