    "description": "I created a place to turn to in search of peace when life is agitated. A place away from criticism where I can sink into my own company and find a moment of tranquility.  \nHowever, even with the utopian nature of this limbo, I find myself in the middle of a trap which sinks me deeper and deeper into my own thoughts, paralyzing me and preventing me from taking action in the real world.  \nRegardless of this, I always manage to return, because I know that there I will find the calm and comfort I need to face this hilarious reality.",
