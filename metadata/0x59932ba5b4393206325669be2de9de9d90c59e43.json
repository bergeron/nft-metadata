    "description": "### Block #0002\n> Through the “Block Bang” it all starts with a tiny block. Then, within the blink of an eye, it quickly multiplies and expands to a universe that consists of generated digital species. In fact, everything in here is actually made of the same block dust. However, they have their own identities, purposes, and lifetime. Within the “Block Bang”, that uniqueness is represented by different color palettes and patterns. Each of 1000 NFTs utilizes a unique palette consisting of a 6-color combination which is randomly distributed throughout 4096 cubes by a carefully designed algorithm. Also, each NFT contains a unique pattern that aims to provide an identity.\n\n``` You can Click/Tap & Rotate the blocks ```",
