    "description": "Inspired by the Temple of Vesta, which was dedicated to the cult of Vesta, the goddess of hearth and home. The vestal virgins maintained the eternal holy hearth of the city of Rome. The sacred hearth was not allowed to go out, because it was regarded as a bad omen. The Temple was also used to store sacred objects: As long as these objects were kept safe, so a prophecy proclaimed, Rome would remain safe.",
