    "name": "Forest God. Chapter One",
    "description": "This face had come to me in my dreams a thousand times.\nThe animal that saved me when I was dying in an acid trip in the woods.\n\nThe protruding tongue is the trademark of the Maori tribe. The indigenous people of New Zealand. The Maori were one of the most violent and hardy peoples of the ancient world. They painted their faces and bodies in a frightening way, and during dances they intensify this effect by sticking out their tongue. This signifies a challenge to the enemy and disregard for danger\n\nThe forest god glows from within. He scales and anticipates danger. His heart sounds like Hung. He is ready to tear apart anyone who would want to harm him and his home.\nThis mask opens this collection. It is the most important to me, the most revealing. It's about the rage in my heart. The powerful energy of the forest, the mystical experience I had there.",
