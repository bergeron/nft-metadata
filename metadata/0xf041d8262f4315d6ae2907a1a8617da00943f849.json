    "description": "Though at first glance this painting might be anxiety provoking for anyone with a beard, it truly demonstrates trust, support and affection between two couples. These qualities, in my opinion, are fundamental to foster a healthy relationship. They are Sharing each other's space very intimately as though they are one entity. \n\nI love this piece because it has a very subtle vibe with the simple clothing, the way they are sitting, the closeness and the trees surrounding them. This cottage lifestyle looks absolutely tranquil, celebrating simple living, a rural countryside esque which steps away from modernity.\n",
