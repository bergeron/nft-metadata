    "description": "Created with AI using only textual prompts Hooper describes the vast indigo sea by which she lives and its many ways of being to her DALL·E. To preserve the authenticity of the AI response to her poetic words the artist does not use editing or out-painting. She only adds a digital seal (her Chinese name 蔡金娜 Choy Gina) acknowledging the tradition in which her craft is rooted and rotates the DALL·E watermark to act as a second seal, symbolising Hooper’s use of AI as a medium and in acknowledgement of DALL·E as something of a co-collaborator.",
