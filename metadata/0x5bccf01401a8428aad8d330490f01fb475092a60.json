    "description": "Meet '2871', a once powerful woman turned condemned felon by the ruthless Federal Enforcer. Her thirst for power left her shackled to an eternal nightmare in the horrific Underworld.\n\nWhen the alarm of Cadaver Inc. tolls, it signals 'The Purge', a merciless game where inmates are hunted, not for death, but for torment. Every inflicted wound promises an excruciating cycle of damage and unnaturally rapid repair - a dance of suffering that never ends.\n\nAs the alarm sounds, 2871 launches into a desperate run. It's not death she fears, but the prospect of enduring another Purge. Her frantic dash is not for escape, but a desperate bid for the merest breath of relief in an eternally suffocating existence.",
