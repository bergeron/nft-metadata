    "description": "In light of events, over the past 2 years, the same question has been haunting me. If people make time for hatred and various types of intolerance, do they have time at all?\nParadox!!!  \nNowadays we have high technology, but low tolerance. Wide developed infrastructure, but very narrow views. We spend more but have less, buy more but enjoy less.\nWe have bigger houses, but smaller families; better amenities, but less time to enjoy them.\nWe have a better education, but less intelligence. We have access to the best knowledges, but the way we access a situation is getting worse and worse... We have more experts, but also more problems.  It would seems that we have better medicine, but worse health.",
