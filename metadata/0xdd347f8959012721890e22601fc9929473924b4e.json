    "description": "Introducing The Beauty of Rebellion by Abell Octovan, challenging the notion of beauty in todayâ€™s society. The ballerina is all geared up with a vest and mask, holding a smoke grenade, and twirling in the midst of a rebellion. Highlighted with a red accent is the spray can, a representation of the desire to break free from the beauty conventions we all know. This NFT will be linked only to you, a cryptographic token is assigned and acts as a unique identifier of the art collectible that you physically own. As such, the digital asset you own is as scarce and exclusive (read: highly sought after) as the physical asset. When you trade The Beauty of Rebellion to someone else, its ownership can be transferred by trading both the physical and digital assets. You may trade your The Beauty of Rebellion NFT on open marketplaces such as OpenSea.",
