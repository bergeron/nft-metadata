    "description": "In the Clouds was taken near the summit of Ben Lomond. I happened to stop and turn around to look back at where we had walked from, and along the side was this ridge that we hadn't noticed because of the clouds. \n\nI'm so glad that I turned around when I did, because by the time we came back from the summit the cloud had completely cleared. It was a totally different landscape!\n\nThis moment and this shot really lit a fire in me to push on with my photography. It also encouraged me to stop and take in my surroundings. Not only do I love the shot itself, it taught me a lot and has been the defining shot in my photography journey so far.",
