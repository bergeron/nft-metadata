    "description": "2022 it's the year in which I was displayed at Biennale di Venezia. One of the most important exhibitions in the World. When I was there, with my fam, I was planning to find a way to make a tribute to this incredible event, and when I woke up early in the morning, I discovered that Venice was giving me a present. Find St. Mark's square fully flooded with the perfect level of water to have this reflection it's unique. I also noticed a girl, dressed in a beautiful way, and she was there, doing I dunno what, but was like she was waiting to be caught by me, to be immortalized in that amazing moment.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with unlimited participants.
