    "description": "This image titled \"Skyward Divisions\" is a photo I took on the fourth evening of my backpacking trip. At sunset, the sky's color split in two, half blue, half pink. It created an otherworldly frame for a photograph and was one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever witnessed.\n\n\"Western Worlds\" is a collection of photographs I took on a trip out to Utah last summer. The landscape changed so often that each photo feels like a snapshot from a different world.",
