    "description": "To the north of Burra, South Australia lays a stone hut, it was made famous by the incredible photographer, Ken Duncan when one of his photos of this hut was used on the cover of the Diesel and Dust album by Australian band Midnight Oil. The hut became iconic, so much so that when it started falling apart people put together a fund raiser to restore it.\n\nThis photo was me trying to find my unique angle and idea of a heavily photographed icon, I wanted to put the midnight into the “Midnight Oil Hut”, this is what I came up with. I sat on this image for the longest time as I wasn’t initally happy with the processing of it… as technology has improved I’ve been able to process it better and now it is ready to be printed and minted.\n\n1 of 1",
