    "description": "This story started when I got (OCD) obsessive-compulsive disorder, I was constantly thinking about what is going on inside my brain and what is the difference between me and a normal person? The answer to this question is difficult, but after the doctors' examination, I wanted to understand as much as possible what the doctors see in my EEG tests and brain scans.\nI'm not a data scientist but I'm interested in them, So I decided to try, with the help of my doctor and check the EEG frequencies in the simplest way and I try to convert them into frequencies in a numerically identifiable range with the help of programming. So that I can create artistic images that are as consistent as possible with the actual frequencies that come from different people's brains and see the difference between them.\n\nFull description on my Twitter \nRead about Epilepsy disorder on Wikipedia\n\nEEG Devise+Matlab+Python+Touchdesigner\nThanks to Bileam Tschepe (elekktronaut) for the Touchdesigner tutorial\n6000PX",
