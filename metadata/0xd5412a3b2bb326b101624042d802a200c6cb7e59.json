    "description": "Settled class tribes are the fourth rarest of the four tribal classes in the Banana Kingdom. This is the Banana Kingdom's middle class. Only 250 Settled tribes exist in each region. Holding a Settled class NFT will give you 20 tribal member slots in the region marked on this NFT. As a tribal Chieftain of a Settled class tribe you earn 5% of all tokens spent on crafting by all members of your tribe, and are in charge of all distributing all items your tribe wins in the Tournament of the Settled â€” a monthly tournament exclusive to this class. Your tribe members will also enjoy slightly elevated earnings and payouts by percentage that are higher than Unknown Class tribes.",
