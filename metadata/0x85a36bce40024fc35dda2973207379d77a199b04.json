This Christmas song or more precisely this Anti - Christmas song is a musical sarcasm from Jonathan Illel and Damien Vandesande. They have a long tradition started 20 years ago of reuniting and composing a song on that night.\ndOP could not resist to bring some irony, play with the sacred and illuminate some darker angles of this celebration.\n\nListen: https://open.spotify.com/track/5Uc5n5mD31YXDO5Aymrg8F?si=jOWcjPsUS7qYb2QJr7lrjg\n\nSubscribe on https://www.nephelsdream.com to be informed of the next releases and exhibitions. \n\nMore information about dOP: https://linktr.ee/dOP\n\nFirst collector will receive a signed BW original hand-drawing and receive a limited edition of vinyl ‘Nephel’s Dream’ signed by dOP.\n\n•••\n\nOn permanent display at the digital part of Louvre, Paris since 2023\n\nSize: 6940 x 9836 pixels, 600 dpi",
