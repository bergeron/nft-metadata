    "description": "Act 1, Scene 6. \"IRL\"\n\nWFH DEGEN hit the breaking point. He had become so consumed with Web3 and NFTs that he was starting to lose sight of the things that mattered IRL. He had been working from home for 3+ years now and had hardly left his apartment. Friendships were fading, and isolation was settling in. DEGEN realized that he needed to disconnect and take a break from everything. He sent milo the dog to his parents' house and set off to find some clarity.\n\nAs he sat on the rooftop of his staycation hotel, looking out at the city, he realized how much he had been missing out on. The sunset was breathtaking, and the sounds from the chaos below created the art he had been longing for. As he sipped on his Hopium, he could feel the weight of the world lifting off his shoulders. \"Here's to you,\" he said, raising his glass to the city. \n\nWas this the start of a new chapter?",
