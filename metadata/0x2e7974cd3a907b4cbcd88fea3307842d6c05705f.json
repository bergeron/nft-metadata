    "description": "While many yokai are dangerous and alien, the Tenome are particularly predatory and malicious. They are similar to vampires but feed on victims' bones rather than blood, and it is said that victims of the Tenome are thus left as nothing more than a pile of skin, with the spirit supposedly magically consuming all the bones from their bodies.",
