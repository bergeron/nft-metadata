    "description": "The first step to being whole is to acknowledge that somewhere along the way, fragments of us were left behind. \n\nThis is an intimate lament to our inner child, a moment in the past where our world made sense, an ex lover, a lost friend. \n\nThis was my first recognition that I felt broken. My first cry for help. The first ray of light, that managed to crack the shell of darkness around me. \n\nThis poem began my journey of self healing and I hope it does the same for you. ",
