These photographs were made between 2010 and 2015. \n\nThis is one of my favorite photographs from the project, because to me it represents hope and resilience in the face of a difficult environment. Physical prints of this photograph are in numerous private collections as well as the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n1/1 NFT\n\n4500x3598 pixels",
