    "description": "The Transfiguration of Concepts collection delves into the essence of transformation, focusing on the interplay and contrast between the synthetic and organic aspects of metamorphosis.\n\nIn this collection, all the artworks are AI-generated images derived from my original physical artwork, serving as a foundation to produce synthetic art that mirrors traditional artistic styles. The intriguing twist lies in the fact that these AI-generated images will subsequently be translated onto canvas, thereby transforming them back into physical art once more.\n\nThe funds obtained from the sales will be allocated towards the acquisition of essential tools required for the transformation of the AI images into physical paintings on canvas, with dimensions approximately measuring 42cm x 59.4cm.\n\nPhysical painting will be held for an exhibition and afterwards will be sent to the collector of primary market. All the details in DMs",
