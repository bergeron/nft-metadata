    "description": "The color red is at the end of the visible light spectrum.\n\nThroughout human history, this color has played an important role.\nOchre-based red pigment was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. Ancient Egyptians dyed their faces red for religious ceremonies, while Roman generals dyed their bodies red to celebrate victories.\n\nRed has long been associated with sacrifice and bravery, as it is the color of blood.\n\nWhen I think of the sacrifices I've made in my career as an artist, I'm reminded of the courage I've needed at times to continue down this path into the unknown.\n\nThen I remind myself that without fear, there is no bravery.",
