This expression means that everything is fine or everything is going as planned. Stou introduces a No melo loop of 16 bars and about 9 different flows in this song.\nHe offers several punchlines, both funny and light, but always full with a deep meaning. The song is a mixture of humorous provocation but very thoughtful and theatrical.\n\nGiveaway\n\n- QR code to access to a concert during the year\n- Limited High quality Merch",
