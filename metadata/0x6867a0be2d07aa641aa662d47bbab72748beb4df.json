    "description": "The future was a great place to live, a world without violence, without suffering, and without war. \nThat was thanks to the intelligent decision made long ago to outlaw physical weapons of destruction and instead introduce \"Idea Guns\". \nThe \"Idea Guns\" are no longer capable of firing bullets, but instead, allow people to shoot ideas to each other and create a better world.\n\nWhen people disagreed, or had different perspectives or concepts, they would suit up in the appropriate gear, set the ideas in their minds, and fire out a barrage of creative thoughts. \nNo one was harmed, but ideas could clash, spark controversy, or fly away and trigger change all over the world. \nIt was a peaceful, creative way for mankind to express themselves and better the world, something humans had been striving for ages.",
