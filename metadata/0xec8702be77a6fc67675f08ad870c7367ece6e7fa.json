    "description": "The idea we are cups that pour out as we go throughout our day is interesting idea like we only have so many spoons or anything you want to use metaphorically works to. It explains the energy draining aspect of our day but do we see that we are empty when the drain is subtle or so we see it when we have had enough and don't know why? Is it the way we live or the way we have to live?",
