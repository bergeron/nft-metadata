    "description": "A recreation of tenting and boating with my parents way back in the late 80's. We always took a starlight paddle to gaze up at the universe. What a profound impact that had many years later. \n\nI can't wait to continue this tradition with my wife my newborn son. \n\nCaptured on the A1 at 20mm while the milky way rose over the trees at Two Jack Lake, just outside of Banff. I've setup here many times over the last 16 years but have rarely seen the water so still that the stars perfectly reflect. What a night!",
