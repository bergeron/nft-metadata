    "description": "Radiant is an original artwork created using Oil/ Acrylic paint mediums\nThe intending idea of radiant is to create a painting that portrays positivity and happiness\nHow it radiates on us\nHow we're able to light up dark places being who we are and how that positive radiation can be transferred to our surrounding\nBeing RADIANT is about embracing ones own divinity, and i believe that if we're able to do that, we can rise above negativity and shine like radiant beings that we are.\nWe have a choice",
