    "description": "Artist: Joao Angelini\n\nYear: 2021\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nTechnique: Digital Photograph\n\nDimensions: 6000 x 4000 px\n\nAbout the series: In “Tudo que é sólido…” [All that is solid...] the narrative relationships established by the work's imagery vocabulary (white marble, cubes, landscapes devastated by agribusiness) raise issues related to territorial occupation, progress, and ecocide. The concepts are amplified by the situation of suspension of this cube (symbol of modernity) which, through the photographic gesture of appropriation of the instant, remains intact in the air in the same step that falls for the eternity.\n\nThe title of the work, “Tudo que é sólido…” , presents us with a classic incomplete sentence by Marx, which at the same time is the title, also incomplete, of another work by Berman. This choice directs the discussion of the work about the adventures and horrors, the ambiguities, and ironies of modern life, also represented by the white cub",
