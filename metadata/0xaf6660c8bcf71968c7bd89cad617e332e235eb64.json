    "description": "The world feels so big, doesn’t it?\n\nWe’re all scared and that’s okay. \nThe world is going through a tough time, I know.  \nPlease, have a walk. Loneliness is just part of being human, because you are trying to remember who you truly are. No matter if you’re a loner or have the fear of being alone, just remind yourself that you’re never really alone. An ode to everyone going through a hard time. \n\nThis is ‘A Lonely Walk’ : a unique topdown street view shot by yours truly.\n\nArtist: Naty  \nName: A Lonely Walk \nEdition: 20/20  \nLocation: Milan, Italy  \nYear: 2022  \nSize: 4834 x 7248  \nGear: Sony a7RIII - Sony 85mm F1.8 \nGenre: Street Photography",
