    "description": "Original photograph 4 1/4 x 2 3/4 inches\n\nA/SLEEP represents a digitized portion of Rose Bishop’s collection devoted to found snapshots of sleeping people. Sleep has inspired artistic expression across the centuries—from the resting marble nymphs of ancient Athens to Andy Warhol’s five hour anti-film of John Giornio sound asleep. This visual trope is also represented in popular photographic practices. In the snapshot bin of any thrift store one will inevitably stumble upon a photograph of someone sleeping.\n\nAt once intimate and invasive, these images build upon the aestheticization of sleep through the technology of photography. Like cryogenically-frozen bodies, photographic sleepers lay in perpetual slumber. Although the personal specificity of these snapshots are lost, photography’s realism produces the illusion of historical immediacy in rich visual detail. The snapshots of A/SLEEP attempt to document the dreams of everyday people — picturing friends, family members, lovers, and the occasional stranger. The collection numbers well-over 500 individual images taken between the 1870s-1970s, sourced exclusively from online sellers.\n\nBy releasing a selection of these snapshots back onto the internet, Bishop seeks to preserve and share these photographs on a digital platform. Owners of these NFTs have the opportunity to redeem the one-of-a-kind physical snapshot, mailed directly to them.\n\nThe form for physical redemption of the photographs will be made available in September, 2022 for all NFT holders.",
