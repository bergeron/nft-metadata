    "description": "Music NFT & song collaboatration from Jadyn Violet and Twinny Twin: Twinny Twin’s crib music and Jadyn Violet’s melodies have came together to create a musical piece that highlights storytelling. After the release of genesis projects “Twinesis” and “Violet Token\", the two thought it be best to channel the emotions caused by recent events into a song that can be related to real life. This time, we wanted to focus on the actual music and the context behind it.",
