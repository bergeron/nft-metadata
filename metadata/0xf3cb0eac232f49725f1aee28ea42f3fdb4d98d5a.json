    "description": "This virtual art glass sculpture is based on my real world \"Architectonic Photo Cube\" design, which won 1st prize in a competition on instructables.com in 2011. In this project, I sought to develop a novel framing mechanism of purposeful extravagance for displaying five images printed on glass. Rather than focusing on the imagery alone and allowing the framing mechanism to disappear–or perhaps just play a minor supporting role (literally)–I chose to celebrate the display architecture as well as my own former life as an architect.",
