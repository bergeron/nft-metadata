    "description": "Doesn't it seem as if the sands cover up some secrets of the road just like how we cover up our secrets and lies with something? Or is there the missing part of this road? Or better said, does the love and support that we show others really exist? Do we lack real love for others? Aren't we just pretending to care? We got ourselves thousands of problems which need to be taken care of and therefore got ourselves no time to work through the problems of others, especially in today's world where everyone is busy with their smartphone. Or does the sand hide the imperfections of the road just like how we cover ours with different things? Or maybe the good top surface of this road and the sand just hides the bad/evil/sad bit of the road in a way how we decide to put an happy face on, although we are sad and depressed inside, or as said earlier, how we show people that we actually care about them but in the end we don't. The questions keep on raising.\nLocation: Abu Dhabi, U.A.E",
