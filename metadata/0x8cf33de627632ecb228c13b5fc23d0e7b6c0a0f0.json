    "description": "The lonely being watched from a distance as the planet slowly decayed and its inhabitants tore one another apart. He could feel their desperation and their pain, but he knew that he must stay away from the infighting. He found a kind of peace in his solitude, and although he was alone, he still felt a sense of happiness and contentment that could not be found among the chaos. He was determined to remain a silent observer, in the hope that one day the planet would be restored to its former glory.",
