    "description": "We are surrounded by many objects that we sometimes do not even notice. Items that perform a certain function in human life, which appear and disappear in the urban environment surrounding us, to make our space cozy, convenient, comfortable.\nBut what if you remove everything from the urban environment and leave only objects created by people for temporary use: scaffolding, goats, fencing structures. They become independent art objects, beautiful in their absurdity, angularity, imperfection. A chaotic installation arises, the structure of which is constantly changing with the participation of various people. Every day a person brings or takes away an object, using it in his work, thereby creating a new composition, unlike the previous one. \n\n2018-2020 | St. Petersburg, Russia",
