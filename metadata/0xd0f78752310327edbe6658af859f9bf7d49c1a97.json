    "description": "Remember Us V is our work encompassing digital tributes to five incredible women across five centuries - artists and legends who have stood the test of time against the odds of male domination. With a piece channeling Helen Frankenthaler’s iconographic colour field technique at the centre, we bring forth our recreation of works by Berthe Morisot from the 1800’s, Rose Adélaïde Ducreux from the 1700’s, Artemisia Gentileschi from the 1600’s & Sofonisba Anguissola from the 1500’s. For ‘Remember Us V’ our digital reworking honouring five art historical figures bridges across five centuries to the present day with the important reminder that women were always part of art history’s canon.",
