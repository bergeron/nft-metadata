    "description": "Art is a golden river of magic, and every artist is a wizard who creates that magic. Minerva is the first artist and goddess of art, born in the golden waters of magic. Minerva has an unusual appearance. She looks like an ancient tree in which the blue juices of life flow. Any tree needs care and love. A blue bird hides in her hair. And a hand of pure gold holds a pencil. I took a personal photograph as the basis of the goddess. Now I want to tell you about the symbols of this work and explain their meaning in simple terms  \nThe hand of the Goddess is golden for a reason. The artist's hands nourish it. Thanks to his hands, the artist creates art, which forever leaves its mark on life. Many artists have become famous. It is impossible to create without hands.\n\nThe bird and GN/GM symbols are associated with the artist's advancement. These days, many artists sell their work on Twitter. Twitter lives all day and all night. We are a big family. Without promotion, the artist will disappear. Like a tree will die without 💧 \n\nThe candle symbolizes time. It is not eternal. Like the life of an artist or the flowering of his work.\n\n",
