    "description": "Being alone in the dark can get your heart pumping as you move cautiously through each room, unsure of what might jump out at you next. Every creak, groan, and shadow causes your mind to race with fear, and you can feel sweat building on your skin as you struggle to maintain control. The sense of unease and terror is overwhelming, making it feel like it's almost impossible to escape the haunting presence that surrounds you.",
