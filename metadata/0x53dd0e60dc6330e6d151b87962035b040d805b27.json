    "description": "I've always had an extreme affinity for geometric works.  \nSomething about the negative space and the balance of  \nshape and form that creates a sort of zen, like a Japanese  \ngarden or ripples on a still lake. This piece, the first on ETH (others minted on Tezos) in the series harkens to the work of Kazimir Severinovich Malevich. Kazimir was a Russian avant-garde artist and art theorist,  \nwhose work and writing had a profound influence on the  \ndevelopment of abstract art in the 20th century. Abstraction and geometric form leave to the imagination to ask, what do I see in this piece, how does it relate to the way I feel? ",
