    "description": "This is an exact description from my IRL Friend “Gigi Butterly”\n\n“Marta Is 24” tall and enjoys quiet walks on the beach, taking time to smell the flowers and working on her rainbow hair.  She is a happy girl and likes to spread her cheer”\n\nMarta is fashioning my favourite pair of army capris, which I wore til their death in Africa when I bent to pick something up and tore a giant slash in the butt.  I fixed it several times, but alas, I had worn the fabric out.  Her dress is one of the army pockets and she can bundle her flowers into the pocket for her long walks and hand them out to whoever she wishes...\n\nThese Dolls are available in real life for $500CND plus shipping \n\nGigi Butterfly Website http://www.gigibutterfly.com/\n\nGigi is a special special women that helped me at a time of mental need, she took me for Forest walks and listened and listened. I wish to give back \n\nThese remind me of “Mr Rogers Neighborhood” \n\nThank you for supporting out journey ",
