    "description": "People with an eating disorder are often haunted by destructive thoughts, especially when they are alone or trying to eat. \nThese thoughts are different for each person with an eating disorder, I've depicted mine. \nWhen I look in the mirror at my belly, I think that I am fat, that I hate myself, I should be thin and perfect. \nWhen I eat junk food, I think I'm not worthy of it because I'm not slim enough. \nThese thoughts are really destructive and painful. and without the help of a therapist I can't do anything about them. \nAfter I drew this self-portrait, I really feel better. thanks to drawing for this opportunity.",
