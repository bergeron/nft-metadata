    "description": "After watching the explosions on-screen, I imagined all the youth in Ukraine who saw the eruptions in real-life, or next door, as they were just living their life trying to be. This is what motivated me to make this piece.\n\n100% will go to trusted centers that support Ukraine directly. Half will be going to Ukraineâ€™s official Ethereum address. The other Half will go to the trusted Ethereum address of the non-profit, Voices of Children.\n\nI love this piece because the entire art process felt like a flow. Even though 3D can be very technical, this work felt like an inspired painting. This piece was made with purpose and Iâ€™m proud of the art that came out of it.\n\nI want to build relationships with all my collectors. For selected art pieces, I want to pair them with Infinite Objects (looping animated frames) and free framed prints to give a little more real-world value and connection for anyone who collects my art.\n\nSTATS: Render time: 7 Days | 25 fps | 130 Frames\nMUSIC: mixed w/free sounds",
