    "description": "Nirvana is as high and motionless as the summit of a mountain.  It is difficult to reach the top of the mountain.  Nirvana cannot be achieved through desires and desires.  No plant grows on the summit of the mountain, and no desire dwells in Nirvana.  The top of a mountain is free from all fear and anxiety, in Nirvana there is no fear or anxiety.",
