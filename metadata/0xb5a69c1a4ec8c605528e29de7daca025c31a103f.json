    "description": "Classic Hollywood look. Sunny, high contrast, colorful.\n\nI've somehow for nearly as long as I can remember had this connection to Los Angeles. Not sure where it came from, but the sun, the light, the dreams. There is this feeling that I never could verbalise very well, especially with english not being my first language, but I think these photos I made with the wonderful Mia back in 2019. What a powerful personality in this for me important place.\n\nFunny how my LA friends don't really care about West Hollywood, but to me it feels weirdly enough like a bit of home away from home.\n\n---\n\n.: 8000x 5333 .: JPG .: 300DPI .: color .:",
