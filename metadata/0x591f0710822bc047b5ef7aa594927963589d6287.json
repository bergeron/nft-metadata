    "description": "Fall has been progressing in waves and holding out in little pockets this year. Similar elevations will have completely different colors or evolutions, while areas you wouldn't expect to have changed yet have already finished. \n\nThis was shot on a Friday afternoon in late October 2022. I was driving around looking for spots that still held some brighter colors and came across this winding creek just around some bends from Huntington Beach on the shore of Lake Erie. ",
