    "name": "When she takes off the veilâ€¦",
    "description": "She always wears a veil of kindness and affection. The veil represents her soft and delicate heart. Many people have taken pity on her and hurt her. She made her anger, jealousy, and hatred sharp as thorns. The veil she wore was so thin and soft that it easily pierced herself. Her deeply hurt tears had already dried up. Then she decided to throw off the veil of her kindness and affection and rebel. She's got her claws that can cut through anything and her arms that can bounce off anything. \"I won't be kind to anyone anymore. I won't listen to anyone's voices or attacks. I will take revenge on those who have hurt me until now!!!!!!\" I want to be kind to people, I want to love people, and I still have a hesitant expression. I don't know yet if she'll really hurt someone with those claws. But with her weapon, she may have become a little stronger than before.\n\n(Supplement) Accessories with butterfly and bird motifs: Shows her desire to fly somewhere far away.",
