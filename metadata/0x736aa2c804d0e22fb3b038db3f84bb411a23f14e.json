    "name": "Khufu ship",
    "description": "The Khufu ship is an intact full-size solar barque from ancient Egypt. It was sealed into a pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Pharaoh Khufu around 2500 BC, during the Fourth Dynasty of the ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom. Like other buried Ancient Egyptian ships, it was apparently part of the extensive grave goods intended for use in the afterlife. The Khufu ship is one of the oldest, largest and best-preserved vessels from antiquity. It is 43.4 meters (142 ft.) long and 5.9 meters (19 ft.) wide, and has been identified as the world's oldest intact ship and described as \"a masterpiece of woodcraft\" that could sail today if put into a lake or a river.\n\nNote: After completing the purchase process, you have the right to choose some or all of these gifts:\n1- Wooden model from this artwork.\n2- Video documenting the drawing of this artwork \n     from scratch.\n3- Add your nickname or anything you want to this artwork.",
