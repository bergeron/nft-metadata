    "description": "Na’ili’ili-Haele is located in the Haleakala National Park on Maui, Hawaii. The dense bamboo forest is located at the end of an unrecognized trail consisting of slippery make shift planks, waist deep water crossings, rickety ladders and climbing giant walls of wet stone. The feeling of being lost in this bamboo forest is well worth the efforts.\n",
