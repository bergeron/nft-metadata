    "description": "The iconic Jet d'Eau is a large fountain in Geneva, Switzerland and is one of the city's most famous landmarks. Situated where Lake Geneva exits as the Rh√¥ne, it is visible throughout the city and from the air, even when flying over Geneva at an altitude of ten kilometres. It measures 140 meters high.\n\nI captured this image of this global icon a few years ago. It remains one of my most beautiful images ever. The composition of the image with the sunset, the plane in the sky and a single person alone at the foot of the fountain aligned with it, makes this image special. \n\nTo make this unique piece even more unique, the first owner of it can ask to receive a free and signed print of their acquisition, directly to their home.\n\nEdition : 1/1",
