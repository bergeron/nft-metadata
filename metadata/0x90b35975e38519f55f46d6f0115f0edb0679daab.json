    "description": "Digital file of the augmented reality version of my Adlocutio (Sean Ford) bronze sculpture. Exhibited in London at James Freeman Gallery from 10 February to 5 March 2022 in lieu of the bronze work due to COVID-19 lockdown delays. Created by 3D scanning model and porn actor Sean Ford.\n\nIn ancient Rome the Latin word adlocutio means an address given by a general, usually the emperor, to his massed army and legions, and a general form of Roman salute from the army to their leader. The adlocutio is one of the most widely represented formulas of Roman art and is usually denoted by the outstretched right hand of the figure, signalling power and authority, divinity and devotion.",
