    "description": "â€˜The Walk' is the first part of my genesis Foundation NFT collection.\n\nThis was shot back in 2017 at Kelingking Beach Bali.\n\nThe route to this spot was quite challenging. My Wife and I were quite scared to be honest. \n\nIt holds a special place in my heart because this is my first photo that got featured in traditional magazine (COLOURS).\n",
