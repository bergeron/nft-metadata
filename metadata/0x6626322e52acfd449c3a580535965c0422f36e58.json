    "description": "The 100 NFTs are still images from Fuga delle Sirene video- a combination of digital animation and sound collage. The video is part of the Siren Symphony in G sharp solo exhibition which takes place between October 6-29 at Kappatos Gallery in Athens, Greece. The theme of the video is inspired by the mythical bird-like Siren creatures in the Odyssey which Pavlina has been researching the past two years. In her works, she intentionally omits the female element - gender of the Sirens and emphasizes their avian nature. The bird is an ancient symbol of transcendence, the soul, a spirit of the dead with an ability to communicate with gods or enter into a higher state of consciousness, thought, knowledge and imagination. A cage of birds represents the mind, according to Plato’s Theaetetus. In the Odyssey, the Siren-bird represents the entrapment of the mind. A metaphorical transfixion where our ego is endlessly recycled. ",
