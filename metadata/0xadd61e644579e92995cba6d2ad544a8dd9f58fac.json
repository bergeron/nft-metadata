    "description": "Free, tranquil, peacefulâ€¦all words to easily describe this paradise in the Canadian Rockies.\n\nI felt overwhelmed when I reached the plateau, pushing myself physically and mentally to get here. Surrounded by golden larches and snowy peaks, I felt a wave of peace wash over me. Never underestimate what a moment of quiet reflection in the mountains can do to help find some perspective. ",
