    "description": "The “Plasti-berg Penguin”  focuses on the ocean and our various waterways that are ridden with plastic waste, both macro and micro in size. We all know that it is natural for Penguins to stand on icebergs, but it should not become the norm to see them wading the waters via a bottle. \n\nThrough the use of art and common imagery this piece is created to evoke thoughts on our current path as a civilization; are we leading ourselves to the point of no return? Ask yourself this, is the world’s current infatuation with plastic that much more important than a world that will someday be consumed within it?",
