    "description": "I would Rather Be where you are.\n\nThis song is special to me because it was inspired by my best friend. A friendship that has endured disagreements, tears, love and love lost, long distance, parenthood oh and a global pandemic.\n\nThe past few years has been a difficult and isolating time for so many. Being separated from the ones we love has been one of the hardest parts of this experience. \"Rather Be\" is a tribute to that feeling of longing and the deep connection that exists between close friends and family. \n\nThe song was produced by THE N.E.W.S. w/ addtl. production from Splash Gordon, myself and B. Sharpe\nwritten By myself and my writing partners Splash Gordon, and Lauran Marie\nI flew to visit my family where I recorded this with my brother B. Sharpe\n\nthe final piece of the puzzle, the outro of the song, includes audio of memories I captured @ Miami Art Basel with some new found Web3 family \nJune Jissle\nSolèy\nQueen Charm Taylor\nand \nCam Murdoch\n\nI hope that this song will provide some comfort to anyone else who is missing their loved ones during this time. \n\nThank you for listening ",
