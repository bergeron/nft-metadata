    "description": "“The origin of human thought is over debated and rumored to be a whisper from a foreign realm, but whispers tend to get lost in the noise of the screaming universe.” — Pink Nihilsm by Supamalaman\n\nMost people would agree that for every beginning there is an end, but how then, do I explain the thoughts that linger infinitely along the edges of the boat that is my mind when I so often find myself lost at sea? A place where, if looking forward, the sky meets an ocean and at some point you can no longer tell the difference between the two. \n\nTime & time again we mistake the edge for the end when it is yet another beginning. \n\nA wise man once told me that there are simply more days in our lifetime than there is fortune to receive and I now understand that there are also more beginnings than there are endings and for this reason, I see fortune as more than mere luck; It is like Nature or like Love.. A redeeming force.\n\n(A direct PDF link of Pink Nihilism will be included for the collector)",
