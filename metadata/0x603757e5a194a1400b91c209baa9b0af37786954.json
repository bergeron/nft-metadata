    "description": "Created from 2013 to 2021, these images are part of a photo series called Crash Landed.\n\n⁠The series depicts an astronaut returning to Earth, which has been destroyed and abandoned by humans. While the images are surreal and cinematic, they also evoke a very human feeling of isolation - a feeling we all are very familiar with after Covid-19.⁠\n\nEdition 1/1 by Ken Hermann",
