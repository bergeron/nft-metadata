    "description": "As a Mexican photographer, I have always been mesmerized by the Day of the Dead. Its significance is captivating, the festivities can be seen in folklore, colors, dance and family, highlighting a certain irony in its celebration of death. \nThis tradition honors our loved ones who have passed away, and are connected to the physical world by the means of memory, exemplified by the typical offerings left for the dead, which use food, flowers and wine to connect with the deceased. \n\nThe moments I captured in this collection of images are meant to communicate the beautiful and natural ways in which we can connect with death, especially in its approach as something to exploit in life, art and culture.
