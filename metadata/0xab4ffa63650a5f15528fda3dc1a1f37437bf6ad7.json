    "description": "Taking pictures at night is not easy. You can't just grab the camera and go. At night it is even more important to read and see light correctly, otherwise even the best camera won't help you. In winter it is best when it gets dark early but people are still at work. The illuminated windows create patterns that make each image unique. A wild mix of skill, luck and the right timing.",
