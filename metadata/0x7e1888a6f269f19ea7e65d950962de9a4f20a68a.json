    "description": "Am I myself? \n\nYes. I have removed the veils. \n\nI went on my way to search for my soul with courage and absolute nakedness. \n\nToday, I can convey whatever I look at, into that which I desire in my thoughts. \n\nLight rays penetrate in my heart and enlighten my vision. I can see into eternity and I can hear the twinkling of the stars.\n\nBig thanks for amazing music to @SafiSafavi (#Musician Violinist & Composer | Conductor of the Berkeh Orchestra)",
