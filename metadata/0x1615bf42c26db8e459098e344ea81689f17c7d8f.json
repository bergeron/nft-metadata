    "description": "This song is a reflection on maintaining your serenity amidst all the bullshit in this world. The ability to see through the illusions of life and see the truth of infinite abundance and light that exists on the other side.\n\nAyotemi and Sebastian represent two completely different cultures and backgrounds and the manifestation of their collaboration, \"Serene\" represents a shared view on the importance of finding serenity and abundance in a world that can often feel chaotic and overwhelming. They both knew firsthand what it was like to come from humble beginnings and to work tirelessly to achieve success, but they also recognized the importance of taking time to appreciate the beauty and blessings in life.",
