    "description": "This series was birthed from the multidimensional creative practices of Natalie Goldstein and Courtney Kinnare. Through a shoot that was conceptualized and brought to life in the late hours of the night, we stayed up fueled by inspiration and creating a vision that exceeded reality. \n\n'Etherealm' explores surrealism through the lens of the female figure. Shot on film & digital, the final images bring a soft and dreamy gaze to the juxtaposition of alien form and human beauty. The series focuses on shape and movement rather than the objectification of the female body.  Contrasting metal elements, innocent expressions, and empowered poses, each image brings the viewer to an ethereal, otherworldly place rooted in the physical realm.\n\n2400x3000px jpg shot on digital\n\nMakeup:  Natalie Kaplan\nHair: Brooke Tokar",
