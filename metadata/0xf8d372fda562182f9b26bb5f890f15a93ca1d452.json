    "description": "This artwork was created for the exhibition \"I am...\" powered by Gxrls Revolution and Jean-Michel Pailhon.\n\n‘Ephemera’ is part of a series of digital illustrations that utilize a technique inspired by Japanese woodblock printmaking. The collection draws its main inspiration from the contemplation of death in Buddhist practice and the idea of accepting oneself. The artwork features a girl whose skin is peeling away, revealing the red flesh beneath, as a visual representation of the transience of our physical bodies.\n\nAs an artist, I am fascinated by Asian philosophy and the contemplation of death, and I wanted to create a collection that captures the beauty and fragility of life. The technique I use in these digital illustrations is reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodblock prints, but adapted for the digital medium. The result is a unique and modern interpretation that pays homage to the traditional technique while pushing the boundaries of digital art.",
