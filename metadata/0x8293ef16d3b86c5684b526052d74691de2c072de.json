    "description": "Mixed-media, 2022. \n\nIn this particular collaboration, the artists explore the concept of hypertemporality, where what should be fleeting like a whiff of perfume, is now permanently encoded on the blockchain. \n\nThe subject of the photograph by @JULIENLRVR, exudes the effortless naturalness of a woman who casually poses for the camera, moments before she goes to bed to rest. \n\nThe colorful overlay of @vantoetsenbord, upends this casual scene, by emphasising that this image is in fact artificially constructed, and that the picture is not as casual as one might think. \n\nThe work could therefore be regarded as 21st century impressionism, using the recognizable visual style to draw attention to the beauty of fleeting moments, while encapsulating its perpetuity in a smart contract.\n",
