    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them with you. All of them. This year we’re going to release 24 songs in 48 weeks, in web3 and beyond, starting this week on Sound. We want to build this album in public, and bring our holders into the creative conversation as we go.\n\nIf we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music. WATCH THIS SPACE.\n\n“Let’s Play House” is the 1st of these 24 singles. PM through and through. And we’re excited to launch this project on Sound XYZ today with our genesis mint, limited to 24 editions at .01 ETH. Jump in and build with us. Single two will be out 2 weeks from today, and single three 2 weeks after that. More on that later.  \n\n“Let’s Play House” is our debut mint, the genesis key, the access pass for everything else we’re planning in this space. We made the song in Milan last summer. Our first time in Italy, just two kids running through the streets of Milan stumbling into any place that played house music. When we got back to our hotel room, it was clear what we needed to do. That night on the balcony, “Let’s Play House” was born. \n\nWe feel like it could be the start of something special, a grand experiment we can’t wait to bring into the world, and we’d love for you to jump in and build with us.",
