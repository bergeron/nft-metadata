    "description": "\"Mirror of Frailty\" is a thought-provoking and visually striking piece that delves into the complexities of the human psyche.\n\nThe artwork showcases the duality of human emotions and the fragility of the human mind. The painting features two identical faces, each with a distinct expression - one face is depicted as calm and serene, while the other is contorted in an expression of distress. The contrasting expressions are meant to symbolize the internal conflict and struggle that can exist within a single person.",
