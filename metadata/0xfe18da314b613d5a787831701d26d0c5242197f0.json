    "description": "This year I am going be exploring the medium of video a lot more. I finally have the capabilities and high-quality equipment to be able to make interesting and cinematic videos. I'm currently waiting on a gimbal to arrive which is when I'm really going to start having fun with making these clips.\n\nMinting this particular piece cements my plan to focus a lot on video this year, of course, I won't be stopping photography!\n\nAll I need is for Korea to get warmer and I'll be back outside, this week we recorded a real-feel temperature of -29, so I think I need to wait a few more weeks yet. \n\nAnyways, enjoy my first-ever video mint, I had a lot of fun making, editing and compiling these short clips together, and I look forward to making more.",
