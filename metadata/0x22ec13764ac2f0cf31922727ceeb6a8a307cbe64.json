    "description": "The egg membrane cracks and the inside of the egg pops out at the moment you chew ikura. It feels a little oily.\n\nYou may feel richness of the ikura, but the taste is actually light and simple. So, it will be much more delicious if itâ€™s marinated in soy sauce-based sauce. The marinate sauce takes away the bad smell of ikura, and you can directly feel the umami of them!",
