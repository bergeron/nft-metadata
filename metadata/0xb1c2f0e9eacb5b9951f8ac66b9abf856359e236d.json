As each individual moves from place to place, one person stands out from the crowd and in a brief moment is motionless in a sea of people. Her story is different from the rest but through all of her uniqueness, she shares the same commonalities of joys and struggles in daily life and the ever constant battle with time.\n\nBilly Dinh.
