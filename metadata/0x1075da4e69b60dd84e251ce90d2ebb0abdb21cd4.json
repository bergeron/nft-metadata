    "description": "Elena guiding Silas, both in a physical way through the jungle to search for the \"magic beans,\" but also guiding him emotionally through life.\n\nAmarylis is a 34 years old artist and illustrator from Luxembourg and Belgium. While she creates in 2D digital and animated illustrations, she also enjoys working traditionally with paint on canvases. Femininity plays a huge role in her work and she hopes her art transmits feelings of power, strength, and confidence in all who see it."
