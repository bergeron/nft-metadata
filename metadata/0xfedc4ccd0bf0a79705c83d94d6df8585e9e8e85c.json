    "description": "Set in the Mojave Desert, Linear Determinatives is meant to invoke the optimism of greenery growing in a desert and the interconnectedness of life on Earth. This series is about ancestral connections to land and being good ancestors to future generations. These future petroglyphs carry an encoded history of indigenous knowledge into the metaverse. \n\tThis petroglyph was generated using my Woodland style GAN trained on hundreds of Woodland School drawings. What will this petroglyph be to future generations? A map? territory marker? Used to identify trade routes? Will it be used to tell ancestral stories? Only time will tellâ€¦\n\tThis petroglyph was made for the Transform Exhibit LA in November 2021 with the common theme of RECONCILIATION. This word represents a journey towards equal representation and respect. Indigenous people will be included in the future.\n",
