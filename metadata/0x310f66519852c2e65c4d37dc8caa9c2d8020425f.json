    "description": "Based on the fiction Joseph Beuys would retell about his WW2 plane crash that reverberated through his artistic practice to become his self generated myth.\n\nThe text sourced from a mix of Wikipedia, chat GPT and DEEPLtranslator.\n\nThe aesthetic is a communication with Beuys' black board series of works where he would sketch diagrams in performances often related to  ideas of social progress.\n\nThe core driver in this work was the dichotomy between how Beuys wanted to present his new identity based on a fiction with his very real recent history. \n\nThe idea of the birth of the artist moving from a self propelled fiction into a physical state.",
