    "description": "Have you ever wondered why wreaths are mostly related to women?\n\nTheir meaning is extensive and depends a lot on the time and place. But in general, they are a symbol of fertility, beauty, purity... but... can't a man be all that too? \n\nThere was a time when it symbolized struggle, union, peace... (and a lot of drugs hahaha)\n\nI wanted to unite it, we want union and peace. To stop fighting for what should be normal. \nWe want freedom.\nAnd although beauty is very relative to those who observe it, there is too much of it to go unnoticed. \n\n",
