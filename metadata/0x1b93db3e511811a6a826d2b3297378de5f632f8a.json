    "description": "This is the first 1/1 piece in this collection out of 6.\n\nI named this piece NUNKI; which is after a young inter-galactic star normally overlooked by the world. \n\nThis piece symbolises selflessness, strength, and beauty. \n\nIn correlation to its name, it is to symbolise that out of the trillions of stars out there, regardless of the size, popularity or reputation; just like Nunki, when singled out, it's beauty, artistry, and skills speak for itself.\n\nDelving deep into this artwork to view how individual detailed mosaic element on the canvas came together to create this piece is nothing short of mesmerising.\n\nThank you,\nTov.\n\n\nDETAILS\nArtwork Size: 2128 x 3200\n\nAccess to: 8500 x 12800 \n[read collection description about this option]\n\nMy official website: https://6ex.co/\n\n\n",
