    "description": "While connecting dots, i menifested a unique line art and another piece in my collection,\nIt looks like a man holding a stereo, a fish and couple of waves and bubbles but what it actually is....... is alot lines drawn carefully with patience and it's resembles the reality of life, each drag of line is time and whole painting is menifestation of life\n\nIt’s dark, the forest is playing trance, and as you walk with your coffee you step underwater in the dreamy fish’s den, who speaks in waves!\n",
