    "description": "Mystique is one of the most popular and interesting characters in the universe.  She has the ability to shapeshift. This gives her both a powerful defense mechanism and the ability to use it effectively in the criminal world. Mystique appears in a world in the future, during a period of intense mutant-human conflict. She is a mutant by birth and therefore must live a life separated from humans. However, thanks to her shape-shifting ability, she can hide this separation and move easily between humans. She also has a dark past, which adds to her uniqueness. His shapeshifting ability is not only for defense and offense, but also affects the character's personality and storyline.",
