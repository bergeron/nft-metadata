    "description": "this is the last art piece i ever made in my twenties. finished at 11:59 on my 30th birthday. this is a poetry piece that i have performed at every show ive done in the last 5 years... if you have seen me perform, you've seen this piece live in one way, shape or another. \n\nIt is everything to me. It described my last decade of life. the struggle. the love. the support. the pain. the fight. its all here, in silence.  ",
