    "description": "She is Laylah, which means night-born. \nHer skin is white as the moon, for she hardly sees the sunlight. Her day begins when the sun goes down, and it is then that she walks the cold, damp moors that surround her hometown. She barely crosses paths with anyone, but every now and then, when someone sees her, a shiver runs through their body. Her beauty is strangely overwhelming, cold as the night but magical as the stars.\n",
