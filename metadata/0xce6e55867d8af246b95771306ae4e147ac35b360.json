    "description": "Qadr in Turkish (Kadir) calligraphy with arabic lettering style.\n\nLaylat al-Qadr (Arabic: لیلة القدر‎), (Turkish: Kadir Gecesi) variously rendered in English as the Night of Decree, Night of Power, Night of Value, Night of Destiny, or Night of Measures, is, in Islamic belief, the night when the Quran was first sent down from Heaven to the world and also the night when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the prophet Muhammad. According to many Muslim sources, it was one of the odd-numbered nights of the last ten days of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Since that time, Muslims have regarded the last ten nights of Ramadan as being especially blessed. Muslims believe that the Night of Qadr comes with blessings and mercy of God in abundance, sins are forgiven, supplications are accepted, and that the annual decree is revealed to the angels who carry it out according to Allah's Grace.\n\nMore Information:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadr_Night",
