    "description": "The Toronto Raptors continually were dismissed as a team with no chances in the NBA playoffs in 2019.\n\nBut in a magical run, capped off by an epic championship title Toronto showed the world what they were built of.\n\nTaken the night they clinched the NBA Championship, the streets were full of jubilant fans celebrating the biggest win the city had seen in my lifetime.",
