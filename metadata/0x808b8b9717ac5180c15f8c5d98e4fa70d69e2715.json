    "description": " There was a door that no one would tell what lies behind it\na door in a house with twelve black-clothed sad old men.\nThe young servant was wondering what is it about this door that makes it forbidden.\n Then one night he opens the door to figure out what's behind it. \nthe door was opened as if opened to heaven, he was faced with a palace, several maids who welcomed him.\nThey accompanied him to the queen. The young man married the queen and everything seemed to be good but yet there was another door in the palace. \"that room is been restricted by the queen's order\" the young maid said.\n he answered arrogantly:  the last time I passed a forbidden door I ended up here.\n He opened that door and fell in the ex location among that black-clothed old men, the door was locked behind him and never been opened and he was sad as the rest of them",
