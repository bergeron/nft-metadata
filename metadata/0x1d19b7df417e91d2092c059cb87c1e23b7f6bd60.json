    "description": "\"Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and makes him its instrument. The artist is not a person endowed with free will who seeks his own ends, but one who allows art to realize its purpose through him. As a human being he may have moods and a will and personal aims, but as an artist he is \"man\" in a higher sense— he is \"collective man\"— one who carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic forms of mankind.\"  \n-Carl Jung\n\ndigital painting by schoolsstillout  \ncreated 2022  \n6000px x 6000px",
