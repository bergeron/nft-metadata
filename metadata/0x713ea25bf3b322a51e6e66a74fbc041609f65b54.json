    "description": "The world can seem really dark some days. In the midst of the darkness and ‚Äúvoid‚Äù at the creation of the world, God said, ‚ÄúLet there be light.‚Äù In your own mind-darkened, will-paralyzed, conscience-dulled soul, God can make the light penetrate and turn the darkness of your own life into day, if you will let Him. Many of you are living in spiritual darkness, confused, frustrated, disturbed, and fearful. Let the Light come into your heart by faith and give you peace.\n\nPsalm 18:28 You, Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light.\n\nPrayer: I praise You, Lord Jesus, for Your light which shines through the dimness of my soul. I pray that Your light will shine in people reading this so that they may be filled with Your peace and comfort no matter what the circumstances.\n\n30% of proceeds will go towards charity  \nBased from original painting by Bonnie  \nPhysical painting is also available for purchase  \nThank you for your support üñ§\n\nSee https://linktr.ee/brooksgallery for more collections and creations of my NFT journey.",
