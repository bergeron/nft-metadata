Unfortunately, the MoonCat Genesis 12 Space Mission, led by the late-Captain Cheshire’s daughter, Helena Cheshire II, was intercepted by SunRat rivals en route to the Red Planet (aka “Mars”). We have not yet heard back from the captain, but did receive the following transmission, ostensibly from enemy quarters:  'Cheshire is safe – for now. We demand that you hand over the Marfa basecamp as well as retreat from your “Mars” mission – that land is ours. If you do not comply, Captain Cheshire will be dead within 24 hours.' The MoonCat Leader, her Supreme Majesty Alba the White, alongside her co-ruler, his Supreme Majesty Nadir the Black, are negotiating with the SunRats and hope to have Captain Cheshire and her crew returned to safety soon."
