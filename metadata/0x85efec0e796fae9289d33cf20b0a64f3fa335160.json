    "description": "\"Memes Outside\" examines the gap between our current online communities and the offline world.  It invites us to consider the history of offline art, cultural transgression and graffiti, blockchain technology and the ubiquity of our mobile phones.\n\n\"Memes Outside\" was inspired by Kenneth Josephson's \"New York, 1970\" and Alex Bartsch's \"Covers\"\n\nImage: single digital photo with post-production: brightness, contrast, cropping, minor distortion to better fit the 2:3 ratio\n\nRights: CC BY-SA"
