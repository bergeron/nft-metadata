    "description": "The starship \"Intrepid\" was on a mission unlike any other it had undertaken before. Captain Mikasa and her crew were tasked with traversing a nebula that had never been explored by humans. As they soared through the clouds of gas and dust, the crew marveled at the vibrant colors that surrounded them. Deep blues, purples, and pinks swirled around them, creating a mesmerizing and otherworldly scene.",
