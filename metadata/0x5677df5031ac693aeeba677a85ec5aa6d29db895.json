I wanted to pick a photo that really spoke to me on a personal level and represents who i am as an Artist / Photographer. \nThis photo reflects a changing world coming out of a global pandemic and the civil rights movement of 2020-2021. \nStreet Photography and street portraits are one of my most passionate things to shoot. This mint is the first time i have shared this photo with the world. I hope you enjoy.  ",
