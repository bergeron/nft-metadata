    "description": "In this episode of The Dankness, we dive into the world of C3, an artist who continues to push boundaries and risks it all to give a voice to the voiceless. Despite the strict anti-regime and crypto bans in Iran, C3's work has found its way into the hands of loyal collectors worldwide.  The Iranian-born enigmatic artist defies danger to share his powerful message through art and NFTs. We explore his journey from a regular job to becoming a successful full-time NFT artist, and the darkness and hardships he faced along the way.\n\nJoin us as we discuss C3's discovery of NFTs, his commitment to sharing the true stories behind his art, and the high stakes he faces in Iran for producing his work. Learn about the importance of building a cohesive body of work and how C3's kindness and empathy have shaped his experiences in the NFT space. Listen in as he shares valuable advice for new artists entering the world of NFTs and how forming genuine connections with like-minded individuals can make all the difference. You can learn more about C3 and his work at his website (c3naa.art) and be sure to follow him on Twitter @c3naaX.\n\nTo keep up with the podcast follow @thedanknessxyz on Twitter.
