    "description": "Get Back Up is supposed to feel like a like a letter to my close friends and family. Music has always been an outlet where I have been able to a show a more vulnerable side of myself and talk about things I normally wouldn't share. Essentially what I'm saying in this song  is even though sometimes life can be hard, and I may feel defeated, I know that there's light at the end of the tunnel. My hope is that whoever hear's this song is able to apply it to their own personal situation and find the strength to keep pushing forward.  ",
