    "description": "I made this piece during an art party in the Mojoheads discord. We were given 6 themes every 10 minutes as we drew. The themes, in order, were: feelings, green, patterns, window, nature, future. \n\nThis piece represents a creative awakening for me as an artist. It's the first time I am sharing a piece of my work on the blockchain that does not include a dog. Through the creative tools I've developed for myself and aim to share with others, I often end up with pieces that stretch beyond the uniformity in my main project, WorkingDogs. Now I have a place to share these pieces with others. Thank you!",
