    "description": "Traveling across the United States, we woke up early to catch the sunrise at the White Sands National Park in New Mexico. We got there just in time but were told we couldn't enter the park until the military was finished with their experiments. I guess they test bombs out there. A few hours later, much past sunrise, we were allowed to enter and roam for hours in the sun sipping pastel lattes.",
