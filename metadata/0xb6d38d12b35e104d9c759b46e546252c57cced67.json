    "description": "A visualization of buoyant spheres moving in air currents and music waves. The spheres are made of a hyper-light nano-material impermeable to helium. The spheres would be the first permanently air buoyant objects. By mixing ratios of air and helium, the spheres may be calibrated to hover at specific altitudes.\n\nFloating Ballroom was conceived by artist Tom Shannon. Shannon is famous for creating the first large-scale permanently levitated sculptures. These remain the largest permanent-magnet levitated objects in the world.\nHe has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Centre Pompidou. He designed the TED prize, the Buckminster Fuller Prize, the Pritzker Prize for the Michael J. Fox foundation, and the Trophy Jules Verne.\nAnimation by [Jonah Tobias](https://foundation.app/@VOXIL) with an original score by [Musician John Sieger] ((https://johnsieger.com/).\n\nAn HD version of the animation will be made available to the buyer on request.",
