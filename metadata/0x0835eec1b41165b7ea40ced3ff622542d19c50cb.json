    "description": "“I’m Like That” was written by multi-platinum producer CJ Baran (Melanie Martinez, Panic at the Disco, Carly Rae Jepsen) Catherine Grace Garner aka SLAYYYTER and Marikah Baran (Voice of CUDDLES)\nThe song began as an orphan demo CJ and Catherine made in 2019. Once CJ and Marikah created CUDDLES with CG Artist Nicolas Brunet, they knew with some re-writing, it could be the perfect track for this mall goth stuffed animal cat with abandonment issues. The main elements of the track are the chopped and screwed Gregorian choir sample, the SH-2 synth bass and an 808 kit with some hair metal inspired guitars in the post chorus’. Dark fairytale gone hip hop at the rock show. \n",
