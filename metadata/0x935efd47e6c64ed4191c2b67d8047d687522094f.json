    "description": "“Pure Heart Of Gold”\n\n“All that we send into the lives of others comes back into our own” - Edwin Markham, American Poet.\n\nIn one of Shakespeare's play’s ‘Henry V’, while in disguise, the titular character spends time amongst the commoners prior to the Battle of Agincourt in order to determine the level of morale. \n\nWhen one of the soldiers was asked what he thought of the king he replied, ““The king’s a bawcock, and a heart of gold, a lad of life, an imp of fame …” (Act 4, Scene 1), which would suggest that he admires the king.\n\nSo, may whoever holds this NFT be granted abundant returns of efforts put forth so far in the ecosystem, and for it be a certificate of authenticity of your ‘Pure Heart Of Gold’ that sets you apart as a leader in WEB3. We are all Human and perfection is impossible. Acting with intentions spawned from a pure heart is not; and a heart of gold is worth more than its own weight.\n\nCreated & Minted by: Bodhizai, 2023.  \n10240 x 10240 px - 300 dpi - Ai/Photoshop/Topaz  \nTwitter: @Bodhizai  \nIG: @Bodhizai  \nwww.bodhizai.com\n\n",
