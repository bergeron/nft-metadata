    "description": "The Tercom eclipse as seen from the surface of the planet Gineeren. The Tercom Eclipse signaled the approaching days of the Strudentoics Prophecy, and mark the beginning of the Gineeren Chronicles, moments before the prologue of our story begins.\n\nBehind the Tercom moon, the 2 suns were beginning to merge as one. A long awaited event by the inhabitants of Gineerens smallest moon, now desperately fleeing from thier homes as the moons surface destabilizes, and begins to fall apart.\n\nUnable to send aid in evacuating the small moon, the Tracties observe both events from the Ompu observatory, while thier leader awaits the birth of his only child. Unaware that not only 1, but 3 will come into being, as the 2 suns become one, and the small moon comes crashing down into the far side of his planet.\n\nAll the Toraudite of Water can do is watch in horror as all his company ships pour off the broken moon, yet only 1 small ship is able to escape before all life upon the moon is lost.",
