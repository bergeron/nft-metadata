    "description": "“Tell Me Where To Go” is a funky, feel-good summer anthem. The video takes place in a home reminiscent of the 70s, accompanied by outfits and hairstyles to match. Creatively directed by the group itself, the video came to life after stumbling across a perfectly styled AirBnb that was coincidentally the first search result. ",
