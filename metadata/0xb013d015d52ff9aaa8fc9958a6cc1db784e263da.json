    "description": "In this Digital Sculpture Series \n“Beyond the Matrix” Gregory Borlein \nexplores with 3D Scanned everyday \nenvironments and a uniquely made \nsoundtrack for each of them the \nFragments of reality we percieve \nand what lies beyond it. \n\nWe see scenes that we walk through \nourselves but with a new 360 degree \nperspective and a soundtrack that \nmakes us ponder what reality actually \nis and which meaning we give to it. \n\nSometimes a different soundtrack to \na similar scene makes a complete \ndifference in how we percieve it.\n\nThe glitches that appear in the \nsculptures due to technological \nissues are welcomed, because they \nshow the non fixed state of things \nand also the black background that \nsurrounds them and the black spots \nthat are appearing and disappearing.\n\nWhile the digital sculptures are \nasking us what lies behind that which \nwe can see and what it is \nthat gives reality as we know it, \nthe space to appear in as.\n\n\nGregory Borlein studied painting, \ndigital arts and sculpture at the \nAcademy of fine arts Munich and Lisbon",
