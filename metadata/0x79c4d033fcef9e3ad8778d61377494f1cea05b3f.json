    "description": "“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” That is the power of manifestation.\n~ Paulo Coelho\n\nManifestation techniques are based on the law of attraction of New Thought spirituality. The process involves positive thinking, or even directing requests to \"the universe\", It’s your conscious effort to trust that the Universe will provide you with exactly what you need at the time you need it. Achieving your dreams is possible — first, you have to believe. ",
