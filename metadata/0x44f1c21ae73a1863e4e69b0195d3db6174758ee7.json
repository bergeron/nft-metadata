    "name": "Appendix",
    "description": "One of the most famous rudiments is the appendix. It was required for the digestion of heavy plant foods. In animals, as experts note, this organ is well developed and quite large in size. Modern man no longer needs it, because he no longer eats plants in such quantities as our ancestors a thousand years ago. Today, the appendix is more of a potential threat to human health. With inflammation of the process, a person often gets on the operating table. If you delay the time, you can lead to a rupture of the organ and extremely unpleasant consequences.",
