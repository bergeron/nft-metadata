    "description": "The car was about to move when I heard a voice. I looked out. Although it was dark, I could see vague shadows of people along the road coming cheerfully to welcome someone. I flashed to see whatâ€™s going on. I saw them clearly just for a moment and they saw only the flash light. The camera had only a moment to uncover their faces. After several flashing, they attracted to the light more than the one to be greeted. It seemed the flash light caused them to be seen.",
