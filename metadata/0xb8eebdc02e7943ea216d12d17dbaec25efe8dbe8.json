    "description": "Itâ€™s a story about a kid with a few toys. Many of those are broken, like this toy car that was transformed into a futuristic flying vehicle using old batteries, rubber bands and a pinch of imagination. \nExcited child imagines this car flying through an imaginary city, each time the plot is different, keeping the kid interested. \nSitting alone in his room, looking at his creation he makes a very first decision to capture this moment, save into his memory like a mental screenshot that he can revisit years later. \nAnd it works, 20+ years later he still remembers that wonderful moment that warms his heart.",
