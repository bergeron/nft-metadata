    "description": "I think there is something particularly creepy about Joe, those gnarly teeth are a testament to that. Look at those big staring, expressionless and almost crossed-eyed eyes. They give you a sense of lunacy as if Joe is completely unhinged from reality. Joe isn't the sharpest tool in the shed either and the big squooshy ears leaves me thinking there isn't much going on between them.\n\nThe base layer is an image of Joe Biden speaking at the 2020 Iowa State Education Association (ISEA) Legislative Conference.
