    "description": "The Squad Membership DVD is step one in getting you set up as a participant in the Squad ecosystem. Your Membership DVD will be the key to how you connect to and derive value from The Squad. You can think of it as an all-access pass to everything Squad. We highly recommend you hold onto your Membership DVD tight! A lot in the pipeline for you!\n\nThe Squad Member Pass is an extract from artist Cody Bayne:\n “Rome is Burning” (2015) comes from an ongoing series established in 2013 entitled ‘Disparate Renewal’. First shown during my solo show, “NONEXTANT” at Gold Haus Gallery in Highland Park, it went on to be curated into a collection on Saatchi Art by Rebecca Wilson & featured on the television show “Listing Impossible”. Created by combining materials collected on the streets & walls of Rome, Italy and Los Angeles then overlaid with the abstracted gestures of the visual vernacular specific to Disparate Renewal series. The title is a reference to ‘Nero fiddles while Rome burns” which carries layered meaning and allows viewer to interpret the work through their personal lens. It is fitting that the work now plays a role in Film3 history as part of the historic NFT drop by The Squad who are building a vision for the future of film whilst the old guards fiddle. - Cody Bayne",
