    "description": "Is it Tuesday? \nWhen will it be Tuesday? \nI’m permitted happiness on Tuesday. \nI’ll extinguish my soul until the hour hand strikes that lovely 24-hour cove of time one day después Monday! \nWhen will it be Tuesday?\nIs it Tuesday?\n\nCollaborative Jolt Of Expression (CJOE) are unique 1/1 versions of a GJOE as imagined by Custom Horror.\n\nI’m beyond humbled to be included in this collection, sharing space with world-class artists.\n\n‘Waiting’ is a digital art created via collage and sketch work and Photoshop editing. The frenetic, graffiti tag-influenced motif asks the viewer about their present day life. More importantly, for both the viewer and looking glass creator, the idiosyncratic canvas urges — don’t wait to chase after your dream life.\n \nTuesday isn’t coming.\n\nMake it happen.\n\nOne. ",
