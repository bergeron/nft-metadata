    "description": "Welcome to Mirer. A place where all you want is mirrored back to you. Reflected dreams float in the sky, easily colliding and shattering. The ground is covered with jagged shards, bright boulders and fine, metallic dust.  If you go there, know what you truly want. But do not stay. Being idle while dreaming is dangerous.",
