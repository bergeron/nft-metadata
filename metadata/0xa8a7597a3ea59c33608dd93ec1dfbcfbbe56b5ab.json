    "description": "Imagine lying on the grass on a warm sunny day and taking a nap. \nYou close your eyes but you still see the sunlight through your eyelids. Hypnotising textures, colors and shapes appear in front of your eyes... \n\nIn the next moment, you feel like falling... Falling deep into yourself, into unexplored parts of your soul that are hidden from you when youâ€™re awake.\n\nI captured this unexplainable state of mind, a short moment before falling asleep, when you close your eyes and disconnect from the outside reality.",
