    "description": "Her power is all seeing and timeless. Sister of Tlazolteotl the ‘Filth Deity’ – purifier of men’s sins and goddess of childbirth. Cousin of Eileithyia the pre-Hellenic goddess of childbirth, who hindered or helped depending upon her mood. Yet, one of a kind. Her life began as an antiquated assemblage birthed into the virtual realms via the use of 3D scanning and animation – then raised within the Celestial Bodies series. In astrological terms a celestial body is a single, tightly bound, contiguous entity. These silent floating entities each pertain to their own characteristics whilst talking of human relations, fetishism and otherness.",
