    "description": "In hues of blue and shades of green,\nA canvas lay, a world unseen.\nA beauty lost, a stroke misplaced,\nAn abstraction that time erased.\n\nAmidst the curves and gentle lines,\nLies a tale of forgotten designs.\nOf art and grace, a feminine touch,\nA masterpiece that we loved so much.\n\nBut time, it took its toll,\nAs colors faded and lines unrolled.\nThe abstraction, it lost its way,\nA beauty lost, a world in disarray.\n\nYet, in the stillness of the night,\nYou can hear its faint whispers and its light.\nThe colors, they still dance and play,\nA lost abstraction, but not gone away.\n\nFor in our hearts, it still lives on,\nA piece of art that will never be gone.\nA feminine touch, a masterpiece so rare,\nA lost abstraction, forever held dear.",
