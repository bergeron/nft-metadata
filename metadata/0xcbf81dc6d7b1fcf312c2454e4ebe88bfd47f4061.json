    "description": "This piece was created based on personal psychedelic experiences.  \nThe hands represent creation while the eyes represent presence and consciousness. \nThese images are abundant in my visuals and have become a huge integrated part of my artwork style. The eyes crying cosmic tears, because the beauty of the ineffable truth is too much to bear for human eyes, and the emotions felt build up and the tears flow uncontrollably. \n\nI watched my hands move through dimensions, like a dance, creating impossible forms and sensations. Everything was harmonious, beautiful and vaguely uncomfortable \n\nDigital Painting  \nCompleted 2021  \n3300 x 2550  \n300 dpi",
