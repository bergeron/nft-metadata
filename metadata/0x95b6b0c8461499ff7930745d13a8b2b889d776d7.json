    "description": "When it comes to our existence, life, emotions and experiences, there are only feelings that describe it in the most authentic form.\n\nIn today's age, fortunately or unfortunately, we have all started to become like robots with technology being available at the tip of our fingers. We forgot the very essence of our entire existence being feelings that brought us to where we have reached individually in our lives.\n\nHow we defined and lived happiness.\nHow we used to spend our time without technology at our perusal.\n\nThis collection was birthed with the only focus being my raw and true feelings from the past to the present. They are all designed to feel different from each other. Just pure feelings.\n\nRanging from sadness, love, hopelessness, empathy, to feeling disappointed, finding success and everything in between. All of them are basically different emotions that play a role in your becoming today, which greatly contributes to your overall human development and purpose of life. \n\n1/12",
