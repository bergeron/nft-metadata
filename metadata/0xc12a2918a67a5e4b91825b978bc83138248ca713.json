    "description": "We attempt to connect while stuck in our silos occasionally bridging gaps and scaling walls. Some get taken down after years of wear and tear. Some get renovated and turned into something different or new and some are just repaired crack by crack. Some buildings stand together side by side for years, embracing their imperfections and stand united. \n\nThe impermanence of connections shows just how fragile and fleeting this life is.",
