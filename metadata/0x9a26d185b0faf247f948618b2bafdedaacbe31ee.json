    "description": "In this series of portraits, I use the fascinating medium of post-photography to renew the exploration of self-image, perception, emotions and reality.\n\nThese young women exist in an uncomfortable new layer of the human experience.\n\nSynthography enables us to repaint reality and give birth to chimeras beyond our imagination.\n\nAs AI grows close to submerging our everyday lives, I find it valuable to examine what makes us who we are, or pretend to be.\n\nDid they come into existence when I first encountered them?  \nOr were they already alive in latent space?  \nThe more people see them, the more they exist\n\nHas latent space always existed?  \nAre there infinite variations of these women?  \nSome crying, laughing, screaming?\n\nHow many more are waiting to be seen?  \nAre they portraits, pixels, beings?  \nGhosts in the machine?\n\nHyperreal like social media profiles  \nAlive in your mind  \nYour idea of a young woman\n\nWe exist in each other's eyes  \nReality is a consensual hallucination  \nNo woman is an island\n\nAre their emotions real?  \nHow do they make you feel?  \nHow about an actress in a movie scene?\n\nEmotional simulacra or natural reactions?  \nArtificial stimulation of the heart  \nLike a tearjerker song?\n\nAre we more than what is perceived?  \nHave we crossed the uncanny valley?  \nWe see what we want to see\n\nDo you feel like you know one of them?  \nMaybe she looks like you  \nOr how you wish you looked like",
