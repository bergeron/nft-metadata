    "description": "This artwork is inspired by a video I watched on Youtube, the video is about a Ramen cart operated by an old man at late night in Japan. The price of the ramen is cheap and it mostly serves people who work overtime and going home late at night. I think vendor like this fills a vital role in our society, as most restaurants don't open that late, and cooking by yourself doesn't seem like a good idea if you go home late. Nothing delivers warmth quite like hearty soups, a bowl of hot soup noodle is the best go-to comfort food when you feel so tired after overtime work.\n\nRamen cart is not often seen in my country, Malaysia (Well, I haven't seen one), but we do have Wonton Noodles cart on the street! Hence I drew this piece. :)\n\nItem type: MP4 Video File\nDimensions: 1920 x 1080",
