    "description": "The exact location. Coordinates on the map.\nReink City. Open the portal to come as you please, be and live as you wish.\nThe elf Quasar left the other world behind. \nMama Shu is upstairs accessing the oracles and coordinating the fragments. \nEveryone feels the light and shadow and decides where to go. We are no longer alone.\nThe first ritual is remarkable. Dissolve what the eyes see and realign again.\nPixels everywhere, portals opened, some go, others arrive. \nExperiences and moments of the past and present in a future where we can feel our deepest and most naive yearnings.\nTime and space. The mind resides in other skins. \nMake these bodies your home again.\n\n7500x2250\n\nThe first owner will receive a framed poster sized artwork and a NFT avatar inspired by this scene to be released on Opensea in 2022. Additionally, access to whitelist of planned exclusive fashion items inspired by my NFT works.",
