    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n\"NVM\" is the 3rd single from our PM album. The vocals are radio-ready and the track absolutely slaps. It's slap house - what do you expect? We made this one in Tuscany, Italy, in August and brought it back state-side. When we landed back in the US, we got stopped at customs because apparently the track was \"too fire\" and had caused a \"safety issue\". We hope we can provide heat to the rest of the world with this release.\n\nNext single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.",
