    "description": "In the big cat family, leopards would mostly be seen as small.  Weighing at an average 60 kilos, leopards are half the size of lions and tigers. But that isn't a curse but a blessing. A carefully designed hunting machine evolved to be best of the best. what leopards lack in size, they make up for in strength and stealth. With specialized senses and anatomy tailored for hunt, leopards can occasionally slay animals up to three times their size - and alone. To top it, these cats then drag those super heavy kills atop a tree, to keep it safe from stealers. \n\nTo get an idea of a leopard's strength, consider this - When pressed, leopards can run up to 60 kmph, leap upto 20 feet in one bound and jump more than 10 feet off the ground, exert enormous bite force of anywhere about 621 Newtons. Add to it Their proportionally large paws and claws which serves as the best climbing tools among the big cats. And the beautiful camo coat decorated by designer rosette patterns makes this cat close to impossible to spot during its stealth missions.",
