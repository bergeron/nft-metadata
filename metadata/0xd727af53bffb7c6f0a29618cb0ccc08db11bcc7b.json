    "description": "Taken in September 2022 Through layered windows of what is now a Bank, and what was once a shop called Bank. The constant change in cities keeps the street feeling fresh. I have several shots taken in the same location that I hope will be on chain eventually. The vast difference between some of the images will show why perseverance is so key in street photography. Being able to capture something that feels more blade runner than historic english town always makes me feel like I've had a successful day photographing.\n\nA7RIV  \n5218x3479  \n30/09/2022  \nCambridge UK",
