    "description": "Vladimir Putin has kept the Russian people hostage for decades He has started numerous wars and invaded neighbors, allied with worlds most hated dictators. He has starved and murdered millions of people before 2022.\n\nNow the whole world can see how much of a mad maniac he is. A man like that should not be allowed even near nuclear arsenal, yet he threatens the world with it. \n\nOn several occasions has stated that he is fighting a war that he cannot we win, he will make sure that everyone loses. He also said \"We don't need the world that doesn't have Russia in it\" while he of course thinks that he is Russia in its core.\n\nSuch man barely deserves a trial and needs to removed from society before he drags humanity to hell.",
