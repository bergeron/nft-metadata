    "description": "A Balinese royal inscription dated 896 AD speaks of irrigation tunnel builders. Today  the slopes of Bali’s volcanoes are honeycombed with tunnels that regularly flood the terraced ricefields. Water is treasured as a gift from a Goddess thought to dwell in the volcanic crater lakes,  acknowledged  by farmers with offerings in their fields.  Water is managed by subaks: groups of farmers who share water from  canals or springs. In 2012 subaks including Jatiluwih became a UNESCO  World Heritage.",
