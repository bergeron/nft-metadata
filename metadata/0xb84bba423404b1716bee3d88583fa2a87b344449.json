    "description": "Inspired by the design work of Bauhaus textile artists such as Gunta St√∂lzl, Anni and Josef Albers, 'Lebras' combines the proportions of both the Silver and Golden Ratios (1.414:1 and 1.618:1 respectively) to create a versatile five-column grid, within which unique compositions are formed. \n\nAs part of a semi-generative body of work, 'Rubicon' is a handmade remaster of a work-in-progress experimentation for the 'Lebras' collection.",
