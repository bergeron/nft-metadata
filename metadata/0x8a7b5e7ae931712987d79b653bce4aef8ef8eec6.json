    "description": "This animation is an artistic parody of the famous Wordle game where you have to guess the secret word, only in this Russian version, the opening word is always \"Putin\" and the secret word is always \"War\".\n\nI got the idea to create this piece after a protester was detained in Russia for holding up a poster saying \"*** *****\" (symbolizing \"нет войне”, “no to war”). \n\nThe middle row contains a capacious Russian swear word, which means the whole puzzle can be read as both “Putin, go f*ck yourself, war” and “Putin, why the f*ck war?”\n\n100% of the sales will be donated to the Reporters without Borders fund supporting independent Russian journalists who dare to speak up against the war.\n\nTechnical description: looped animation, mp4, 00:00:20:00, 2000 x 2000, 29,97 fps, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator",
