    "description": "This was one of those songs that took me back to a moment in time when I wrote it...\n\nEarly 2010\nHollywood, California\nLos Angeles Recording School\n\nI was 17 years old when I graduated high school. I almost immediately moved from Orange County to LA. I couldn't get out of my mom's house quick enough. I just wanted to feel like an adult. To be in my own apartment. To be in college. To just live.\n\nI thought going to recording school was the answer to all my prayers. I would learn everything I needed to know about recording + engineering. I would graduate and start making music. Then get signed. Then... I don't know. That was as far as I thought it through. Everything would go as planned.\n\nYeah... nope.\n\nSchool just wasn't for me. Los Angeles wasn't for me. Hollywood wasn't for me. And truthfully, there was a time when I thought music just wasn't for me.\n\nThis song is about that time.\n\nLooking back I feel like I needed that experience. I feel like understanding what we don't want is sometimes just as important as understanding what we do want.\n\nAnd I don't want that life. Of course I want to be able to live and create and provide for my family but I don't believe that the \"Hollywood Route\" is the only way.\n\nSo here we are 12 years later in Web 3 dropping NFTs and just figuring this sh*t out.\n\nAnd I'm not mad at it...\n\nThank you to all of you for showing me that there's another way.\n\nAll love, always.\n\nArtwork by GRAFIK (@grxfk)\nMastered by DJ Twinny Twin (@DJTwinnyTwin)\nProduced by Heydium\n\n-MRH",
