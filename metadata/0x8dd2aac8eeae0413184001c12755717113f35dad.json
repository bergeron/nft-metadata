    "description": "Project22x Founders Passes have been designed to reward our founder investors, through NFTs and ETH, so we use the 3D VR world to be our sketch pad and design, build on Unreal Engine to deliver a mirror representation of reality.  ​  In our case the project starts with an island in the Bahamas, and here we call it HQ. And here is where we learn, and produce, and market. The Island is where the worlds greatest performers will come each week to perform live, and beamed into P23X VR Metaverse, this is where the financial generator starts, a too good to be true low cost monthly access pass to our concerts from $10 , these passes will give access to a whole new world of entertainment, the rest of the island will always be open to guest and non concert goers.  ​  As there you will find VR sensory games and our famous Hot Lap Of the island, our own version on Mario Kart, meets Top Gear, compete online for prizes and rewards, or if your lucky enough your put down a time on the island E track, our version of the Top gear Track using no engine, pure electric go karts only on our clean fresh air Island. We call Spectrum X Island. That’s just a little  teaser into The Big Autism Project.",
