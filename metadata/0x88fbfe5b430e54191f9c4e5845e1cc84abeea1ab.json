    "description": "The day begins at the moment when the first glimmer of Sun touches the Earth, illuminating everything that inhabits it. Light wakes up every animated being and gives vital energy that sets in motion the wonderful process of life. Only if illuminated everything awakens: chlorophyll photosynthesis lights up and restores strength to every plant thanks to the presence of sunlight. Just as day follows night and light follows darkness, spring follows the torpor of winter, illuminating flowers and plants, infusing Life.\nObserving light investing everything and conferring existence, OOOPStudio pays homage to nature and its fulfilling presence, capturing the moment of a new beginning and its beauty, investigating its cyclicality. As in reality, so in the artwork Luce Sintetica, light is the fundamental generator element and it is from the light that digital, organic and pulsating sculptures come to life, created through video",
