    "description": "The form is the external form in which the objective image exists in the space. Any object image exists in its specific form to distinguish it from other objects. Shape belongs to the basic basis and constant factor of sketch modeling. When we observe an object image, we should first pay attention to its basic shape as a whole. If the basic shape of the object image is different, the physical characteristics of the object image will be different.",
