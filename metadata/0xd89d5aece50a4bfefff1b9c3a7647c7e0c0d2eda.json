    "description": "Blue Mind  1/1\n\nPart of the Wish You Water collection, Blue Mind is a perfect send off. Inspired by the book \"Blue Mind\" By Wallace J Nichols, this piece embodies the element of calm we seek in the deep blue. Taken 50 miles off the coast of Oahu in waters that went as deep as 5000 feet, I was dropped off the boat to explore the baron blue. A galaxy of hues that traveled right to the receptors of my brain with solace and gratitude. It was a beautiful silence I have never heard before that moment. Lost in my Blue Mind was exactly where I wanted to be.\n\nPhoto taken circa 2016\nMinted 2022\n\nComes with signed 20x30 limited edition fine art print\nas well as early access to Thousand Waves Project.\n",
