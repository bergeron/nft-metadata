    "description": "NFA Comics, Issue #1, March 2023\n\nAs we discover new grounds and explore new paths of being and interacting, we need to make sure that we do so in a safe way, mindful of the importance of our goals.\n\nWe all start from the FOOL position, excited about new beginnings and ignorant about potential dangers but the security of our bag is as strong as our desire to educate ourselves.\n\nRemember to always check. If it's too good to be true it probably IS.\n\nOTC without doing your due diligence is like throwing money hoping it lands in the ATM.\n\nTrust airdrops like you trust a free drink from a stranger at the club.",
