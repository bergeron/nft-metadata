    "description": "A dialogue on consciousness and the endless (and helpless) pursuit thereof. The sphere representing consciousness and being. The hand reaching out of the solidified ground showing the impossible feat of reaching consciousness. \n\nConsciousness cannot be captured, sought after, desired, or pursued. It can only be lived, here and now.",
