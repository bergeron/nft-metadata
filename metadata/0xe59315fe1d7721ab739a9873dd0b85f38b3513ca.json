You already heard bout of them, they have most of the amount of a currencies like BTC. actually they're human like us and I wanted to express that with you, I have drawn an eye for the whale like humans, I think eye's has a lot of story to tell us without say any words. A person with emotions behind that lore story about them, and they can mistakes too it means they're not robots. But all the people not be good all the time, they can play with ordinary people to forced them to walk in what way they want...\n\nI worked on this piece more than +20 hours and put my best I can do and a good story behind it. I changed the concept many times and changed many palette colors to found what I think is best for artwork and eventually I created this work.\n\nExplore it, you can find many easter eggs on this work like human eye with emotions I told you before. I know you can find them.\n\nJPG | 3250 x 2835 | 9.45MB",
