    "description": "This is part of a collection about society’s attitude towards women in various historical sections. This point of view has recognized and judged women only by their basic instincts.\n\nThis is an “Elamite” woman from distant antiquity at the twilight of civilization history with her handmade clay ornaments. A calm and speechless woman, who was obedient and isolated despite her social status.\nAccepting others’ attitudes towards herself, she has left a vague trace of her thoughts and ideas.\n\nPhysical details\nAcrylic on Canvas\n25*35 cm\n2015\n\n\n",
