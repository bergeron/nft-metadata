    "description": "This photo was taken in Chefchaouen, the \"Blue City\" in Morocco, which served as a refuge for Jews escaping the victorious rulers of the 15th century in Spain. After settling in Morocco, Spanish Jews painted their houses' walls blue, symbolising the sky. Roman captures patina and cracks on the blue facades to recount the tale of individuals' timeless pursuit of salvation.\n[If you purchase the NFT, kindly fill out this form to provide your information.](https://forms.gle/u3pKPinstj1kHQ4d8)"
