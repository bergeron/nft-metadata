    "description": "Throughout this collection are dehumanised images of pornstars created by a machine learning algorithm that was trained on the first 4000 images to appear on google after searching pornstars.\n\nWhat is produced is the algorithm's understanding of what it is to be a pornstar. It has spent hours looking at the images and the features shown most are what it saw the most. \n\nWhat we learn from these artworks is actually how pornstars are represented on the internet. \n\nThe algorithm has learnt only white skin, it has struggled to learn the nipple, the women are all but some topless and with long flowing blonde hair. \n\nThis is not a true representation of the millions of beautiful and amazing pornstars that exist everyday around the world. But a true representation of images available of pornstars on google images.\n\nIt must be fixed.",
