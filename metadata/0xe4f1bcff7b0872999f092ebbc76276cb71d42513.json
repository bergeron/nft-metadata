    "description": " Kung Fu is rooted in the philosophy of TAOISM (pronounced as ‘DAOism’) first practiced by Chinese Monks who eventually founded the Shaolin Temple. The TAO which translates as ‘The way’ is considered to be a transcendent force and the source of all creation.\n\nI am minting 36 unique 1 of 1 photographs I made while in Zhengzhou Henan Province, China in 2016, aiming to create a body of work focused on discipline, strength and mindfulness. By collecting one of these pieces called chambers you are ultimately  participating in a transfer of energy formed between artist and collector.\n\nLocation: Shaolin Temple\nYear: 2016\nPhotographer: Naskademini\n\nUTILITY:\n1st Minters: Receive 24\"X36\" Archival Print Signed & Numbered With Certificate Of Authenticity\nSecondary Market Minters: Receive 11\"X17\" Archival Print Signed & Numbered With Certificate Of Authenticity",
