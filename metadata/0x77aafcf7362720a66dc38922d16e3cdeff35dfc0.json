    "description": "**Have you ever felt as if submerged, without having your head underwater? This guy knows what it's like**. \n\nFirst scene of the life and story of the peculiar **Green Hatted Man**. His house, his pets, his rules. \n\n\n\n**4000px x 4000px at 280 dpi** (High Quality PDF Available)\n\n**1/20**\n\nCreated by **Jobless_Architect (Cristian Galilea)**\n\n**Digitally-hand made, brought straight from the images of a wandering mind**.\n\nNo road map nor weird stuff; just -**l'art pour l'art**-\n\nThis project was given shape with the idea that a drawing or a piece of art can only be framed to some extent. But what you can't frame is the **imagination of the beholder**. The artist may have had a motiv, but what comes to meet the eye of the viewer is entirely based upon his cultural livings and experiences.\n\nThe creator of the project is an architecture student from **Chile, South America**, whom firmly believes that art would not be as interesting, if it was to be looked at always by the same eye.",
