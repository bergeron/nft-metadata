    "description": "This was the first ballpoint pen portrait I ever did when I found my way back to drawing a few years ago after a 20 year hiatus.  I chose Lance Mountain for my first portrait because he is my all-time favorite skateboarder.  The first video I ever saw was 'The Search for Animal Chin' and I was immediately drawn to Lance's sense of humor and style.  My first \"real\" skateboard was a Lance Mountain pink 'Future Primitive' deck. Lance will always be the first, and the best.   I used the stipple technique for this drawing and it is made up of millions of dots, composed over the course of 150 hours with a simple Bic ballpoint pen.  Funds from this token will be distributed among Arto, Lance, and myself.",
