    "description": "The area of transition between the world and the Pale is called \"porch collapse\". \n\nThe \"Porch Collapse\" series is heavily inspired by the concept of the Pale in the world of Disco Elysium. The Pale is achromatic, odourless, and featureless, the \"enemy of matter and life\". Therefore, it can only be measured through the matter that surrounds it. It is not *like* any other - or *any* thing in the world. It is the transition state of being into nothingness. It is a \"location without a defined location, into which one’s memories scramble with others' and no one’s.\" \n\nBy the time I became familiar with the Pale I had already started working on the series, so my plan wasn't to make a direct translation of it in photographic form. Finding out about the Pale only further solidified my idea. In a way, both the concept of the Pale and my work are ways to illustrate something that is mostly in the realm of intuition and outside of language and description. ",
