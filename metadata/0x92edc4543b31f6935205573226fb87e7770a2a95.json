    "description": "Chapter 1, in which Isaac is left alone. Or just realized that he is alone, though in fact he has been for a long time. He's cramped in here. A small room, a single bed. Everything here reminds him of a past life. And outside the window it's raining, and the full moon is lighting a train that's going somewhere far away. Somewhere he'd like to go, too. But will he be able to hide from his past life there? Maybe. Maybe not. \n",
