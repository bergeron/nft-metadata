    "description": "\"E-motion\" is based on the idea of bringing human emotion into data and utilize it on AI and machine learning research. \n\nIn this project I used data captured from several painting composites and mental illness datasets (from Kaggle) and tried to find a way to approach the pattern structures of human emotions. \n\nThe visuals were created on touchdesigner and glsl, and use data for particle movements. Audio made in VCV rack, a kind of Analog Syth simulator.\n\nThe buyer of this NFT will also receive the Full HQ Version (1920*1080 resolution,30 FPS , 2:53 length).",
