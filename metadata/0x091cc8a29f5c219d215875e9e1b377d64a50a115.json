    "description": "Landing (2019) is the silent witness of the artist’s early life in a Paris suburban area where he was raised. His parents moved into this apartment in January 1975 when he was five years old. \n\nLanding is a deconstruction and recreation of this physical location’s temporality, leaving just the mention of the years as the sole witness of the evolution of the artist’s creative process.\n\nThe series \"Landing\" is composed of seventeen pieces made to be displayed all together, on one white wall, one foot from each other.\n\nLanding I, 2019 (Minted in 2023), MPEG-4 movie, 1080 x 1080 pixels, 1/1.",
