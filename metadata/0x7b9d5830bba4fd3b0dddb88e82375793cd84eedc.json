    "description": "During the pandemic - everything as we know came to a halt.\nBusinesses closed down...we suffered.\n\nI went on Worldstar one day and saw a video of a news report saying that sex workers were thriving, an all time high...that moment I started daydreaming thinking what would really drive someone to seek this out during the pandemic and possibly become addicted, fall in love.. \"That sparked the first line \"But when you're paid good for it, take ya' soul by force..\" the rest was history.\n\nSince I've been out of the loop for a lil bit, figured i'd come back with at least a gift.",
