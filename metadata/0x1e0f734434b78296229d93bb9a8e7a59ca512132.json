    "description": "“What whisky will not cure, there is no cure for.”\n\nThis is the story of a whisky blogger who hasn't stopped sharing and being interested in whisky for almost 10 years and uses his curiosity very strongly in order to direct the industry.\n\nEven though he was tired of the constant travels, he wanted to travel alone to South America and take time for himself to write his book.\n\n\"I remember hearing \"Whisky & NFT\" words in the same sentences for the first time from Mert and getting really excited about it. This piece of art just reminds me how the world is moving forward so fast and we all need to be ready for new things and find new hobbies, places, friends and (of course) whiskies to enjoy.\" Barış Mercan\n\nI will donate half of the proceeds from the sale of Whisky Blogger to TEMA Foundation in Turkey -located in Sisli, Istanbul. Because the soil is the home of all of us, the direct or indirect source of 95% of our food, the source of endurance of our habitats.",
