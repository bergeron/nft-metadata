    "description": "Humanity.\n\nOn February 24th 2022  the bombarding on Ukraine by Putins Regime has begun, which changed the lives and destinies of millions of people.\n\nThis war has been going since 2014. Since my family is half Ukrainian half Russian it used to be a heavily discussed topic with many different opinions. Having the luck to grow up in Germany I can not tell what it feels like being a teen in a country that has been torn in two, but I saw what trauma it has caused to my family, which fled from Crimea in 2014 and now had to flee from Kiev in 2022.\n\nWithin this short period of time this war has caused more than 1.5  million people to flee, leaving everything behind.\n\nIt has caused childhood trauma, deaths and young men from 18 y/o being armed with weapons who've never been at war. \n\nTHIS IS WRONG! No one wins at war! \n\nAll earnings from this NFT will be used to support people in Ukraine and will be donated to NOVAUKRAINE as well as to creating further NFTâ€™s to support as many as we can.",
