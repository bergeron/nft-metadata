    "description": "This is the 1st NFT in a collection of 10 photographs that have been issued as a single, unique edition.\n\nPhoto: 7000  x  7000 px\n\nMeeting the people and tribes of Namibia was a very important part of my trip. \n\nTribes have an immense historical importance not only to Namibia's ancient cultural heritage, but also to its present. \n\nBut most of all I remember the children’s incredibly deep eyes, in which there was so much history, so many words they could not yet utter.\n\nMany of them will live all their lives in these tribes. \n\nA unique tribal world that has survived and thrived for thousands of years. Amazing!",
