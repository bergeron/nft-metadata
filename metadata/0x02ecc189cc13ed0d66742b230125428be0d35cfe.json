    "description": "This recent work by FREQ was intended to be exhibited alongside the 'Art of Banksy' traveling exhibition during the spring/summer of 2021. Unfortunately, due to lockdown restrictions, the exhibition was promptly closed and this piece was never exhibited or shared with the public. The artwork features a character fondling a banana while waving a flag emblazoned with the tag 'Wanksy', a playful nod to Banksy's own tag with a rotated 'B'. Despite the humor and irreverence of the piece, it also invites viewers to reflect on the subversive power of street art and the ways in which it challenges societal norms and expectations. This is the first ever FREQ NFT as a premium 3D digital artwork. Holders can view the NFT in Augmented Reality. Purchase of this Artist Proof Edition unlocks a physical 18x24in Hahnem√ºhle Bamboo limited print made from 90% bamboo fibres. Soft surface texture and impressive print quality gives the artwork outstanding expression and soul. Edition: 1 of 13",
