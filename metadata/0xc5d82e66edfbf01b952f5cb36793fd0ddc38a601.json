    "description": "Sometimes when something happens in life and you feel like everything is falling to pieces, it’s hard to keep up with the thoughts of being broken. Sometimes things aren’t really that bad, but memories of the past can haunt you for a long time. It’s easy to get stuck thinking about “what ifs”. When you put a lot of love, time & energy into someone or something and they disappear from your life, you can feel hollow. But then you heal.. because you have to. It might take a lot of time, but you still have to try. Maybe some of you can relate. This piece is about the journey from Hurt.. to Letting go.. to Focusing on the present. \n\nI don't know what else to say. My heart broke - and I got fucked up. This is what it sounds like when you get fucked up. But I don't blame anyone.\n\nThanks for listening. I'm glad you could hear me cry.\n\n\n\n",
