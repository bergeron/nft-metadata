    "description": "Inspired by the vague memory I have about my grandpa's favorite room back in the 90s. I remember the smell, the fuzzy aroma of old books and records, piled up on the floor and the bookshelves. \nIn the middle: his favorite, cozy, sofa. It was made on a 113x113 canvas but expanded to a larger version to appreciate it better.",
