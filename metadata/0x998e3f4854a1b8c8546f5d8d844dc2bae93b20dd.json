    "description": "ULTIMATE BENTO summarizes the things I want to do in Japan. I want to wear a pretty Kimono, eat authentic Japanese food, cherish the sweetness of dango or the savory taste of ramen and even enjoy a matcha-flavored ice cream. I want to experience the first bloom of cherry blossoms and be in awe of the sight of golden Ginkgo leaves. I also want to visit different castles and shrines, see the red torii gates and bring home some omamori charms. The list goes on. \n\nJapan is one of my top destinations and I hope I can save money to visit someday. I want to experience and see the actual places and food I only see on my screen.\n\n\n*** This illustration is originally a part of my 40 paged self-published coloring book. Now, I'm bringing the pages to life in full color.\n\n5232px x 3375px 300 dpi\n",
