    "description": "Welcome to the Cocktail Party, by Stoots. Would you like some wine?\n\nAn unique art collection with beverage people. Elegant, simple and powerful. \n\nCreated by a team of artists dedicated to make quality digital artwork, The Cocktail Party (CKP) is a NFT project with high standard. In the future, we'll be featuring a Comic Book with these lovely characters!\n\nWineman, or Casillero de Los Angeles is a quiet man. Always sitting next to the door, humming some romantic old music. \n\n\"Ohh, the oldies. I miss the good times. I miss having a blast with my friends, I miss going out at night thinking that nothing could stop us. I miss you too, Beatrice.\" ",
