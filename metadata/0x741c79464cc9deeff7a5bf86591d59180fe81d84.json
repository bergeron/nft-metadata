    "description": "-I suggest you look at the piece with too much zoom-\n\nthis is a piece that took 2,5 months to finish after the process of creating my collection. there are many characters and images in it. 100x70 acrylic and mixed and chemical media based work. \n\nIn the center of the work I have card drawings made up of squares and then as you go further down I have added small scenes that you look at very closely.\n\nAfter doing it a little bit I realized that this is a character.\n\ni wanted this piece to deal with two themes and i created a more colorful theme on the left side and a darker theme on the right side. there is a very heavy crowd even for blue. that might be the reason why this piece is a poem.",
