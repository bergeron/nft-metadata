    "description": "The second to the last of Charles's Art.\n\nHe woke up one night and just starting painting in his studio.\n\nI asked him if he was ok and he said everything will be fine because he dreamt that an angel came to see him and told him everything.\n\nThough the said angel wasn't what he had imagined, he said while crying \"I'm happy\".\n\nCharles then continued on to paint the angel while saying:\n\n\"He was a kind man with black wings and looked like as though he was from Japan's Edo period.\n\nHe told me not to be afraid and that he knows he doesn't look like what others imagine angels to be but he's my guide and will be in the \"in between\" until it is my time to pass on. I couldn't see his face but I could tell that he was giving me a smile and the entire time we talked, laughed and the moments I cried, I thanked him for everything.\"\n\nThe proceeds from this auction will go to the kids with terminal illness under Make A Wish Philippines. One that Charles was fully devoted on supporting.",
