    "description": "This image is my Hello! to the NFT world. It was inspired by psychedelic art from the 70s and the visions I had in altered states of mind when the colours flow through the veins and the world spins around in a motley merry-go-round. And suddenly you can see what happens under the skin and how the trees grow from the inside.\n\nIf somebody offers 1,5 ETH in primary sale I will send the original physical drawing to the buyer.\nMade in 2019, 50x40 cm, coloured pencils and ball pen on Japanese Taizan mulberry paper.",
