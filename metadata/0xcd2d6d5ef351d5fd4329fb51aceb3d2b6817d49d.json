    "name": "“Carina / Archetypal Figure” ",
    "description": "\"The archetypal figure of love, beauty, desire, and creation, Carina finds herself puffy eyed and weepy from the emotions that loom. They sit on her chest plate and pick up like fall leaves spiraling in the wind. Red for anger, ocher for confusion, umber for defeat, chartreuse for envy, and another gust rips up the throat —pausing for a moment behind her eyes, and with the wimpiest of whimpers, her Rosie cheeks glisten with spring showers. It’s time to start anew. She knows she’s found herself here before and that realization musters more frustration but then three deep breaths let it go. Aphrodite in the flesh, her battles never sees. A little laugh. She knows it’s true. Deep contemplations drive her crazy yet it’s what she’s trained to do. Carina’s curls bounce at her shoulders while her head shakes left to right. With each exhale another muttered curse word — then quick admonishment: she knows she should only speak positivity into the universe. That is her purpose after all.\"",
