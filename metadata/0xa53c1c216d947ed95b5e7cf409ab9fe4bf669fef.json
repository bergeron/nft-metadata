    "description": "story:\nShe always loved him, even when they decided to broke up eachother. And, finally they broke up, after years. But, she couldn't withstand that situation. She knew everything is over for her, and she didn't know what to do with her broken heart. \nFinally she decided to abandon her last life, her memories and her feelings. She wore her  Spacesuit which always imagined in her dreams. She was ready to immigrate, while she had a tear on her cheek and she was thinking to her awful experiences that she had had. She tried to be strong and just left with her broken heart. The sky was dancing for her. Milky way on the earth which is one part of our galaxy arms, was the only way that could transfer her to another home. Maybe in other parts of our galaxy, people don't break heart of eachother!\n\n• An original Nft / hand-drawn digital art\n• To be remembered for First image from James Webb Space Telescope, which opened a new door to the universe, new galaxies and maybe new people!\n•  July 2022\n",
