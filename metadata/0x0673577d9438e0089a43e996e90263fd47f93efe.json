    "name": "The Red Wall",
    "description": "Designed by postmodernist architect Ricardo Bofill in 1973, La Muralla Roja (The Red Wall) asks to be considered as a case apart. It embodies a clear reference to the popular architecture of the Arab Mediterranean, in particular to the adobe towers of North Africa. It sits prominently atop a seaside cliff in Calpe, Spain.\n\nThe outside surfaces are painted in various tones of red, to accentuate the contrast with the landscape; patios and stairs, however, are treated with blue tones, such as sky-blue, indigo, and violet, to produce a stronger or weaker contrast with the sky or, on the contrary, an optical effect of blending in with it. The intensity of the colours is also related to the light and shows how the combination of these elements can help create a greater illusion of space.",
