    "name": "The Oracle",
    "description": "This artwork is based on the oracle of Goddess Bhadrakali, known as ‘Velichappadu’. \nThe Malayalam word ‘Velichappadu’ can be vaguely translated to ‘the one who throws light.' The female Velichappadu is predominantly present during the Bharani festival of Kerala. The devotees firmly believe that the Velichappadu has the power to communicate with the deity. They are adorned in an enchanting red attire, ritual ornaments and garlands to represent the form of the Goddess, carrying a unique sword with small bells attached. They dance in a trance under the divine influence and yell out lewd, abusive cries at the goddess, which is said to please her. As they come out of this godly trance state, the Velichappadu slashes their forehead repeatedly with the sword and offers their blood to the deity as a symbol of unshakeable faith.\n\nArtwork: Namitha Raveendranathan \nMusic: Ganesh Venkataramani\nMotion Graphics: Francis Kurien\nContent: Athira Raj\n",
