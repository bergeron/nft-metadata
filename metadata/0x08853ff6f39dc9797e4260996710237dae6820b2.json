    "description": "speak not, lie hidden, and conceal\nthe way you dream, the things you feel.\ndeep in your spirit let them rise\nakin to stars in crystal skies\nthat set before the night is blurred:\ndelight in them and speak no word.\n\nhow can a heart expression find?\nhow should another know your mind?\nwill he discern what quickens you?\na thought once uttered is untrue.\ndimmed is the fountainhead when stirred:\ndrink at the source and speak no word.\n\nlive in your inner self alone\nwithin your soul a world has grown,\nthe magic of veiled thoughts that might\nbe blinded by the outer light,\ndrowned in the noise of day, unheard...\ntake in their song and speak no word.\n\n\"Silentium\"\nby Fyodor Tyutchev\ntranslated by Vladimir Nabokov",
