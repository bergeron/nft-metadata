    "description": "As fish are found in all different habitats around the world, from deep in the ocean to shallow streams, fish have evolved and adapted to their respective habitats in fascinating ways. For instance, some species of fish navigate and hunt through electroreception, a process by which they detect and respond to electrical stimuli, to learn things such as the speed of the current. This NFT shows the human inviting the lone fish into her helmet for protection from the outside world.",
