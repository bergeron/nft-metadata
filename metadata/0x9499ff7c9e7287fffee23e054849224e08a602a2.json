    "description": "Cascade Dreamscape\n\nFrom my very first backpacking adventure in the North Cascades in September 2019.\n\nNot many people would willingly set foot into the mountains if they knew a blizzard was forecast for the landscape, but my friend Brock and I didn't allow that to faze us. We made our way through the moody, foggy landscape until we reached our destination for the night. Clouds swirled over Mount Shuksan and slowly revealed the jagged beauty that stood overtop of us. This view only lasted for a few minutes before the clouds closed yet again and unleashed their wintery fury upon us for the next 18 hours. A full on blizzard hammered our tent as we huddled inside and awaited the sunrise the following morning. \n\nAs cold as it may have been, I wouldn't have changed this experience in way, shape, or form. These moments of discomfort test us in ways that we don't experience in our day to day lives and I truly believe that they force us to embrace whatever is thrown our way and they force us to be ever present.",
