    "description": "Who doesn’t wish they could be Satan, just for a day, operating without the prick of a conscience?\nMy modern Mephistopheles is a tow-truck driver, winching up the car of a grandmother who pleads with him but her dismay amuses him.\nThis photograph is a critique of how draconian the rules of society can be. Satan has the authority to tow grandmother’s car away, but is it the right thing to do? As a society, we devise laws that are meant to make society a just place for all—but we fail so often. This a 1/1 animated edition.",
