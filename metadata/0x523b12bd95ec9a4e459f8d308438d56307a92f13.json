    "description": "The End Of Things\n\n\nThe temporal space is a heap of badly arranged boxes.\nIf everything disappears. What is left?\nDo you exist?\nYour skin, my pain, my mourning, my joys, my laughter, \nLost forever in a memory of your own.\n\nVirtual memory of an ideal reality.\nWhich is only in power.\nThe act has abandoned.\nNothing lasts.\n\nThe famous needle. The ultimate limit. \nReaper of my decision. \nAbrupt end to my courage. \n\nThe madness is to believe that it will change by repeating the same thing every day. \n\nNot even this pixel is eternal.\nI am 2.54 centimeters away from my happiness,\nImmaterial but not abstract.\nToo far, so close, or already gone,\nThe possible looks like the real,\nIt just lacks existence.\n\nINFORMATIONS : \n\nEdition : 01/01 - Unique\n\nNft created from the photographic series 'The End on Things' visible on my website www.marinefoissey.com\n\nSize : 1474x2208\nTime : 00:25\nMP4\n",
