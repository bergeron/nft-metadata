    "description": "The performance \"WORDS\" was originally conceived as a new way to unite me, people and the space around with each other.\nDuring the performance, a lot changed, I felt something that I had never felt before. The fear of getting out of your comfort zone, seem absurd and ridiculous mixed with the fear of people interacting with something new and unusual in their everyday life. Time ceases to matter, you don't see anyone who touches you, you don't know what you look like - it all removes responsibility from you for what you are constantly trying to keep under control.\nCreativity for me is an intimate process in which it is difficult not to doubt yourself.\n\nIn this debut performance, I wanted to switch places, I wanted to let go of control in order to understand how interaction is important in what I do. That sometimes you just need to be able to listen, and feel, and not stop at clear specifics.\n\nü§çA part of the money will go to help the Ukrainian refugees and help centers. Make art not war",
