    "description": "The Hubble was fascinating enough, but the Webb telescope has shed new light or rather captured more light than ever before possible resulting in astounding fantastic images of our Universe in motion and formation.\n\nThe same forces that have caused the gases, dust, and other elements of the universe to coalesce into galaxies, stars, planets, moons and asteroids can be reproduced in a petri dish or in this case, in an artist studio.\n\nUsing various inks, liquids in combination with different substrates I have been harnessing these same forces to create my own fictional universes.
