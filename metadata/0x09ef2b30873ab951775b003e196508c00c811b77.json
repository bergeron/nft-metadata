    "description": "Astro Cat was used to stargazing from a distance. All his life he had wondered what those little flashing lights are that come out every night, but no one knew how to answer all those questions. Astro Cat is a very curious cat, and that is why he decided that if no one knew how to give him answers, he would have to go out and find them. At the beginning, he felt very alone and scared in the vastness of space. However, little by little he realized that there are many more things up there than can be seen from down here. Maybe Astro Cat is lost but he no longer feels so alone.",
