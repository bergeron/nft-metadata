    "description": "Self-published in June 2019, Grimoire is the first collection of Gossamer Rozen lore signaling the marriage of conceptual art, world building, and sequential art. The style presented here informed Gossamer’s iterations on tattoo designs, fine art illustrations, and NFT projects such as Bestiary, Mrammou, and Tigerbob. Inspiration for Gossamer’s work builds on arcane topics including grimoires (books of magic), tarot cards, sigils, automatic writing, and bestiaries (collections of beasts and the natural world). For Gossamer, art is a type of healing magic that comes directly from the mind and manifests into the world, taking many forms.\n\nThis NFT collection is the first time Grimoire has been presented digitally for the public. The book was printed at home and hand-bound by Gossamer in 2019. Less than 30 editions of the physical book exist in circulation.",
