    "description": "In this art you will see me. Behind my back is Mars, I am a Scorpio, and Mars rules this sign. On my shoulder sits the bird Quetzal. Quetzal is the bird of freedom, and it is also a sacred bird for the Mayans. I was beginning to forget what it was like to feel free. A tree grows from my back. This tree symbolizes my soul. my soul grows strong again and blooms like this tree. my heart, which I now have tethered, will stay with me. may this art symbolize a new life for me.",
