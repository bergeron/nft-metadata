    "description": "Sketching forms the foundation of all my work. Each painting, mural, collage and sculpture starts behind the pad with a pencil. \n\nTo celebrate a 20 year evolution of dedication and style, I created this sketch for my limited edition sketchbook that was released in 2017. \n\nSketching feels like an endless loop that brings me in a hyperfocus state where I can be free to push my visual boundaries as an artist. Iâ€™m never not sketching.",
