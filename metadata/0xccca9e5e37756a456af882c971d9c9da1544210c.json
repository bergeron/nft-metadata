    "description": "The Sanctuary of Christ the King (Portuguese: Santuário de Cristo Rei) is a Catholic monument and shrine dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ overlooking the city of Lisbon situated in Almada, in Portugal. It was inspired by the Christ the Redeemer statue of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil after the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon visited that monument. The project was inaugurated on 17 May 1959. The giant statue was built to express gratitude because Portugal was spared the direct destructive effects of World War II. The statue of Christ is 28m high and rests on a base of more than 80m high. The view that one can enjoy from the monument is absolutely impressive and it covers about 20km. On a clear day one can see the iconic 25th Abril Bridge as well as the historical districts of Lisbon, the surroundings of the capital city all the way to Seixal Bay, the Serra da Arrábida mountains and if you are really lucky, also Sintra.",
