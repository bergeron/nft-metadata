    "description": "This was my first time photographing That Wanaka Tree and also my most viral image. A unique, captivating scene from one of the world's most photographed trees. \n\nWhile setting up for a sunset shoot, I watched the incredible lenticular cloud formations hovering over the mountains like UFO's. Without quite knowing how their motion would resolve with a long exposure, I set the camera to take a 130sec shot. The chaos of the lakes surface smoothed out as expected, and the dominate lenticular structure took on the look of the USS Enterprise traveling at warp. \n\nThe iconic tree does it's best to remain the feature of this photo, yet the clouds in the skies of Wanaka steal the show.\n\n--Holders of this token can claim a 5% discount per token (up to 50%) on all eligible primary sale NFT artworks by Kieran Stone--",
