    "description": "Jack the Rapper aka Jack the Ripper (he went through a rough patch) was an English rapper. Between 1888 and 1892, he murdered several rap battles—all in the slums of England—in or near the Whitechapel district of London’s East End. Jack the Rapper never lost a rap battle and remained undefeated. Today his rap battle sites are the locus of a macabre tourist industry in London.",
