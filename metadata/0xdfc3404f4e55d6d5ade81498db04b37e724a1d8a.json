    "description": "The photo was taken in the small town of Trogir in Croatia. The play of light perfectly emphasizes the dynamics of touristic curiosity while disrupting the serenity of stone walls and \"Tiramola\" clotheslines. For me, this photo represents the idea that for real, deeper and true experience of a space, it is always necessary to look beyond the surface and walk into a dark street because there we will find that forgotten, authentic and real world we are looking for.\n\nOne \"Umbrella\" edition will be airdropped to the primary collector.\n\nAwards: \"6th Circular Exhibition of Photography\" ZETA CIRCUIT 2021, Montenegro (Fiap 2021/209)- Salon Honorable Mention\n\n\nTitle: Dalmatia\n\nCollection: Timeless B&W\n\nArtist: Diana Junakovic\n\nYear: 2019\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nWeb: https://linktr.ee/dianajunakovic\n\n\nAbout the Artist: Diana Junakovic is Croatian award winning photographer, Master of Arts and holder of AFIAP.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
