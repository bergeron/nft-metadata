    "description": "This piece is about how we navigate our inner self-talk, our mindset. Our inner discourse is, in a parallel way, both positive and negative, dark and positive, naturally, live side by side in our mind.\n\nTo navigate through life, while remaining efficient and enjoying the experience we must learn to tame this duality within us, Instead of letting it roam free side by side we must bury our darker self-talk. We must suffocate it with positivity fueled by realism. \n\nWhen we do so, when we tame our inner beast, there is a glow of victory in our mind's conscience, a blue glow of trust, a paragon of success spotted from miles away. By admiring this piece you are cordially invited to experiment, to quash briefly your darker side, smother it, and feel the radiance of a trustful self. Glow. Remember this feeling, practice it daily. Center yourself, make yourself shine blue.\n\n\nThis digital painting was created via mixed digital mediums, by Yaki Bianco in 2022; 4000x4000, PNG.",
