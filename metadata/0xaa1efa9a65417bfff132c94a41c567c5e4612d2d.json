    "description": "I'm used to pretending that everything is fine, I feel dirty and sore, I'm infected, but you don't know that. From so much enduring I have begun to explode, I am in the bones and the worms make nests in me. My soul is already escaping and I am dividing in two, another me is born from my skin and I don't know where to go, because of this nesting anxiety and I don't know how to ask for peace. For the world everything is fine, I am fine, nothing is happening..",
