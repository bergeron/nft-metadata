    "description": "They follow me. Wherever I go, whatever I do, they don't leave me.\nI tear, I fight, I reach for the light. I fly toward it, I fall into it. But this vortex full of viscous and bitter memories keeps dragging behind me. This vortex of sick thoughts - crows want to peck me, and the more I resist, the closer they fly.\nIt's like we're alone in space, like there's nothing else. It's just me and my battle with my inner pain, with these dark crows from which there is no hiding.\nWill I be able to reconcile with them by feeding them? Will they leave me if I stop running? Would I be able to accept my dark side...?",
