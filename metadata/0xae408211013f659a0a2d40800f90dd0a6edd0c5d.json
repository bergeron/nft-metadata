    "description": "She was a student at the university.\nA handsome man walked past her. Since then she couldn't forget that smile and smell of his perfume. She fell in love with him from the first sight.\n2 years later, He - that handsome man stood in front of her as a teacher, her heart started beating fast and she felt that it was becoming hard for her to breathe, she had an inner panick. The journey into her dreams started where  they were together alone,  as his big and strong hands touched her hips hugging her tightly to him, his lips touched her lips. She wanted to confess, but she realized that it was impossible, inappropriate and a fleeting attraction. She kept that secret for 3 years.\nGraduation was coming. He asked her to stay for a while, there was a talk. She couldn't believe that it was happening to her. He confessed, he was in love with her too. She was over the moon and her dream came true.\n\n1/1 art\n3000 x 3500 pxl 400 dpi",
