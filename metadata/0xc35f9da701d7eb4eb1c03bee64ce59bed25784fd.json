    "description": "La Habana has a charm that you won't find anywhere else. I believe that if you want to capture the real essence of a country, the best place to find it is on the streets. In Cuba, everywhere you go people are outdoors doing business, talking with friends, enjoying a cigar, playing, or simply watching the world go by.  It is one of the most photogenic countries I have ever visited.  \n\nThis moment was a special one. It reminded me of the simple beautiful things in life. ",
