    "description": "\"Growing\" is a powerful collection of images that depicts solo women from diverse backgrounds cultivating cannabis, serving as a symbol for the growth and empowerment of women's rights and cannabis legalization. This collection not only celebrates the growth of the cannabis industry, but also draws attention to the importance of protecting the rights of marginalized groups, such as women and cannabis consumers. Through this project, we hope to inspire a movement towards a more equitable and inclusive world, where everyone can flourish and thrive.\n\n5824 x 3264 px",
