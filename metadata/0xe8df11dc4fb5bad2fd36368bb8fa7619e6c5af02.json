    "description": "An end to the long-time moaning...\n When I entered the forest in the morning, I did not expect anything.  But there is no lack of desire in the mind.. We entered the forest by hearing the sound of birds.  With the remnants of the night's rain, the blades of grass are bare with snowdrops.  Cool atmosphere.  Like losing sight in a fog.  Eyes and mind were wandering in search of the tiger. Suddenly the driver speeds up the car.  TIGER!  Everyone's eyes roamed the forest.  Beside us... the sight of her walking with her head held high in the wildness of the forest... the forest is wild for the tiger.  The camera eyes were constantly capturing her every move.  Seeing a tiger in the forest is more beautiful than seeing a tiger alone...\n So these photos are my favorite...",
