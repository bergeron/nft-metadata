    "description": "The process of levitating and falling,\nIs the process of the soul's elevation,\nA journey towards the heavens,\nOr a descent into manifestation.\n\nWith each rise, the soul ascends,\nIts essence reaching for the divine,\nWhile with each fall, it descends,\nTo experience the earthly confines.\n\nBut through it all, the celestial light,\nGuides the way, shining ever so bright,\nA beacon of hope in times of despair,\nReminding us that our soul's journey is rare.\n\nSo let this artwork be a reminder,\nThat our souls are always in a state of wonder,\nLevitating and falling, rising and descending,\nOn a journey of growth, towards an eternal ending.",
