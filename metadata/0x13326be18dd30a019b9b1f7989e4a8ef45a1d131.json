    "description": "A main subject of my art is the joy of life. My series „Buddhas“ is full of passion and positive energy. I always try to subtly integrate my messages into my works so that the viewer not only experiences visual pleasure, but can also experience a deep personal connection with my works. Overall, my art is intended to be a wonderful embodiment of joy and beauty. With \"Buddhas\" I want to offer a unique perspective on life and invite the viewer to find a deeper connection to the world around us.",
