    "description": "This abstract aerial artwork features a unique circular neighborhood on the outskirt of Copenhagen, Denmark. \n\nThese circular communities were designed by the genius landscape architect Erik Mygind as a place where people can get away from the stresses of apartment living, plant some fruit trees, and relax on the weekend. The typical rent per garden is around $150/month. Due to zoning restrictions, people can only live on the property 6 months out of the year.\n\nThe intention behind this unique layout was to mimic the traditional patterns of the 18th-century Danish villages, where people would use the middle as a focal point for hanging out, mingling, and social interchange between neighbors.\n\n1/1 artwork. \n\nCollector will receive an acrylic signed print for the purchase.\n\nOriginal published on Instagram on June 10, 2019:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/ByiQI_yoI4c",
