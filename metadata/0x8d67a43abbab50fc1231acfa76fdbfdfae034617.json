    "name": "AN ODE TO A REVOLUTIONARY ",
    "description": "1968 Saw the Assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King Jnr, the Murder of Bobby Hutton, the Chicago riots and the Assassination of Robert F Kennedy, Vietnam was still on fire, Nguyen Van Lem was executed in the streets.\n\nIn this violent, painful, death ridden year in the history books was a simple non violent gesture that rattled the world... Tommie Smith and John Carlos, raised their fists in salutation to black power on the podium at the Mexico Olympics. \n\nThis  piece was created to maintain simplicity and to pay homage to the simple but brave and powerful act.\n\nI would like to mention Peter Norman and the role he played in this event too",
