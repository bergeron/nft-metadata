    "description": "Image shot in the winter of 2020 on the Basque Coast in my hometown, Biarritz. \n\nThere is a special type of calmness during a sunrise session in the ocean. The dark water contrasts with the golden light of the rising sun and the only sounds you hear are the waves crashing on shore. You find yourself alone with no one in sight except this surfer enjoying the first light. \n\nTo me, this image encapsulates my favorite visual elements : stunningly golden light, powerful oceans and a surfer facing the elements.\n\nFine art print up to 24 x 36 offered with first collection",
