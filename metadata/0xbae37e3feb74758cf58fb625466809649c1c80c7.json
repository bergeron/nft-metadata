    "description": "In this picture, I tried to convey the range of experienced emotions.\n\n  Night. Explosion. Bright flash of light. Panic and confusion. Fear. Another sleepless night spent in a cold basement. Stupor, fear, anger, adaptation, acceptance and continuation of life in forced conditions. Everyone tries to help in any way they can, the people don't lose heart and find even the slightest reasons for joy, people from all over the world support each other and unite for one goal - peace.\n  The picture was painted in one of the bomb shelters in the village where active hostilities are still going on. The money from the sale of this painting will go to help the Ukrainian army and those in need. ",
