    "description": "Most of my life I live in depression, with pain tearing from the inside, coming from nowhere. This pain has become something familiar, constant, ordinary. My psychologist asked me, \"If this pain were an animal, what would it be? How does it feel?\" I tried to describe it in words, but the best way I can express images and emotions is through art. Now you can see how it feels like. This work is my self-portrait, a self-portrait of my pain. \"Oh, it's you again... Welcome\"",
