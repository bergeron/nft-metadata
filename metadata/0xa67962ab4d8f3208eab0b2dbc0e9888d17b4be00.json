    "description": "In early celebration of our launch on the Ethereum Layer 2 network, Arbitrum Nova, and to celebrate the launch of Sudoswap...\n\nWe give you, the \"pseudo-kraken\", an in-game cosmetic pet that follows your player.\n\nThese pets will render in the MMO open world universe with the Alpha release, if you have one, and you will be able to choose which pet follows you at any given time.\n\nThe pseudo-kraken is known for its telepathy, manipulating crystalline structures to amplify its signals, akin to sonar on steroids. Pseudo-krakens communicate this way, as a hivemind. With their chain of agents dispersed throughout the universe, an ally is never too far.",
