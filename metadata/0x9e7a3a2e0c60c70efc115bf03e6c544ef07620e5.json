    "description": "Out with the morbidity, in with the artistry. Mexico shines on Dia de los Muertos, the day he can be most lively. The death wears candy skull colors. The ones bright enough for him who adores. His lethal scythe acts contrary to his voice. An explosion of colors and life-affirming joys. He despises halloween. Says itâ€™s too depressing to take part in. Dia de los Muertos is more of his game. Symbolizing all the glory to his name\r\n",
