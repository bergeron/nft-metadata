    "description": "AI Artwork created by Mielconejo\n/\nAs part of a bigger collection, WFTB touches on different cultural moments around the world in the themes of magic, spells and folklore, bringing cycles of life, death and witchcraft, spellcraft, language and poetry into different planes of reality. \n\nWFTB brings in and mixes elements of peruvian, mexican, african and japanese folklore to represent souls, esp√≠ritus or onis that cohabitate in our mind, and that can be created by our fears, traumas and expectations of a world shrouded in veils.\n\nThe mix of cultural practices aims to aknowledge the infinite ancestors that live within us, the multiple bloods that build us, the stories that end up building our psyche.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus.",
