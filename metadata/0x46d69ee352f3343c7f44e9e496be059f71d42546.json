    "description": "Dreams were very important to the ancient Egyptians. In ancient Egyptian times, the dream world existed between the land of the living and the world on the other side, a world inhabited by deities and the spirits of the dead. Dreams were communications from those entities. They believed the gods could communicate with you through your dreams. \n\nThe Ancient Egyptians believed so strongly about the power of dreams to foretell the future and offer advice, that they had rituals to incubate their dreams.\n\nWith an NFT the first collector receives an original of physical artwork (100 x 100 cm, acrylic on canvas, rolled in tube).\n\nOn permanent display at the digital part of Louvre, Paris since 2022.\n4575 x 4555 pixels, 300 dpi, jpeg\n\n\n",
