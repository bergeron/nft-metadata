    "description": "Redhood is one of my favorite characters and the reason why I have dropped this image as my launch piece. Redhood is a vital part of the DC Universe in Gotham and a staple for all stories that come from it. Originally the second Robin, Jason was killed by the Joker. Todd was revived via Ra's Al Ghul's Lazarus Pit, and subsequently turned into a more brutal and vicious, but still well-meaning crimefighter. Though he intended to get revenge on Batman for not killing the Joker, he decided not to let it go, and continue crime fighting by becoming a vigilante who kills.\n\n@joeyredhood.22 (IG) featured here, cosplaying as Redhood completely embodies the character and everything that went into creating this costume is superior in detail and weathered to perfection to tell a story of a conflicted person who has returned from the dead.\n\n“If they stand behind you… protect them. If they stand beside you… respect them. If they stand against you… defeat them...”",
