    "description": "I exist to be tested, with my presence and absence. My passions, shame and pleasure originally only belonged to me. \n\nThe gaze was like a weightless water flowing slowly, sticky and warm to the depths of my heart. I quietly waited for it to grow and make more space in me; I watched my own struggle to exist thousands of times like a loser. I laughed at her stubbornness, disappearances when she gave up. Silently, a calm, heavy and serene version of myself emerged from the ashes that grew heavier as I burned. \n\nNeither I nor you could have known what would have happened if a blank farewell were added after the greeting. All of the moments that had been won against the fluid and weightless time, would have turned into an impossibility that destroyed all possibilities in the addressless and undefined depths of eternity.\n\n\nWe were there, weren't we?\n\nNone of the things we needed to share that moment a little more could prove that we did not share that silence and loneliness.\n\n4000 × 6300 px",
