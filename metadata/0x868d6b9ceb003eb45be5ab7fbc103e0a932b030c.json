    "description": "The first Bankless episode on AI… and we went deep down the rabbit hole. \n\nThis conversation with Eliezer Yudkowsky sent us into an existential crisis as we discussed ChatGPT and the new generation of AI, digital super-intelligence, the end of humanity, and if there’s anything we can do to survive.\n\nAccording to Eliezer, we’re already too late. Humanity is doomed. \n\nArtwork generated from the timestamp [59:32-59:51] Nobody knows how to create any good AIs at all. The problem isn’t that we have 20 good AIs and that somebody finally builds an evil AI. The problem is that the first powerful AI is evil, nobody knows how to make it good, and then it kills everybody before anybody can make it good.” \n\n10% of proceeds donated to Eliezer's MIRI Foundation.",
