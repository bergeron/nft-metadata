    "description": "We are a sweet song,  \nA ballad written on the shoulders of the royalty we come from,  \nA poem carved from harmonies that ride on the rising and falling of the cries of our conquests,   \nWe write our destinies and carry them on our heads.  \nWe speak a tongue that defies logic,  \nWe call on the rain and it hearkens, we spin healing from mere plants,  \nChildren of the soil, an imagery of the ancestors,   \nWe are a reincarnation of gods.",
