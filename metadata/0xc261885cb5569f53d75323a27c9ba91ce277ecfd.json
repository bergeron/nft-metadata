    "description": "Texture is important. Without texture, people will only see what is on your surface. I don't mean texture in the\ntraditional sense. I mean texture as an abstract concept. What do people see when they look at you, when they talk\nto you, when they interact with you?\nWhen painting your canvas, express yourself, allow people to see past the surface, to see the love you have within,\nthe pain that has shaped you. You are the only thing you own entirely, so embrace that fact and never undersell yourself.",
