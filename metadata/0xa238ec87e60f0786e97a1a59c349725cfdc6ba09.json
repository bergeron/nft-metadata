    "description": "In the early 1970s, Playboy asked Salvador Dal√≠ to conceptualize his erotic fantasies, then dispatched staff photographer Pompeo Posar to Dal√≠‚Äôs Mediterranean villa in the Spanish village of Cadaqu√©s to help the artist bring them to life. The images, which appeared in a December 1974 pictorial called \"The Erotic World of Salvador Dal√≠,\" are a series of off-the-wall photographic surrealities depicting everything from swans and serpents to an oversized egg etched with Playboy‚Äôs Rabbit Head logo.\n\nThe ‚ÄúSurrealist Visions‚Äù Rabbitar Hare Drop features two original images from the unforgettable pictorial, straight from the Playboy Archives. One of the images, or, \"Hare-itage Artifacts,\" was hare-dropped to all Rabbitars with the ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs Paintbrush‚Äù trait. Only 227 editions of the original image will ever be minted. The second Hare-itage Artifact was distributed exclusively to the hodler of the Dal√≠-inspired 1/1, \"Study in Surrealism.\" Only one edition of the original image will ever be minted. \n\nThe distribution breakdown of Hare Drop 002 is as follows:\n\nHare Drop 002: Surrealist Visions - The Erotic World of Salvador Dal√≠, 1974, BTS of Egg (Edition of 227) --> 227 tokens distributed on an ERC1155 contract\n\nHare Drop 002: Surrealist Visions - The Erotic World of Salvador Dal√≠, 1974, BTS of Artist (Edition of 1) --< 1/1 token distributed on an ERC721 contract\n\n\nü•ö+üêç+üêá+‚úåÔ∏è",
