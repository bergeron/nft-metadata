    "description": "The definitions of words evolve over time as the world changes around them. In the online space, following is almost a transaction. But what if we took back the old meaning of just coming along with someone on their journey?Â \n\nThis conceptual composite photograph and self-portrait is what I consider to be the beginning of my career as an artist in 2013. In creating \"Please Follow\", I deliberately chose to go into the unknown and follow my calling, and as an artist I ask the viewer to follow me into the wonderland of dreams.\n\nCreated with a Canon 5D MkII and Adobe Photoshop.",
