    "description": "Cover of my first album Imaginary Orders.\n\nThe album is named Imaginary Orders as a reminder that nothing can stop us from being who we want to be. Embracing our true selves. Following our passions. Re-inventing ourselves as often as we want. There is no higher power writing our future, but only social narratives stopping us from creating it.\n\nWe can overcome these narratives by doing. To reach a state of perpetual movements. Evolving as a person, changing our opinions, and testing new approaches are part of the cyclic nature of life itself.\n\nThe order that governs our life exists only in our imagination. Once we have decided to stop believing our myths then we can start expressing a new version of ourselves.\n\n**Stream Imaginary Orders**\nhttps://artists.landr.com/billhades\n\n**Album credits** \nProduced, Written and performed by Bill & Hades\nMixed and Mastered by Tim Rees\nAlbum Cover by Alexandre Rochet",
