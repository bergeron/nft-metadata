    "description": "Every second, more animals are being hunted in Africa that has got a new label these days- a kind of sport, which is utter cruelty. Those trophy hunters do so for the sake of entertainment posing in front of the camera next to the dead body of a creature who had the right to live like all of us.  \nHow can we justify these actions?  \nCan you even imagine killing a beautiful rhino and taking its life just for hanging its horn on the wall of our house?  \nWhere has our humanity gone?  \nWho are the real savages?  \nHumans or animals?",
