    "description": "Description: The only way the 5,500 artists of Edge Island can defend their island home from vicious attack is to find the Eyeris and draw from its infinite creative power. Some artists use their powers to control and destroy, while others use their powers to defend everything and everyone they love. A war is coming and whatever side your artist is on, one thing is certain, you won’t survive unless you level up... A.O.T.E. (Artist Of The Eyeris) is a collection of 5,500 NFT’s on the Polygon platform. These NFTs are based on the manga series characters written and illustrated by artist and A.O.T.E. founder Cory Evans. As an NFT holder, you join an exclusive artist collective that has one simple aim: to bring notoriety and profitability to artists while expanding the A.O.T.E. IP and community.",
