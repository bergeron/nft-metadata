    "description": "In these series of draeings,   which were formed by using a kind of holy doodling method , I applied some sort of Improvised lines . Them completed them by adding purposely more detaied lines.\nThese portraits were created while I managed to connect with my inner state to form a doodle artwork. \nI tried to experience a state , similar to meditation,  and tend the people who confront my artworks to consider themselves,  staying away daily tensional life .\nI used the symbols like DNA and heart and vibration and lines, because I think ,they can show a better situation of our mind. \nAnd I like ,when you look at these artworks,  you also have a journey into your subconscious.",
