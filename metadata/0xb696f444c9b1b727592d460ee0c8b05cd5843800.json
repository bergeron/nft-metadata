    "description": "This Non-Failable Token of Appreciation was generated by Ben Currier using the AI Artwork platform Midjourney and was subsequently edited in Photoshop.\n\nHowever, I wanted to do more than hand out a picture of a trophy. I wanted to create a token of appreciation that would theoretically last forever.\n\nBy turning this award into an NFT with the added credibility and security of the blockchain, thereâ€™s an extra layer of verification showing lasting proof of their undeniable achievement.\n\nEvery one of these trophies represents a person who is special to me. I highly recommend you check out what these people have done and continue to do in their creative journeys.",
