    "description": "Introducing the fourth artist featured via our hedSOLO drops: Max Fry. A real OG in the community since hedsTAPE 02, Max has shown what it means to be a hed and has been on 9 different hedsTAPE's. We are stoked to on-board him to sound with \"Zomba\", an ethereal instrumental that encapsulates Max's melodic sound.\n\nA quote from Max about the song...\n\n\"Zomba serves as a symbol of my experience with heds. The forward thinking community has allowed me to make raw expressive music outside the constructs of genres, rules, and overthinking, reaching true artistic freedom. Listening to Zomba will give you a glimpse of my headspace in the moments of its creation.\"\n\nLook forward to more hedSOLO drops every month via the heds community, exclusively on Sound.",
