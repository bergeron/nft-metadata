    "description": "Presenting a fun original art piece depicting the life story of the city of Los Angeles (Version 3). A great purchase or gift for anyone who loves this creative, eclectic, and vibrant city of angels...\n\nHand-drawn digital illustration with a somewhat isometric art approach; like that of a video game mixed with \"Where’s Waldo?” \n\nOne of the goals with this art piece is for viewers to discover something new each time they look at it… a lot of hidden gems and unique elements that help tell the life story/history of the City of Angels and capture its quirkiness. L.A. is incredibly spread out so it was also fun and a bit challenging to condense everything into one frame. \n\nSince Sagen.Life specializes in telling life stories, important years can be seen on or next to each iconic landmark, key location, and important moment in the city's history from 1850 to present day.\n\nIdeal for collectors of one-of-a-kind Los Angeles memorabilia or anyone interested in leveraging the piece as a business opportunity. Owning this special piece will allow you to sell prints at scale to both B2B (museums, airports, government buildings, cultural centers) and B2C (those who love LA and art) customers. Also ideal to be positioned as a housewarming or going away gift.\n\nThis art piece was proudly produced in the heart of the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, CA.",
