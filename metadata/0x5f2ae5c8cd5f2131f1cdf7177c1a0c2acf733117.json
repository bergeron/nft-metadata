    "description": "There is nothing better than walking into an abandoned place to find remnants of the past. The precious junk I find tells the story of what once was. As I walked into this particular home, it was mostly empty except for the TV, and it was so cute. As I started shooting, I quickly became enthralled with the crack in the wall behind it, something that an average person may have overlooked. But I am an explorer of history and decay, and it is tiny delights like these, that make my day.",
