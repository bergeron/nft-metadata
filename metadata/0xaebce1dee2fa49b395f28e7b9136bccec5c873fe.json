    "description": "Hello guys, I am from Turkey. As you know, we experienced two earthquakes, one was magnitude of 7.5 and the other was magnitude of 7.8. \nIn this collection, I wanted to tell you in a simple way what we experienced, felt, tried to do, needed, realized and hoped during and after the earthquake with some words. \nDo not forget that all the people can face with natural disasters, they can happen in any country. Do not underestimate it.  \nI wanted to raise the awareness of all of us and to express my feelings as a country's citizen that experienced a terrible earthquake, as someone who lost loved ones in the earthquake.",
