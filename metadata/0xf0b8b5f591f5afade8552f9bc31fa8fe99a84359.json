    "description": "The Bus Stop\n\n✤ ✤ ✤\n\nIt's about love, about her, about us, about you and about time. It's about a journey, a visual story. She's a poppy. She's rooted in me.\n\n\"Through the blue summer days, I shall travel all the ways,\nPricked by the ears of maize, trampling the dew:\nA dreamer, I will gaze, as underfoot the coolness plays.\nI’ll let the evening breeze drench my head anew.\"\nA.R.\n\n✤ ✤ ✤\n\nArtwork & music composition by Mannay (2023)",
