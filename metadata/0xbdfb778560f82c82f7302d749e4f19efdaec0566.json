    "description": "As the Hypatia Network team, we would like to announce our \"Hypatia Charity Check\" NFT project.\n\nOn February 6, 2023 a major earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck southern Turkey and northwest Syria, killing hundreds of people as buildings collapsed across the snowy region, triggering a search for survivors trapped in rubble.\n\nIt's so sad to wake up to news like that. Our hearth goes with all those affected.\n\nThis NFT piece is designed for all heroes who want to lend a helping hand. All unknown heroes who mint NFT in the ''Hypatia Charity Check'' project will be entitled to free mint whitelist for Hypatia Network's exclusive project \"Hypatia Friendship Stamps\".\n\nWe would like to thank all our heroes who supported the ''Hypatia Charity Check'' project from the bottom of our hearts. üôè\n\nAll proceeds from this sale will be %100 donated to AHBAP, trying to bring help and hope to effected areas. Check out their website  \nhttps://ahbap.org/  \nand twitter page for more info  \nhttps://twitter.com/ahbap",
