    "description": "Cai Beo is a Vietnamese floating village nestled in the most important archaeological site of Cat Ba Island, dating back almost 7.000 years. Found in the depths of karst formations, it brings together some 300 families living from fishing and fish farming. After traveling to the heart of the island, I realised that Cai Beo is a must-see stop to enjoy the authentic life of generations that have settled in mobile homes for centuries.\n\n1/1 NFT by 9426  \nExtended Editorial License",
