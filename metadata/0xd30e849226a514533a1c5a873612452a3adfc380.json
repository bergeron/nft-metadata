    "description": "Lost Memory is a soulful and AI-generated series. The images are frames of an intimate state of profound solitude, the loss of memory and awareness of one's identity, the crumbling of memories, of affections, of everything that has built us as a person. The face, map of our life, is confused, dissolved, incomprehensible, the party dress becomes a grotesque and tender mask, the places are the expression of an interiority that walks in oblivion. Loosely inspired by Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach and my own life.",
