    "description": "A lot of the time I feel like I have to live at least double life. \n\nA lot like the show Mr Robot, where the main character Elliot has multiple personalities, I feel as though there are multiple versions of myself who swap places depending on the situations which I face. Theres the side my friends see, the side my family sees, the side the creatives see, the side my girlfriend sees, and the internal side of me, all fighting for control of 'me'\n\nThis tears me apart sometimes and is pretty unbearable to deal with especially since they're all so different at least in my opinion.\n\nBut which me gives this opinion? Who Knows? i for sure don't.\n\nAll I know for sure is I HateTheRealMe",
