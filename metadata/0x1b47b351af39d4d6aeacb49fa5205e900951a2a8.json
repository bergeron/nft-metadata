    "description": "'Hippie Killer' is a character inspired by an infamous serial murderer of the early 70's. The blood splatter on the glasses and stoned, dead eyes are a contrast to the charming innocence of his face. He is the first to go up on the Hall of Notoriety collection among many others to follow. The owner of the NFT will get posted a 4k wallpaper collectible. ",
