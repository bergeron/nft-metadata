    "description": "Tangle: Are you your pure self or your ego self? How do you know if your desires are destined?\n\nUntangled: When you surrender your ego self, trusting that you are Divinely guided and protected, the heart starts to heal from all the worldly influences: traumas and experiences. When the heart heals, the inner child heals which brings you closer to your true and higher self. \n\nThe fire of Desire that ignites is now the one that is Divine and Destined. It comes from your true self and not ego self. It is pure desire that you were fated to pursue as a soul purpose.\n\nKnot 1 : Untangled",
