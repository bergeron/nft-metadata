    "description": "Crossings is a series of images depicting cities from a fixed position above common intersections which can be tiled together to create a quilted view of each place. In the Venice series, the intersections of the canals and their bridges create a stark contrast from the previously released Houston series, which depicts a city with a much more rigid cartesian grid.\n\nDrawing inspiration from photographers such as Bernd and Hilla Becher (and many of those that studied under them), Peterâ€™s work aims to create a typological view of the urban condition of various cities as seen from the sky. By making use of newly available technologies, such as multi-rotor copters and satellite imagery for research, Peter is able to provide a visual commentary on the unique condition of each city, thereby creating a dialog between them. \n\nMore information on the project can be found at https://www.petermolick.com/crossings.\n\nCrossings (Venice) No. 25/25, 2016. 3540 x 3540px. \npetermolick.com",
