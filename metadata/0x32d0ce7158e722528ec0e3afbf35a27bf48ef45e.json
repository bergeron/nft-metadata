An illustration by CryptoPOM, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe collector of this 1/1 (on the primary market) will have the privilege of their own real-life pet becoming the \"official\" house pet for the Not Guilty band in their dorm. That means that your pet will appear, not just in the first episode, but in EVERY episode set in the Not Guilty dorm. Theoretically, this pet could also be based on an animal pfp, within reason. CryptoPOM will be in touch to discuss your pet/pfp's personality and appearance. If you are the winner of this auction, please DM @cryptopom1 on Twitter to discuss your reward.\n",
