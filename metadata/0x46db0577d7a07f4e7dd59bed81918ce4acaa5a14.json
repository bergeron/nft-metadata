    "description": "GROWTH NETWORK\nDIFFERENTIAL GROWTH\nGENERATIVE ALGORITHMS\n\nMy practice focus's on the development of system orientated design and mimics naturally occurring processes. This explores the diverse patterns of representation and identity we share in our community and local environments.\n\nIt also reflects on ways \"systems\" determine how we live and what we believe in. A system is not just a physical mechanism but also an abstract ideology. This artwork points to the forms and instruments that make up our technological infrastructure, as well as the values they are designed to enforce. Contesting a world that rewards efficiency, speed, and productivity, the artworks below represents differential growth a system that has rewarded nature for centuries.",
