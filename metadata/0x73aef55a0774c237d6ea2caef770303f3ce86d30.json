    "description": "There are few things as immediately recognizable as a stick figure. These stick figs are a part of the Stykmin Society, a collection of 10,000 procedurally generated stick figure NFTs using the Ethereum blockchain. Each Stykmin is generated from a list of 195 unique traits, and can have as few as 3 or as many as 9. The traits vary in rarity, and while some are cooler than others, each Stykmin is awesome in its own way.",
