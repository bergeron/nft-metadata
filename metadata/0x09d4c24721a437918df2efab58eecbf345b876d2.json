    "description": "In every country, the rooster has its own symbolic meaning, and here it is also a symbol of dawn and blessing, and on the other hand, the rooster has its own charms, apart from its beauty, wings and feathers, its strong chest and its powerful legs, which give a good feeling in the work. It exists and in their life they take care of the family, which is somewhat similar to human life, and I like to show these similarities to people's lives.",
