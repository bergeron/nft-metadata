    "description": "I live my life in parallel. I exist in two worlds, side by side, in different forms. \nOn earth, I am bound by physics and limited by time, but in the metaverse, I exist on my terms.\n\nIn the real world, I am confined by my body and every action has consequences; positive and negative. In the metaverse, I am limitless and wild. A hologram, a being of pure light and mind. I can exist when I choose to exist. \n\nDuality; the new reality. Where our actions in one world affect our lives in the other world. How will you choose to live your life? How will you be known? How will you be remembered?\n\n",
