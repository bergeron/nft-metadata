    "name": "The Koi ballet",
    "description": "Digital image of an #original painting created by the artist Lu√≠s Bastos.\n\n\"The Koi Ballet\" was inspired by the #harmony and #visual surroundings drawn from observing the movements coming from #nature, an activity that is a source for the #artist to drink from, and essentially serves as a #concept for the elevation to #abstract thought. In the imagery, lakes and ponds, perhaps around Mount Fuji, are home to trout and #Koi fish, and their ballets are living spectacles, a #delight to the #mind. Work executed with synthetic enamel on an acrylic background.\n\nNote: Physical piece already sold and not available to purchase through the artist selling channels.",
