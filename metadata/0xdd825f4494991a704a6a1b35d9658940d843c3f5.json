    "description": "Torso was inspired by the damaged ancient Greek sculptures and the final scene of the Japanese animation “Ghost in the Shell” theater edition. The new vision found among the destroyed bodies has been transformed into a series of works, by colliding with different elements.\n\nYunsung Lee is interested in the expressions of old narrative and modern visual culture. He uses images produced by famous narratives-Western myths-as motifs, and expression methods derived from subculture images called Manga or Moe. He utilizes this methodology not only for the subject and form of the painting but also for the shape, size, and combination method of the frame, as well as color and drawing techniques.",
