    "description": "Rivendell. This valley is where J.J. Tolkien has imagined the valley which represents both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical Elvish otherworld.\nIn 1911 the master visited this valley in Switzerland, and in 1937 he drew a painting of the well-known valley. The beginning of the magical world of LOTR is here and this is my humble tribute to his genius vision, in an autumnal dress.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
