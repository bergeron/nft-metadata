    "description": "This artwork was created for the exhibition \"I am...\" powered by Gxrls Revolution and Jean-Michel Pailhon.\n\nLA PLACE DE LA FEMME EST DANS LA BLOCKCHAIN” is an AI 3D collage. I have combined my 3D collage technique with layers of AI imagery using prompts trained on my own style and practice. \n\nThe artwork takes the viewer on a journey, starting off with what appears to be a traditional collage. As the collage starts to dis-integrate, the concept of a woman’s identity in web3 starts to reveal itself, through the 3D layers and graffiti. This leads round to a techno futuristic plane where the central female figure is replaced by a beautiful metallic AI robot and the notion that a woman’s traditional place will no longer be in the home or kitchen. It will be in the blockchain. \n\nThis message is re-iterated as we finish our journey with the graffiti words “equality is decentralized”. \n\nI truly believe that women’s empowerment and freedom will come from decentralization.",
