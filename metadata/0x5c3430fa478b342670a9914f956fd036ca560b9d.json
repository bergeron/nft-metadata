    "description": "Prologue â… . \n\nThe Journey.\nSounds exciting. Like something that is separate from the whole routine. Something worth waiting for and preparing for.\nHow much do you have to earn to go on a journey? How many steps, kilometers, miles does it take to be considered a journey?\n\nI thought - what if we're all on the way already?\nA few years of wandering or a walk under an umbrella on a summer evening can equally change lives once and for all.\nIt's as if time and space don't matter that much.\nIt seems the way is not a plane ticket or dust beneath our feet. Rather, it is the faces of the people we meet, the thoughts that come to us, the love without language barriers or the borders of countries and regions.\n\nI have just realized that this work is a journey from the 21st century to the 19th and back again, from impressionism to digital art, bypassing thousands of kilometers and differences in languages.\nAnd I don't know if that's a lot or a little.\n\nSo, \"Sunset meadow\", inspired by Claude Monet.",
