    "description": "as a young(er) kid i always had a hard time expressing myself verbally.  trying to articulate my thoughts felt like an impossible task.  i never had an appropriate or effective medium for expression.  i knew that music spoke to me.  i distinctly remember at the age of 8 my sister putting on a song about a man on his deathbed.  i couldn’t fully grasp the weight of what the singer was saying, but i felt the emotion in his voice and especially in the instrumental.  that’s when it clicked for me.  music is a universal language.  \n\ntwo years later i went to the movies with my family.  we watched Tron Legacy.  as a kid, i loved all the action and visual effects, but what really stuck with me was the soundtrack.  i hadn’t heard anything like it up to that point.  i was hooked.  from there, diving into daft punk, deadmau5, skrillex, porter robinson and many others, it was only a matter of time before i arrived at the realization that there were infinite possible ways to express oneself sonically by using just a laptop and some headphones.  the rest is history, as they say.  i’ve been using music as my primary form of expression for 10 years now.  every song i write is a personal challenge, emotionally and technically.  a welcomed one.  it’s been indescribably cathartic to get to a place where other people care about and can relate to what i have to say through my music.  i’m very thankful that anybody listens at all and i’m very excited for the journey ahead.  \n\nwolf is about being lied to.  wether it be your partner, parents, a friend, politicians, \nor “society” as a whole, we’ve all been lied to.  i grew up pretty sheltered.  my parents tried their best to shield me from the harsh realities of life.  i had no idea how bad things could get, and surely i’m still ignorant of how fucked up things can become.  my parents divorce was ugly.  my parents aren’t bad people, but they both showed their true colors in many regards.  i quickly started to become aware of the flaws both of them kept from me through every step of my upbringing.  when those you trusted and held in such high regard morally turn out to be no better than you in their own ways, it calls a lot of things into question.  this is what it feels like.",
