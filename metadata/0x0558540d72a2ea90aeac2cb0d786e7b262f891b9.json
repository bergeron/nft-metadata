    "description": "Amber Vittoria’s abstracted work draws on her relationship to femininity, emotion, and identity. This is a 1/1 where the primary collector receives the physical 11 x 14\" painting. The poem for this piece is: “Solid Compositions” / Have negative space, / So when a bad thought / Appears, give yourself grace. The artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artist Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.",
