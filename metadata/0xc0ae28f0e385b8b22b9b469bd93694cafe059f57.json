    "description": "Pamiee himself with Decora Style\nThis bring back so much memories of my friend that passed away last year, she lost at the age of 19 in 2021. She loves Lolita & Decora, we usually dress as Decora girl at the cosplay convention together. I usually borrow the accessories from her. There was a fight between us and we stop talking to each other for 3 years,  then what happen is my friend told me that she just passed away. But during the pandemic, no one can make it to visit her funeral. I tried my best to sneak out to visit her funeral, It was sad,  the funeral was cold because there are no one there visit her due to Covid. But i think that she would be happy knowing that i came to her funeral.\nCanvas size: 2000*2500",
