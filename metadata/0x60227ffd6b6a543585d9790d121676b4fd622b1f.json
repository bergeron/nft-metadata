    "description": "I saw this passage at the front gates of Taj Mahal in India. I waited there a little bit and made my composition before. Then a pregnant woman came by with matching colors on her dress. I just asked if I can get a picture with her because everything looks perfect to shoot. She just smiled and gave me permission. This is how I shoot one of my favorite photos from India.\n\nPhotographer: Masis Usenmez\nBio: EFIAP honored, award-winning Armenian origin Turkish street and documentary photographer based in France.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
