    "description": "Just Until We're Gone: Genesis |||\n\nArtwork for the first story collected in Volume One: This Big World of Bloo.\n\nQuite a bit of technology and time has gone into the presentation of this little story, and this is just one frac tion of a whole.\n\nThe base sketch was done by my mother, on paper, kindly (and swiftly) upon my request, based on this old story of mine. She then (I believe) snapped a photo of that on her phone, and e-mailed it to me.\n\nI like how she titled that JP[Îž]G:\n\n\"The girl in the window\"\n\nI added color via Adobe Fresco on my iPad (iOS), then added subtle motion effects via Photoshop on my computer (Windows OS). I also added music I made years ago, which has its own story.\n\nThe final filename is \"just-until-we-re-gone\" and it is more than just a JPEG (it's an MP4, see).\n\nI typically use all of the characters available to me. As per, I have used 1000/1000 here.\n\nStart reading here, while the pages remain [just until they're gone]: https://oncyber.io/volume-one\n\n- vvveary",
