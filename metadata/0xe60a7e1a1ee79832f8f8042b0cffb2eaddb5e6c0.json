    "description": "This was SBF’s final public appearance before the collapse of FTX.\n\nHe was fighting to make DeFi permissioned. To make it closed and appease the regulators.\n\nErik was defending the grounds that this industry was founded on — an open, credibly neutral, permissionless financial system for the world.\n\nThis is a legendary debate between two giants on their views about the future of crypto.\n\nArtwork generated from timestamp - 1:12:43 - 1:13:04 - when Erik asks SBF the difference between DeFi and email. \n\n100% of ALL proceeds go to CoinCenter to help fight for thoughtful regulation of DeFi.",
