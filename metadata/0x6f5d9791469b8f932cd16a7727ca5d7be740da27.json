Deep in notches and curves something stays consistent. \nRage exists. \nDarkness exists. \nDoubts exist. \nFear exists. \nThoughts which try to pull you backwards exist.\n\n\nHowever, HOPE … is what makes you put a hand on your heart and gives you the courage to move ahead towards the light … \nto new beginnings … \nto the future … \nto further and beyond ...  \n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nThe artwork is created using a self photograph taken a year back and is a reflection of that very phase of my life.\n\n\nImage : 6000 X 9000 pixels @ 600ppi.",
