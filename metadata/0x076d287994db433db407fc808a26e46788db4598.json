    "description": "The sky symbolises transcendence, eternity and infinity. Would I to launch from the art into the sky, I would explode into boundless space as we know it, or rather, do not know it. The sky above is constantly moving as its various shapes and tones appear, evolve and disappear. The special transcendental quality of clouds comes from the dichotomy of their appearance â€“ they appear in solid form to the human eye but are also formless and cannot be contained. I explored this contradiction in this painting.",
