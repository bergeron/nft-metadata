    "description": "What up I'm Jamee Cornelia based out of Atlanta [eastside] by way of Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina. I'm a Experimental visual artist and Alternative Rapper known for their uniqueness, high energy and creativity. \n\nPulling from Punk and Pop influences like Beyonce to M.I.A to Queens of the Stone Age to Jay Z to Pink Floyd to Britney Spears. As well as Hip Hop/Trap influences like Gucci Mane Busta Rhymes Missy Elliot and Ludacris. I am a mixed bag of sounds and aesthetics that enjoys keeping their audience guessing. \n\nThis track is a high energy song celebrating authenticity. I highlight the duality of living in spaces that aren't consider righteous while being exactly aligned with my purpose.  Heavily inspired by Pep Rallies and \"bullying\" the opposition.\n\nThis song is produced by Kanpekibeats fellow Mind Vomit Collective member.  Graphics done by myself and my wife.\n\n",
