    "description": "This body of work was born out of my time wandering solo in Joshua Tree National Park. The multi-layered images reflect the multi-faceted world in which we live and our relationship to it. There is not only many layers of plant life but also many layers including: my perception of the space, my emotions in relationship to my perception of the space, the other humans in the area (if any), the location of the sun, the location of the planets, the barometric pressure of the air, and how I am recording and capturing this exact moment in time.\n\nIt is my hope that regardless of your connection to nature these images will visually draw you into the mystery that the natural world around us holds and perhaps sometime in the future you may find yourself listening to the wind, talking to a tree or simply feeling what the world around you possesses.\n\nThis piece I captured after emerging from the wilderness. I was approaching camp and was enamored by this raven soaring high in the desert winds.\n ",
