    "description": "*\"Desperately searching for something you are certain exists, yet it cannot be seen. It is a burden you, alone, must carry.\"*  \n\nA digital collage by multidisciplinary fine artist, Amalia Versaci. Collage elements are digital photographs taken by the artist, as well as photos of mixed media work on paper, also created by the artist. The final composition is created, and manipulated, digitally. \n\nThe technique is a confluence of the artist's passions for creating both physical and digital art. It creates a unique image, which could not be created using either format alone.",
