    "description": "In 2014 Joseph Leflore gained viral fame after sharing a Vine video of himself and his little brother singing \"Ohmygod\". Unbeknownst to many, this popular sound had actually originated when Joseph was playing the well-known video game Call of Duty. When his character died, rather than cursing, he sang out \"Oh my god, I died.\" The next day, he and his brother recorded a Vine video, where Joseph redid the sound and his brother was instructed to look delighted.
