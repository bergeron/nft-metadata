    "description": "---\n\n#### The fallen saint.\n\nA monk and a fallen ruler who had appeared 1,000 years ago amid the chaotic times nearing the end of the Silla Dynasty. While everyone wished to become a king, he dared to become a god. His overrated self belief and intense disbelief towards the world led to his downfall. It was his imperfect insight into the universe that led him to his fall, but the stroke opens up new possibilities for his fate.",
