    "description": "Being your self is losing your soul during the way to find it out again... it is falling a thousand times and getting up from every obstacle, from every mistake. It is learning from your fails, cause there you may find what your looking for, is curiosity, is never ending energy. It is going down to hell over and over and it is burning inside in the search but always rising from the ashes like a Phoenix.\n\nReal handmade artwork made out of white organic papercrafts layers that burns on a red light mergind into a new artwork giving life to Burning soul.
