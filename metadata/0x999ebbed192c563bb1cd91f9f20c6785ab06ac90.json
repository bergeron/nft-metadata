    "description": "RK VISUAL EXHIBITION TAIPEI 2022\n\"FROM DUST TILL DAWN\"\n\nFrom sunset to dawn.\nIf this COVID-19 pandemic is sunset, the message is to hope that the dawn will come soon and that the usual daily life will return soon.\n\nAll the photographs in this solo exhibition are from Tokyo. These are all photos of Tokyo that I took in this COVID-19 pandemic, including past works.\n\nAbout two years have passed since then, and when I forgot about those photos, I got to hear about this solo exhibition project in Taipei, and it was these photos that I immediately remembered.\n\nThis time, I will hold an auction of one-of-a-kind item on Foundation, and I also tried something new to the work. In addition, the buyer will have this special privilege that I go to any country and take photos for you.",
