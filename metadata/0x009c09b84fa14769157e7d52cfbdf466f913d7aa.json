    "description": "A collection exploring some possible Great Filters of the Fermi Paradox.\n\nAs this civilization entered its technology area.  More and more power and information cables where set up around the planet.  This coil of cable can interact with magnetic objects like the sun.  With a large and unluckily directed coronal mass ejection. magnetically interacted and created a massive current that ran through the network, destroying every device on the power grid. Without communications production and transportation the civilization fell rapidly and was never able to recover. Stars may not be as stable over long times as we have though a coronal mass ejection could be in our future as well.",
