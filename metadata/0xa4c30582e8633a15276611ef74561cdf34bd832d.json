    "description": "She watched from a top-floor balcony as the morning commute trotted in and out of the metro entrance on the quiet avenue below. \n\nSome passed without notice, but others felt a gravitational urge to gaze upwards. \n\nThe creamy art deco façade. The blue sky reflected in the windows. That brilliant and bold red dress.\n\nHer presence felt unreal... like a dream or a scene from classic cinema. But this was no dream - this was her reality. A queen in her element.\n\nLa haute reine en rouge.\n\n•••\n\n50% of sale proceeds will be donated to The Collective Identity. An LA-based a non-profit charity which supports black women with mentorship programs.  (https://www.thecollectiveidentity.org/)",
