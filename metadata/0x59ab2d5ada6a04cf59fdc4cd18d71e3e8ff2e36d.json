    "description": "\"For example, some research has suggested that fungi called ergot alkaloids, which are produced by certain species of fungi, can cause hallucinations and other changes in brain function.\n\nThere is also some evidence that certain fungi can produce compounds that can affect the immune system, which in turn can affect brain function. For example, some research has suggested that certain fungi may have anti-inflammatory effects, which could potentially be beneficial for certain brain disorders.\"",
