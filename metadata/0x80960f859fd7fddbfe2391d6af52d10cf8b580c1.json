    "description": "My series, Minutemen, is a pseudo portrait of armed U.S. civilian groups patrolling the Arizona/Mexico border that participate as volunteer, trained vigilantes. Faded from the heat and sun of the Sonoran Desert, the empty shells were collected from sites located through Minutemen web social networks. At the time, this project represented my desire to tell a story about social phenomena within the landscape and threaded to my larger body of work. Completed in 2011, this piece is part of a collection of 30 and has exhibited widely.",
