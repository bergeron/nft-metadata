    "description": "Verse 1:\nIn a world of darkness and chaos,\nWhere heroes are hard to find,\nThere are those who still stand tall,\nWith courage that shines like a light.\n\nChorus:\nHidden heroes, in the shadows they stand,\nDefying the odds, with a heart full of grace.\nIn a world of turmoil and strife,\nTheir bravery shines like a beacon of life.\n\nVerse 2:\nThey may not wear a cape or a crown,\nBut their actions speak louder than words.\nWith their deeds they lift up the fallen,\nAnd bring hope to the masses unheard.\n\nChorus:\nHidden heroes, in the shadows they stand,\nDefying the odds, with a heart full of grace.\nIn a world of turmoil and strife,\nTheir bravery shines like a beacon of life.\n\nBridge:\nTheir stories may go untold,\nBut their impact cannot be erased.\nFor the lives they touch, the love they show,\nWill forever be a testament to their faith.\n\nOutro:\nLet us remember the hidden heroes,\nThe unsung champions of the light.\nFor in a world of darkness and disorder,\nThey are the ones who bring hope and light.",
