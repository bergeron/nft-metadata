    "description": "Society revolves around one factor, growth. In order to have growth one needs to inject capital. Own that capital and you own the direction of that growth. The crypto space has generated a myriad of new fortunate and rich individuals  with their own set of interests. \n\n\n\nThe evolution of industries and projects will depend on the interests of these individuals. After the digital revolution, will there still be an interest for human philanthropy? Or will it be all about digital capital? Middle-class workers turned Sultans through their diamond hands might have a change in ethos and principles when faced with their new riches. These will be the patrons of the next digital revolution. \n\nFrom the Ethereum Index Company ",
