    "description": "HEART ON MY SLEEVE THEY CALL DIS DRIP..\n\nLumenville presents \"DEAD MON WALKING\"\n\nThis music visual / film was directed by my favourite production team, Lumenville. It depicts the beginning of a story and project called “132 Nights” that follows my journey after summer towards the fall, symbolizing brighter days transitioning into shorter, darker nights.\n\nDead Mon Walking showcases the struggle and entrapment of my own troubles, trying my best to stay afloat within my environment and ensure my own survival. 132 is a very special number to me because it’s actually the number of days between my previous project “96’ Summers” in June and Oct. 30th (my grandpa’s birthday) when I dropped 132 Nights. This genesis NFT will be the beginning of our visual / film community, music in media, & creating something special to connect more with supporters in the web3.
