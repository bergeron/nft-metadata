    "description": "In 1995 I had the opportunity to spend a year in Croix-des-Bouquets Haiti (a village east of the capital Port-au-Prince), where I became fluent in Creole. Speaking the language added to a deep connection with the culture and people—a beautiful and rich experience I've been privileged to enjoy. \n\nSince returning home to Canada, I have visited Haiti numerous times to explore, reacquaint and visit friends. \n\nThese photos document those experiences and encounters.",
