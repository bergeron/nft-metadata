    "description": "Inspiring on and off-screen, Leonardo DiCaprio has been making waves in the Climate Change movement over the past years. The actor who has played a leading man and a hero in various movie projects had also proven to be a protagonist for the planet's welfare in real life, with his support for environmental causes stretching far back into 1998 where he founded Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a non-profit organization whose purpose is to protect all wildlife across the globe. But unlike the sole hero in a critically-acclaimed drama, Leonardo is no lone wolf in the cause. He actively supports other environmental organizations, recognizing that the fight against global warming, takes a communityâ€”it takes everyone. And while DiCaprio has received notable praise for his efforts, he hardly does it for the proverbial pat on the shoulder. Indeed, Leonardo DiCaprio is an icon worthy of our admiration and appreciation.",
