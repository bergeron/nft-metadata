    "description": "On November 8, 2022, a total Lunar Eclipse occurred.  I had photographed many lunar eclipses before but had never done a wide-field composite to my liking.  My initial idea was to just get the composite shots and a landscape, but when the car drove by, I decided to get some light trails to add to the scene.  I'm glad I did, because it added interest and some leading lines in the composition.  The base shot was taken at blue-hour as the eclipsed moon was setting.  \n\nPhotographer: Jason Betzner\n\nCollection: Lunar\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLocation: Williamsburg, Virginia, USA\n\nYear Created: 2022\n\nGenre: Astrophotography\n\nGear: Canon EOS 6D, Canon EF 20mm f 2.8 \n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
