    "description": "In 2014, residents of Flint, Michigan, began noticing that their water tasted bad, smelled foul, and came out of the tap discolored. The city had switched water supplies to save money, and in the process, the city and state failed to add anti-corrosion chemicals to the new supply. \n\nFlint’s aging pipes began to poison its residents. \n\nIn the intervening years, up to 20,000 children were exposed to dangerous levels of lead and dozens died of Legionnaires’ disease before local residents and medical professionals convinced courts to intervene. Ultimately 9 government officials, including the state governor, were charged with criminal wrongdoing.\n\nOf all of the places that should understand the importance of water – our life blood, our livelihood, our recreation – it’s the Great Lakes state of Michigan.\n\nAll sale proceeds go to the Flint River Watershed Coalition.\n\nPhoto by Peter Baker\nMore info at https://peterbaker.net/flint-river",
