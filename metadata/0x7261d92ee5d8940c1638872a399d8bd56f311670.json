    "description": "Over the nearly thirty years since I drew two dogs sitting at a computer, with one of them saying to the other, “on the internet nobody knows you’re a dog,” that image has been reprinted, quoted, and cited in thousands of publications, on and offline.  \n\nThe first publication of the Internet Dogs in the New Yorker magazine in 1993 was a milestone, marking the moment the internet lost its innocence and internet identity became a problem.  \n\nSince then it has become a culturally significant icon standing for and symbolizing the problem of identity on the internet.  \n\nAs the originator of the cartoon, I've now made this [video](https://youtu.be/dJNIEFJ8ck8) sharing its story leading to minting the Internet Dogs as an NFT.",
