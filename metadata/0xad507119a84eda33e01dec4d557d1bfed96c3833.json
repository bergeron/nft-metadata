    "description": "\"Do kings cry? and if they do, who cosset them\nin their down times or are they perfect being?\" Different thoughts in my head, I started wishing I've someone I can pour out my whole mind to, someone trust worthy, someone I can feel safe with, someone who see things the way I see them, a helping hand when l am in a situation like that. thought about rulers and kings because the \"Status Quo\" believes a leader or a ruler has to be perfect and always there to solve people's problems leaving their own personal life, issues, weaknesses alone to attend to others. Let's not forget that we are all humans with a lot weaknesses and we all get tired and weary too. No one is a superhero in m opinion. With all these, I came to a conclusion that kings too are humans. With all I had going on in my mind and the heavy weight of things going on in my mind made me imagine what rulers and kings even go through each day of their lives. They should also be\nfeeling the way I felt or even more.",
