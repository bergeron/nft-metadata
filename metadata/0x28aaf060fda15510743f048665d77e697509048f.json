    "description": "Why is the Aurora light only at the north pole?  What would it be like elsewhere?  Where is the Aurora really?\n\nWhere Is the Aurora?\n\n Now in Egypt!\n\n With the fire of orange and scarlet.\n The colors of the aurora reflect the energy and aura of the country in which it is located.  Colors feel its warmth and mystical power.\n The main character's name is Aurora.\n She brings her light to the country her is in.\n She's a painter, and she leaves brushstrokes on countries.  Aurora dreams of a new world to be lost or found in.\n Sometimes it makes the concrete abstract, sometimes it makes the abstract concrete.\n Every tone she uses, every brushstroke has a meaning.  You will see all the special details of Egypt as you go deeper.\n\n Open your eyes and imagine a world where anything is possible.  Don't be afraid to get lost, Aurora will be your guide.\n\n\nThe Where Is Aurora collection is drawn and painted with special techniques of Artist Su, which emerges with the unique dance of digital and traditional art.  9000x12000\n\n\n\n love,\n SUðŸª¶",
