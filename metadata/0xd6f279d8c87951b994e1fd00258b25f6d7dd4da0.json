    "description": "Gina Beavers draws inspiration from digital and social media to produce luscious, provocative,\nthree-dimensional painting with recurring themes of food, lips, and breasts. Her visceral, often\nhumourous depictions of the feminine body that extend from the canvas and grab your attention. For\nETHDenver, we are thrilled to present Beavers' first digital project: \"A Van Gogh Painting of a\nMondrian Painting of a Munch Painting on my Lips.\" The work was developed through an AI-engine that\nrendered the artist's sly riff on an art world dominated, by men, who have now become unknowing\nparties to the machine-generated images, subserviently placed on the artist's signature lips.",
