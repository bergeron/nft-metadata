    "description": "This piece is about remembering that you are a child at heart. It's about reminiscing on the fun, the playing, and the laughter. Life is too short to be serious all of the time. Never lose your sense of wonder!  \nThis is a scene I captured just north of Victoria Beach in Laguna Beach, California. The last rays of sunlight were hitting the beach and the tide was steadily rising. Children were playing and laughing in this rock pool as the waves came crashing in. It was a magical moment to capture and I hope it brings you a sense of joy and wonder.",
