I think he had been around for a long, long time, and now he wanted to take me as his prisoner to serve him in this ratchet void. I couldn't move because of his cold blue eyes fixed on me; the creaking sound he made as he turned to me; and the dark mist he spread. This Halloween will be more terrifying than ever!",
