    "description": "The Danakil Depression is one of the most remote and inhospitable environments on this planet. \nThe remoteness of the Danakil combined with its extreme climate and striking visuals demonstrate how beauty can be found in the most desolate and far corners of the Earth.\nSituated in the remote north-eastern part of Ethiopia, few animals or plants can survive here. \nOnly the nomadic Afar people have settled nearby.\nIt is one of the most visually compelling and geologically fascinating destinations on Earth.\nThe vibrant colors are a result of seawater reacting with volcanic minerals in magma creating a kaleidoscopic landscape.\nThe resulting panorama is a series of four photos displaying the beauty created by the earthâ€™s natural processes.\n",
