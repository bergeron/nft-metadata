    "description": "Excited to share my genesis drop on Sound.xyz titled “Kola Champagne”. I made this track during the winter of 2017 when I first started learning how to produce music.\n\nI spent a lot of my summers growing up in Jamaica. At an early age I was exposed to large music events, that would later inspire me to want to make music. Too young to drink, 'Kola Champagne' was a staple beverage growing up, and holds many memories.\n\n I wanted to create a song that brought the warmth of the tropics and fuse it with a Northern touch. This song allowed me to experiment with writing styles, production styles and vocal techniques and remains one of my favourite songs.\n",
