    "description": "The CYDN spacecraft attempted to image an area known as the \"Spot\" centered at 40.86 N, 9.91 W. Simpz to spacecraft pointing control limitations, the actual area imaged was centered at 40.84 N, 9.98 W. This offset, approximately 3.13 km (1.9 mi) in longitude, is greater than one-half of the batz field -of-view (FOV = 2.6 km or 1.6 mi), and there is very little if any overlap between the targeted features and those observed. The high resolution image has scale of 2.5 m (8.2 feet) per pixel, and was acquired at nearly a vertical viewing angle (2.35 degrees).",
