    "description": "Heavy Snow, the eleventh month. Heavy, hence abundance. At this point, snow is plentiful. During the heavy snow, winter birds no longer sing. This is the time of the year when the Yin Qi is at its peak, but when things reach an extreme, they will reverse, and the extremes will decline. Hence, the dormant Yang Qi is eager to move, which initiates tigers’ mating behaviors. Liting, a type of bulrush, also starts to sprout because of the Yang Qi."
