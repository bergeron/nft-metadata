    "description": "Window to the Soul\n\n\"Just as a window allows us to gaze into a beautiful view, a person's eyes allow us to look into their very being, seeing all that they are and all that they feel\" \n\nAbout the collection \"Corpo Livre\"\n\n\"Corpo Livre\" means \"free body\" in English and refers to the freedom to be who you are.\n\n\"Corpo Livre\" is a state of mind and a connection with oneself and one's soul. This state of mind can be achieved through self-knowledge and acceptance of oneself, including all imperfections and differences. By having a free body, a person feels free to be who they are and express themselves authentically. \n\nIt is a state of freedom and authenticity that can bring much peace and fulfillment to a person's life.",
