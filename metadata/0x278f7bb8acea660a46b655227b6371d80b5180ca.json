    "description": "Oresteia I -\n \n'have you ever...'  2022 Oct.\n\nHave you ever walk in the woods alone, force yourself to go further with delicate fear. Or ever imagine heading through to night, naked. Surrounded by the sound of the orbit of emptiness, space flowing in your eyes.\n\nwhat am I, what am I\n\nAm I a painter, trying to paint all the unknowns or am I a muse with magic flute, salvation of childhood...am I a bleeding poet...\n\nwell then,\nlets be real, no rush\nthe only original thing is me\nOne in me...\n\n'Go on, try as you may, you won't find that night\nAnother shape of us hidden under the vines,\nRebellious to the core...'\n\n",
