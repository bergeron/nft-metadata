    "description": "\"B L O O M\" is a  1/1s collection of 10 original pieces from BEASTBOIII. Here he dissects different mech characters from his childhood, who inspires the concept of living within a shell. Our bodies and what we project isn't who we are. This is an exploration and a tribute to the love for these characters, as well to the knowing that there is more to us than meets the eye.",
