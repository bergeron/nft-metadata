    "description": "Autumn is always a magical time in the Black Forest in Germany. The time where the forest turns into something special and gets alive. The trees are constantly changing their dress to different beautiful colors and the fog adds some mystic to it. The scenes are changing in minutes, even in seconds and it is just amazing to watch it evolve.",
