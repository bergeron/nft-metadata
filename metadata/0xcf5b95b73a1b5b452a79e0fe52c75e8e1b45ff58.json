    "description": "Break the rules, break the mold, and push the envelope. This is how we evolve as humans, as artists.\n\nThis image doesn't have a crazy backstory. I didn't go through hell and back to get it. What it does have is a different story for each person that views it. Some may have nostalgic feelings from playing basketball as a kid at school. Some may be able to smell the pine trees and fresh rain in the air. The interpretation is what makes this piece special, what does it mean to you?",
