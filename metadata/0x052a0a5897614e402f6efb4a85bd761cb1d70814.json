    "description": "This is the very first item from the collection of photos made in Dongdaemun district in Seoul, South Korea. \nThe monumental plaza designed by the famous Zaha Hadid became the sparkle of this area, and it makes me feel like I'm in a sci-fi movie every time I'm around. \nAlso, there is a large market nearby that even more reminds you of cyberpunk stylistics. To add on, you can find a plethora of Russian stores around, which makes this place even more special for me as a Russian artist.",
