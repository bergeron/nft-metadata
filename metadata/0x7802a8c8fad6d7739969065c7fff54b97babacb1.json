    "description": "'Acquiescence' is a little story, an audio-visual work inspired by Italian and Russian poetry, E. Hemingway's 'The Snows of Kilimanjaro', and by seeing death among us day by day. Relentlessly, but maybe with hope that it is just a new beginning. \nWith an acquiescence.  \n\n'Verrà la morte e avrà i tuoi occhi' (Italian words you can hear during watching) is a poem by an Italian writer Cesare Pavese. \n\nMade with: 3DsMax + Marvelous Designer + After Effects + UE5 + Studio One\n\nDetails:\nfull-size video = .mov, 2000x1500px.\n\nThank you/.",
