    "description": "A visualization of alone time. When being in solitude is voluntary, itâ€™s ok - it can be rejuvenating. No judgement, no worries of being relevant or accepted, It allows us to reboot, to plan, designs our dream and sometimes takes us on a sentimental journey. It is the time when we are vulnerable to our self and our ego spills all truths.\n\nOriginal music.",
