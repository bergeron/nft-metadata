    "description": "TashimayaXGoodboiENMA is a collaboration between two japanese artists, breaking the borders between two completely different art forms.\n\nTashimaya, a master of Shodō - the japanese art of calligraphy, makes traditional analog paintings on paper in his unique calligraphy style.\n\nGoodboiEnma creates digital illustrations inspired by japanese Ukiyo-e paintings combined with the vibrant colors similar to vaporwave.\n\nTogether they made their first collaboration trying to cross the border between their art forms.\n\nThis artwork depicts the japanese Kanji for \"bear\". Both calligraphy and illustration express the natural and raw power of bears in the wild.\nBy buying this artwork you support both Tashimaya and GoodboiEnma. It's a 50/50 split.",
