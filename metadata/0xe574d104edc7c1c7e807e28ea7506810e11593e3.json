    "description": "This place is inspired by London Bridge - a place I visit very often when I'm on my way to work. \nIt gives the feeling of an eternal re-birth and starting a new day to be productive and create art. Phoenix is the perfect representation of that. \nThe great revival of art.\n\nCreated in CLIP STUDIO PAINT.\nAnimated in Adobe After Effects.\n\nCollector receives full size of the still image as well as the animation in both MP4 and GIF. (2500 x 3500)\n",
