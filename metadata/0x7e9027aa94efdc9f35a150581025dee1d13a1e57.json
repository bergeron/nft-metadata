    "description": "Artist, producer, and DJ oshi delivers the perfect sad boy summer bop with “i know you’re tired of driving.” Angsty, raw and broodingly romantic, Oshi wears his heart on his sleeve. “i know you’re tired of driving” captures unfiltered emotion while managing to result in a compelling final product, ready for club tears all summer long. \n\nInspired by a drum sample, oshi utilizes a chopped vocal and glitchy drum break to add a satisfying element of danceability, “Sometimes I make songs just to work through feelings.”  \n\n----\n\nThis is the twelfth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
