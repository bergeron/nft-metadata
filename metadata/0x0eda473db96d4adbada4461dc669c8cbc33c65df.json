    "description": "The First Step\n\nEvery new journey begins with a first step. Every first step is a physical manifestation of ideas, planning, hopes and dreams with a good dash of the unknown.  \n\nThis image holds deep importance to me as it signifies my first foray into photography. This is the 13th photograph I ever took.  The photograph was taken with a nascent technology at a pivotal time of my life and woke within me the desire to continue to capture and share the beauty of our world pixel by pixel.\n\nJoin me in looking back at this first step.\n\nThis photograph was taken by awhurst in Bonaire on December 22, 2002 on a very old digital camera.\n\nToken holder is free to use image in advertising, private or group display, including but not limited to galleries, print media, and virtual galleries as long as creator is credited.",
