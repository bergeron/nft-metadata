    "description": "Veiled Entropy marks the beginning of an exciting journey exploring the intersection of human creativity and AI technology. Using Perlin noise and randomization algorithms, this artwork displays a mesmerising interaction between light and colour, as if depicting a cosmic dance of particles in space. I drew inspiration from the beauty and chaos of the universe, seeking to capture the undefinable essence of creation itself. Each stroke, each pixel and each algorithmic decision invites us to experience the limitless possibilities of art and technology, and to consider how they may influence our shared future.",
