    "description": "No one knew who created the Inhabitants of Gune Planet. They are part human and part robot. Around them stood a species which observed them day and night and did not sleep at all. Their eyes shone red in the dark and their touch was rigid. \nA cyborg named Eve is delighted to have seen her first snake, beautiful bright and blue. She reaches to capture the being with no consequences. The snake with its eyes prays upon the beautiful cyborg, urging her to follow a path of destiny.\nThe future is programmed. \n\nAcrylic Physical Painting \n11-inch x 14-inch\n27.94 cm x 35.56 cm\n",
