    "description": "This is my Wurlitzer 200. I took this picture with my Rolleiflex 2.8F camera. The picture includes four overlapping images as multiple exposures. I developed it in a very cold Rodinal developer (10C / 50F) to extend the development time. That develops darks fully without burning the whites through.",
