    "name": "The Temptress of Malabar",
    "description": "In the dead of the night,  beneath the pale moonlight, stood a woman like no other that he had seen, an absolute goddess. The light of the moon perfectly enveloped her voluptuous figure clad in a white saree and jet black hair. His eyes drank every bit of her beauty and a burning desire to possess her, crept up in the heart of the young Namboothiri,  As if sensing his thoughts, the woman wore a sly smile on her rosy red lips as if to invite him to her abode. His eyes lit up and the thrilled youngster approached the woman, like a moth to a flame, His lust taking reins of his senses. As she led him to a secluded place and began undressing slowly, the man froze in his tracks. The voluptuous naked figure in front of him had turned into a bloodthirsty creature with green skin and glowing eyes. The horror grew tenfold as his eyes fell on the skulls of her victims some of whom had been petrified with time. His throat ran dry, even as he uttered the word that would be his last...YAKSHI!",
