    "description": "Each HOLI depicts a distinctive moment of the week-long festival of the Lathmar Holi in India.\n\nThanks to local connections, the author has managed to access privileged vantage observation points, allowing him to pursue and create a series of images in which each shot has both an artistic and descriptive intrinsic value at the same time.\n\nTwo pro-grade camera bodies with lenses and waterproof covers have been used throughout the event to achieve the widest possible range of shots despite the extreme harsh conditions.\n\nEach HOLI is named after one of the temples of the Mathura district, in the cities of Barsana Nandgaon and Vrindavan.",
