    "description": "The pictures taken of this owl are the most time spent in my photography life... I took pictures for 60 consecutive days at a distance of about 200 km and went on duty at eight o'clock to shoot these owl pictures... Therefore, I was able to capture many rare moments...\n\nI took this picture of the owl and it is from Saudi Arabia... it lives in isolated areas of the desert and rocks. When I arrived there the owl was sitting on a rocky mountain. The moment it looked at me with its fiery eyes was caught on camera. I knew it would be something special!!. Remember today the joy I felt when I saw the pictures taken after the photographs were taken on the camera display...\n\nlocation : Jubail, Saudi Arabia ID: Pharaoh eagle-owl ðŸ¦‰ camera & lens : Nikon D850 + 200 - 500 mm Nikkor lens\n\n",
