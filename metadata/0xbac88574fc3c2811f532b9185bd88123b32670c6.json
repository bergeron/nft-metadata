    "description": "'I am losing my headscarf in different public places in Iran. An apparently banal mishap fraught with the risk of police detention, and an outsider’s tribute to Iranian women’s art of everyday resistance at the surface of state-sanctioned public behaviour and hijab modesty.'\n\nOm graduated from the Hungarian University of Fine Arts (MA. Intermedia Studies) and the Berlin University of Arts (Meisterschülerin, Fine Arts). She is represented by Art of Future, a member of the Studio of Young Artists’ Association in Budapest and the Saloon Network in Berlin. Bori´s work combines still and moving images with different narrative genres, from memoir to documentary through to song and tale. It explores the intersection of visual and verbal exposition by means of videos, animations, drawings, objects, rhythms and algorithms.",
