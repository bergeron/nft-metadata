    "description": "hello again friends !\n\n\"Through the Haze\" is the next installment in my series of experimental B-sides.  \n\nin between major projects, i find myself working on tracks that i describe as \"brain cleanse\" sessions.  these tracks tend to function as a creative oil change and help flush out whatever previous project i was working on.  they also help with exploring new avenues of sound design and songwriting.  \n\nthis particular project was created entirely on my modular synthesizer system.  a few years back, i was approached by a company that sold music for movie/tv trailers, and they wanted a piece of music from me.  i had absolutely no clue how to write that type of music, so i ended up just jamming on my modular system and wound up with the fun, mysterious journey you hear today.\n\ni also just got off of an extensive tour, so you can expect to hear more from me in the coming months.  thanks for listening, hope yall enjoy <3 ",
