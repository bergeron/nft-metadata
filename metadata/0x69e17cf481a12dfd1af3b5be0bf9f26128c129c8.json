    "description": "This piece was created after my trip to Macau with a few photographers. We took the ferry over to Macau from Hong Kong for the day to explore this urbanised city, formerly Portuguese colony. Macau, just like Hong Kong is a city which are highly urbanised and have mixtures of tall modern office and hotel buildings as well as old residential tower blocks, it's a city that really fascinates me. We spent the day exploring the city and experienced local cuisines, taking in as much as we can.\n\nOne of many places we have explore was this 25 floors residential tower block, the combinations of the symmetrical design as well as the scale of the tower block created a sense of endless perspective when you're standing in the middle looking up. We spent around 20-30 minutes there to photographed the place as much as we can. In the end, this was one that speak to me most. As a photographer, I am quite obsessed with symmetry, so photographing symmetrical building like this was very special for me.",
