    "description": "HOOKED is a record by the Ethiopian-American artist Siimbiie Lakew dealing with complexities of addiction and abuse rooted in unresolved trauma. The song is a reflective and introspective look into the artistâ€™s mind during his time struggling with survival and ways to cope in harsh / unstable environments. Unapologetic and transparent as usual, the song is meant to be a testament to the ability to overcome such things as well as a reminder that those going through similar challenges are not alone.",
