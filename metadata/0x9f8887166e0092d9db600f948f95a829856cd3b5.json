    "description": "The title of this artwork is RELIEF and This demonstrates a paradox. There are some countries that restrict women to cover themselves and wear hijab, but in this art although this woman is forced to wear hijab , she is looking for a relief.\nAs you can see in this art she has found this relief in painting her nails.\nThe light on the wall is shown lack of freedom and indicates the prison of mind.\n\n_Oil on canvas\n-This piece was published in LEONARDO magazine in SPAIN, 2022",
