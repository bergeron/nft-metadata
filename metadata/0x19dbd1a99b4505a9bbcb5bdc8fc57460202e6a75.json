    "description": "Tarpons are for me one of the wonders of Bonaire, an island in the Netherlands Caribbean. They are large fish that measure up to 2 m (8 ft) long and can weight up to 120 Kg (265 lb) Despite their imposing size they are very curious and friendly; You are never alone when diving with them.\n\nDuring the day they aren't very active and relatively few are seen, but at night they star a special show: the hunt.\n\nDiving with a group of tarpons at night is a unique experience. They will use the diver's lights as target-lights to pinpoint their preys to quickly eat them, with a low and sudden noise.\n\nThey'll get so close to you that they will actually push you aside hard. Is in that moment you thank that tarpons are not aggressive!\n\n- - - - - -\n\nI'll ship a high quality Fine Art print to the first collector of this piece. I use acid free 195 grs cotton fiber paper and mineral ink.\n\nDIMENSIONS: 6000x4000 @ 300 dpi\nPRINT SIZE: 51 cm x 32 cm (20.1 in x 12.6 in)\n\n(DM me on twitter for any question!)",
