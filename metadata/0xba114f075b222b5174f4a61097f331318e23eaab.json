    "name": "Trippy Opal Solar Flare",
    "description": "We see reds, oranges, and Yellows with the naked eye when gazing upon the explosive surface of the Sun's plasma.  The intense fusion reactions and dense gravitational forces give the sun its shape, as it burps electromagnetic radiation from every frequency in the visible electromagnetic spectrum.  There are so many elements of light we cannot see, that what we can is incredibly limited in the scale of potential Rainbows the sun is painting throughout our universe.  The Trippy Opal Solar Flare is a 5kx5k pixel collaborative artwork drawn by Jams2blues, and colored in by his wife Anna Lee.",
