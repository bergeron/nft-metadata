    "description": "Snorkelling in a serene lake, I was thrilled to come across a school of curious European perch swimming among clouds of pink-tinged algae. But beneath the beauty lies a warning - the algal blooms could result from climate change.\n\nI want to share this extraordinary painting-like beauty as a limited edition NFT series, highlighting the importance of raising awareness about the issue of global warming and its impact on our environment.\n\nI will donate 10% of the proceeds to The Finnish Natural Heritage Foundation to support their efforts in purchasing and permanently protecting forest areas.",
