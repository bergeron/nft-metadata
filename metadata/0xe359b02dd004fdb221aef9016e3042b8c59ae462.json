If you look close enough, you can find a sense of serenity in every corner.\n\nOn this evening, my son and I wandered the desert looking for visions of clarity and we were lucky to find many. In this shot, we found ourselves overlooking a small valley framed by the small trees and shrubs. A perfect place to capture the Milky Way.",
