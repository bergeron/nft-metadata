    "description": "Why are cats so sensitive to the otherworld?\n\nIn a pre-dawn dream, the boundary between this and the other world blurs, becomes transparent and barely perceptible. A person becomes vulnerable and lost. Just like in a roadside motel with its plywood walls and numerous stories and traces of the presence of other people.\nIn graphic editors, transparency is displayed as a checkerboard. And also the checkerboard symbolizes the presence of black and white in our lives at every step, this and the other world.\n\n3D rendered, 1920x1920 px, mp4",
