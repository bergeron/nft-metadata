    "description": "The Pi単ata has always been a symbol of celebrations and gatherings. Growing up half Mexican my siblings and I always went to family events at our Mexican families side. There were always Pi単atas for birthday events. We were always welcomed in their homes even though we were never taught Spanish as a language from our father and the other half of our bloodline is \"white\". \n\nWe never had parties with pi単atas. We never had those big family gatherings at our house because our father excluded us from knowing anything about our heritage and culture and our family's migration to the USA. He never wanted to include us in family events.\n\nThis is image is my Pi単ata. This is my celebration of being a Queer Latinx artists in a new space that has accepted me for me and can celebrate this moment with me. \n\nFantastic Planet",
