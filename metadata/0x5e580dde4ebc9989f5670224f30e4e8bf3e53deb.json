    "description": "Welcome into the realm of magic and abstract. A handpicked collection of dreams and nightmares living on the edge of horror and surreal.\n\nThe Author is an architect, graphic designer and recently, an aficionado of AI generated images.\n\nAll pictures are created by him using various AI software to produce amazing images. Some are funny, some are sad, some are beautiful, some are really mad.\n\nIt is a process of hard work, trial and error, trying to understand how to control this new and raw technology to get the image or the idea that you have in mind.",
