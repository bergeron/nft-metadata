    "description": "This collaboration is an accidental initiative between Alexandra & Thomasupernova. We decided to collaborate on an artwork and Avril came to our thoughts, why not make something together for avril as we both love the avril15 project. \n\nIn our illustration, we include alot of retro pop culture elements & what we both are into, pop-surrealism, which can be seen in our other artworks. Not straying away from the Avril concept, we stick to the vivid & vibrant colours, Pete, and also our own rendition of Avril. \n\nCompromising, communicating, teamwork and understanding is what we learn from creating this art piece together :)",
