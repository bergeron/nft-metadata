    "description": "Every year on the 4th of July, the people of Los Angeles put on the world's largest, decentralized light show. To fully appreciate the grandeur of this uncoordinated phenomenon, one must see it from a perspective that allows you to witness as much of the sprawling city as possible.\n\nIn 2017 I captured it at 5,715 feet above the city from the Mount Wilson Observatory. This video was featured on TIME.com and around the world on social media as it went viral, introducing the internet to the wonders that are the DECENTRA-LIGHTS of Los Angeles.\n\nThis video is a hi resolution remastered version of the original animation that went viral on Instagram. Now released as a Limited Edition of 99.",
