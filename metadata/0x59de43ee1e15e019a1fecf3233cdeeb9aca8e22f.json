    "description": "Pepe University hostel students tend to be lazy because they are beginning their college life and this age is the age of enjoyment, freedom, freeness in their lifetime. Hostel students have no care for the next day, the same routine of going to university, assignments, lectures, and also, they have some kind of friends.\n\nBecause nobody will take control of the hostel students. So, they became even lazier to wash their clothes, and also clean their rooms.\n\nCredit:  Matt Furie\n\nArtwork By Nftroaster",
