    "description": "Synchronicity entails that there's a deep connection between physical and psychic events, akin to a message from a greater power. \n\nit is the connection between the physical world and your consciousness. The message is communicated through symbols via dreams that connect with physical world events. This synchronised coincidences purpose is for us to look inwards to decipher the message being shared with us. \n\nYou shouldn't be asking why is this happening but what is the message behind the connected message.\n\n“Synchronicity is the coming together of inner and outer events in a way that cannot be explained by cause and effect and that is meaningful to the observer.”  \n― Carl Jung",
