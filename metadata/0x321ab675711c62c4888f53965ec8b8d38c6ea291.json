    "description": "The SCREENSUGI series is an attempt to fail best and “fail better,” as Beckett put it. \n\nThe artist is inspired by Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, that gives artifacts a second life.\n\nDe Wilde explores the ambivalent status of compression- and glitch aesthetics, broken screens and repairing, in order to open up critical spaces for reflection in our techno-saturated culture. In the tech world efficiency, control and immediacy rule. Failure, noise and glitches are avoided at all costs, but are of great interest to artists like Frederik De Wilde. \n\nFormat: UHD video (2160 px x 3840 px), Perfect Loop \nTime: 00:08'\nTechnique: Custom GLSL shaders\n\nCollectors Note: Selected for EDAF - European Digital Art Fair 2022",
