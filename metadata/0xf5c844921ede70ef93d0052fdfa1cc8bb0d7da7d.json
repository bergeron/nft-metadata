    "description": "Kobe Bryantâ€™s legacy as one of the greatest basketball players of all time is firmly cemented in place. He was larger than life, and once scored 81 points in an NBA game. In 2017, the Lakers retired both his #8 and #24 jerseys, making him the only player in NBA history to have multiple jerseys retired by the same franchise. This skate deck commemorates his legacy as one of the greatest athletes of all time. ",
