    "description": "Japan. At one of the many wars on the far east, there was a young couple fighting back to back. To always stay with each other, they got married and continued to fight for their homeland. The samurai taught his wife all kinds of martial arts that he knew. Together they went through many battles until death claimed the life of her husband. After his death, she came to the temple at the site of their first battle every day, and forgetting about the time, she turned into a stone resembling a statue. Many years later, the spirit of the samurai still managed to find his beloved. His presence killed all life and transformed the reality around. Since then, he has been living in that temple, along with his petrified wife.",
