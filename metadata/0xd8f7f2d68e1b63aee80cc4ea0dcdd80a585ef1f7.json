    "name": "The Dark Shark Nebula",
    "description": "LDN 1235 or the Dark Shark Nebula is a beautiful dark nebula in the constellation of Cepheus which resembles our favourite ocean predator. It is comprised of dark dust which is faintly illuminated by the surrounding stars and is thus very difficult to image, requiring exceptionally dark skies and moonless nights. I travelled to dark skies on the West of Ireland to image under exceptionally dark skies. \n\nThe Dark Shark is about 650 light years away and you can see a distant galaxy PGC 67671 through the dust in the top right of the frame. You can also note 2 small blue reflection nebula vdB 149 and vdB 150. \n\nOver 16 hours of data was acquired by Ronan Hunt under the dark skies of Castlegregory, Co. Kerry. \n\nA physical print will be made for the first collector should they wish it. \n\nPhotographer: Ronan Hunt\nFull Resolution: 4144x3315 pix, 1/1 Edition Jpeg\nImage Credit: Ronan Hunt\n",
