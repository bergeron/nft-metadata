    "description": "Short stories about the cities of Ukraine most affected by the occupation by the russians. Captured and destroyed, they will be all released and restored. The ENDEMICS collection is dedicated to individual cities of Ukraine that continue to resist the enemy, engulfed in war, and to cities that have the opportunity to \"restore their habitat\". Each flower is a separate story, unique, which does not exist anywhere else...\nThe ENDEMICS project is virtual plants that combine features of folk art of Ukraine and represent signs and symbols in traditional types of fine art and decorative painting.\nEndemics are unique representatives of the flora that do not exist anywhere else. The isolation of these species is due to circumstances - in this case, it is a war in Ukraine, from which the whole world will suffer as a result.\n\nRoksolana Dudka - sculpting\nVartan Markarian - background, animation\n\n1200Ñ…1200 px., 30 fps, loop",
