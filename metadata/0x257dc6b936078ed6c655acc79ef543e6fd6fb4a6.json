    "description": "During the first lockdown I started to explore the fenced off and forgotten landscapes along the coast near my home. These places are uncompromising, and loaded with a distinct beauty and complexity. I never saw anybody during this time, but you can feel a presence. An older historical one - when these places had a clear function. But also a more recent one, a playful but dangerous space full of surprises. In particular Iâ€™m interested in interventions, both natural and unnatural. Uncovering echoes of the past, present and future.",
