    "description": "Originally lost in the \"Great M1 Macbook Migration\", this is a bail√© remix of the intro track to easily my most masterful work to date, \"CHROMA\" released June of 2018, finalized and immortalized in, and inspired while I was in Thailand for the very first time.\n\nThis project is another of my many releases that speaks to and of my soul, the kind of style of music I wanna hear everywhere, and this particular track (the original) is what birthed the whole rest of CHROMA. After having released 3 of these very rare remixes ONLY on-chain, on another truly dope music NFT marketplace, Catalog, I feel like I inadvertently saved the best of the remixes for last, none more representative of the most evolved of my signature sound than this groove right here, and I want everyone to know that collects it:  light a candle, smoke a bowl or a joint, concoct your favorite libation, and put this one on repeat, and prepare to get lost in this groove, as this was what it was designed for.\n\nFor nothing else moves me more than making others do the same \nüôèüèΩüï∫üèΩüíÉüèΩ...",
