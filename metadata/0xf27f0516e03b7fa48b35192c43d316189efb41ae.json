    "description": "Get ready to jump into a new world with Ava & Ramona! \n\nI thought to give a new experience to Ava and Ramona by taking them to my native place, Palakkad. So they travel from a city in the US to the green plains of Palakkad, wearing their most colorful masks created by Abhilash Nair.\n\nPalakkad is a beautiful place with hills, rivers, & mountain streams. It's a city in Kerala, a state in southwestern India.\n\n'Palakkad Vibes' is my first collaboration with another native from Palakkad and amazing animator, Abhilash Nair. He created two exclusive masks for AVA & Ramona, and as you see, they adore them!",
