    "description": "I looked at these two as they watched the screens before them. I was only aware of what they had in common after I developed the photograph. You might say \"I wasn't really looking\" for anything, at the time. Therein lies a distinction between watching and looking. One feels passive, the other more active. We look constantly for things in life: love, approval, meaning. We see so much. What are we looking at? What are we watching?",
