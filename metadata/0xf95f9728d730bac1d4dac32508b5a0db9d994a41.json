    "description": "I originally wrote this tune to the Showtime Riddim. I grew up on reggae and dancehall and a lot of my flow and vibe is influenced by the sound of artists like Beenie Man and Patra. I think there is a deep strength in reggae music that I love to tap into in my creations. The lyrics of the song are influenced by my big brain, my hunger and my hardcore flows. I like to think if Lil' Kim and Lauryn Hill made an art child, she would be me. I think I wrote this in a flow state. I sometimes don't have a concept before writing. I just let myself flow through it. Those are usually my favorite cause they are coming from the subconscious. haha. The production is by the incredible Kaui who also produced Culture. \n\nThis song is a part of the Joyride collection. Joyride is special to me cause they are verses I would imagine while riding my bike during the pandemic. They are verses riding me and you to my new album coming next year. A transitional project...maybe an EP in the near future. We shall see. \n\nThe artwork is designed by the amazing Tai (@blazingTai). And Golden Egg design is by the world builder, ATM (@dillionatm)\n\nIf you collect all Joyride music nfts, you will automatically become a part of TASHDAO coming 2023, have voting rights to what songs will end up on my upcoming album and can even become a part of the writing or branding team support. \n\nExcited for these new walks we are taking with web3 cause I get to make music I wish to explore while also having a bomb community be a part of the journey with me. \n\nBig tings a gwan.\nTash",
