    "name": "7 Sins: Wrath",
    "description": "\"Wrath  can be defined as uncontrolled feelings of anger, rage, and even hatred. Wrath often reveals itself in the wish to seek vengeance. In its purest form, wrath presents with injury, violence, and hate that may provoke feuds that can go on for centuries.\n\nIn her introduction to Purgatory, Dorothy L. Sayers describes wrath as \"love of justice perverted to revenge and spite\".\"\n\nThis work was both morally and physically demanding for me. After all, this is exactly the feeling I have been experiencing for the past three weeks.\n\n",
