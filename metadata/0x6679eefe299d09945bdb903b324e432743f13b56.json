    "description": "A new beginning.\n\n\"Provenance\" is the first installment in the \"Stages of Life II\" series. A body of work composed of narratives done in the \"Neo-Fauvism\" style created by YAGAMIII. Neo-Fauvism is a refined illustrative take on Fauvism exploring Color Theory  & Story-Telling, a hybrid of Classical and Modern art movements. \n\nThis work is based on the Greek Myth surrounding the Sister of Fate. A Trio of entities that \"weave\" the Destiny of us all. The Protagonist sits at the base of the Tree of Life, writing their own fate, seeking enlightenment for what's to come. ",
