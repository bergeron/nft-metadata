    "description": "Candid photography portraits of individuals riding the number 7 train at the Junction Blvd Station in Jackson Heights, NY, one of the most diverse neighborhoods on earth, where 160+ languages are spoken. This photography artwork is composed of upward of 40 fragments taken from separate photographs. Except for the portraits, all the fragments have been aleatorily re-layered and recolored in post-production. \n\nWith the recent rise of white supremacy and anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S., I felt compelled to document the \"Other\" Americans because people portrayed in Vessels are Americans, born on this continent, a land stretching from Patagonia to Alaska.\n\nI was not conscious at first that the reason I selected to compose these works with the surfaces of the skin of trains coursing through the sky was reflective of the immigrant histories of people who walked entire continents in a sort of delirium to get here.\n\nMore on my website @ www.ma9.co. Link in bio. ",
