    "name": "Life Is Over",
    "description": "In her previous life, she was a gamer. A lot of time has passed since then. You know, it doesn't seem to matter anymore. There is nothing else here, neither time nor feelings. Just a game that's never finished. Once it seemed to her that she had conquered death, but is it possible to defeat what is no longer there? Life or death?\nDoes it matter if she's where there's nothing. The cartridge of the game is running, she has already inhaled the magic gas. The game must continue, even if life is already over.\n\n1/1 art for Avril15 fan art s3\n",
