    "description": "This was the first trip I took in Nov 2020, after 8 months of pandemic hit since March 2020.\nWe went on a bike trip to the tea garden hills of Wayanad in Kerala in India. We had a great time with wonderful people in the campsites, life felt normal again. Next day morning as we waited for the sunrise, the fog started flowing on the hills opposite to us. This was a beautiful sight, giving us hope of the good days ahead.\n\nArtist: Arun Hegden\nEdition: 1/1\nFormat: Jpg\nDimensions: 3040*3800",
