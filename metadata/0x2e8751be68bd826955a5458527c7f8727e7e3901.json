    "description": "During the bombing, we slept at the end of the corridor, because it was the farthest point from windows. They were covered with brown tape in the shape of the letter X, to prevent the glass from scattering all over the apartment due to the detonation.\n\nThe TV was at the corridor beginning, closer to the windows. Mother was afraid to approach the video recorder to change the tape because shrapnel from the explosion could break through the window. So we just watched Bambi over and over again for 78 days.",
