    "description": "The Cliff House is an iconic San Francisco restaurant set atop the famous Sutro Baths. Unfortunately, this place became a casualty of the cities mandated lock downs, though it still remains as a popular look out for locals looking to get out of the house. This photo was made using a street photography technique known as Fishing, where I created my composition and patiently waited for a subject to capture the moment. \n\nPhoto is shot with a Contax G2 on Kodak 400",
