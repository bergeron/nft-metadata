    "description": "Once upon a time, an artist named Roy had been an avid collector of digital artwork for years. He had spent countless hours browsing online galleries and marketplaces, looking for the perfect pieces to add to his collection. However, he found that many of the pieces he loved were out of his price range. Why is it so hard to buy beautiful digital art without spending a fortune on it? he thought to himself. Roy shared his frustrations with his friends, who also shared their love for digital art. We should start a project to sell amazing NFTs for non-insane prices, said one friend. We should make minting for NFTs fun and surprising again, said another. We should use a portion of the proceeds to support emerging digital artists, said a third. Eureka! ROYL was born.",
