    "description": "My home is bleeding, because they came to take it. They're making things against humanity and lying to their people. Not an hour passes without me hearing explosions or shooting. Not an hour passes without damage they cause to our army and civilian people, our hospitals, schools, infrastructure. \n\nI never thought about politics and wars before, because I have a passion for art and design - but one day changed everything. I cannot believe this is happening.\n\nI decided to fight back with the weapon I have - my art and my voice to scream as loud as possible, as I'm not a warrior - I'm an illustrator. I wanna bring back peace to our houses. I'm so much grateful for all countries which are helping Ukraine, I'm grateful for our Ukrainian government, army, and volunteers who are fighting for us, for our home, and our future.\n\nI wanna contribute at least 50% of this NFT to our official fund, which is helping our country to fight: https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/",
