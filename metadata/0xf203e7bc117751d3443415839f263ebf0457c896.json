    "description": "A beautiful morning, pre meditation picture. Seemed like such a peaceful image to share with everyone. And suitable for my first manifold drop, or last =)  \nMy first experience with manifold. Searched for what I thought was a beautiful image to share with all of you. A normal photo for normal people, no editing, no special camera. Just a moment of my life that I thought it was worth sharing!",
