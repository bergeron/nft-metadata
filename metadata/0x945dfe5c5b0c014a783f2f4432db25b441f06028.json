    "description": "This work is the first of this collection and my very first work on this platform.\n\nFormat: 5504 x 6880 pixels\n\nThe photo was originally taken with a Zenit analog film camera, which is over 50 years old. After the photo was digitized and uploaded to the platform.\n\nHarmony and positive energy is exactly what I associate with this place. These are the emotions I feel when I remember those moments and those people.\n",
