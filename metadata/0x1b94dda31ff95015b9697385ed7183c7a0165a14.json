    "description": "Where is the border between “artificial” and “natural”? I aimed to depict old skin of insect such as beetle for this work. The image itself is created using engine parts of motorcycle.\n\nIn my work, I attempt to represent organic shape by combining and processing inorganic motifs such as metal and plastic. My expression is of the moment when an inorganic object has an awakening, and depict the shape as “something,” which exists between biotic and abiotic realm in abstract and realistic ways of painting. The technology which expands our physical ability such as A.I. has become a part of our life (body) more naturally, whether physically or morally. But we can’t escape from the uncanny and discomfort of our actual body becoming data-like and being controlled by the machines.",
