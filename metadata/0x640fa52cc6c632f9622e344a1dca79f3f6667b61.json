    "description": "100% of the proceeds from your donation mint goes to charity. This is a collection of profile pic art for WolfPak members supporting non-profits serving children in foster care and at-risk communities through mentorship and life skills programs. 80% goes to Urban Surf 4 Kids (EIN: 26-4600440) and 20% goes to HJM Foundation (EIN: 87-4107745). Use the EINs for your tax-deductible donation records. When you list each item for secondary sale on a platform that supports EIP-2981 (creator royalty at the contract level; e.g. LooksRare), the 98.99% royalty goes to charity so you can use it to fundraise for our community and spread to joy of giving. [Please DO NOT USE OPENSEA, (max 10% royalty) or other non EIP-2981 supporting platforms].",
