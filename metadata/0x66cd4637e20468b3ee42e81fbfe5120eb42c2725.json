    "description": "Burn to emerge. Immortality and rebirth.\nThe mythological Phoenix disappears and reappears.\nIt can be found in much of ancient Eastern artwork from Sung Dynasty vases to Greek colosseums.\nIt also represents a symbol of the world being rebuilt after theÂ Second World War.\n\nThe legendary longevity of the Phoenix can be compared to the blockchain.\nWe are experiencing exponential transformative developments.\nBlockchain and AI have fundamental changed the way we live, work, and relate to one another.\n\nHere the motif is to sprout with life.\nTo be reborn from the remnants of the old.\nBurn to emerge. Immortality and rebirth.",
