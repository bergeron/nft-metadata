    "description": "A creator sits on his throne trapped inside a glass cell. The glass jar is his mind. The light bulb represents an unfinished idea, an unsolved problem, something not quite figured out, life. Birds represent thoughts flying around the creators head. Attempting to incubate the idea to completion all while keeping a fixed eye on the rat peering through the glass. The throne represents identity and legacy. Something the creator is forever locked too. Through the lock you can see the outside world. Peaceful and harmonious and unattainable until he figures out the key. Oh and theres a skull in the clouds which i will leave up to your own interpretation. ",
