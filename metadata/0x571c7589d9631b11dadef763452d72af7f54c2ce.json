    "description": "It started from a quote in a book I read one day and it says “Happiness is that you eat delicious food with someone you love every day”.\nThe more I think of a good dinner, the more I’m reminded of some good conversation, warm mood, love, friendship and laughter I had with the people I care about.\nTurned those into abstract shapes and playful compositions with colors.",
