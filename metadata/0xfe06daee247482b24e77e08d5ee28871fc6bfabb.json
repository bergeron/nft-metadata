    "description": "“Sand comes alive and creatures are born in frozen moments of weightlessness...” \n\nThe series forms part of my ongoing 'Gravity Project', where the earth's different elements are captured to let them stand out in their natural surroundings using moments of zero gravity.  \n\n‘Sand Creatures I’ series focuses on nature in an unexpected way. The explosive and at times powdery scenes of the grainy sand being thrown into the air can be taken as a manifesting life form, as they become sand creatures. \n\nIn this unique, animated NFT collection, the Sand Creatures come to life, blown away by the fresh sea breeze off the Dutch coast.\n\nThe series has been featured in several publications including The Huffington Post, Wired and ABCNews and have been exhibited in national- and international exhibitions in Zurich, Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam.",
