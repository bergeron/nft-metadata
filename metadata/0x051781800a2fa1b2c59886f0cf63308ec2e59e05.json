    "description": "Composition derived from three images taken at:\n\nBig Freedia\nfeaturing Tank and the Bangas and Deep Velvet\nOctober 15, 2016\nat Strange Matter in Richmond, VA\n\n---\n\nThe air conditioner at Smatter was still broken and it was humid and sweaty. This show was completely packed. As short as I am, the only way I got this shot was by pressing through the crowd and standing on the stairs that lead from the floor to the stage, snapping this while she was walking through the crowd (they never had a green room) and then getting the hell out of her way. She passes through her crowds like royalty. The absolute frenzy of her fans shooting video as she walked within inches of them was electric.\n\n---\n\nI capture things the way I remember them: non-linear time in blurs of intense kinetic energy, sound, and emotion.\n\nCaptured here:\nElation\nFrenzy\nDelirium\nAwe\nOverwhelm\n\nby Wesley McQuillen",
