    "description": "Long ago, ten suns scorched the heavens and the earth below. Houyi, a legendary archer, shot down nine of the suns and restored balance to the world. \nAs thanks, the gods gifted him two elixirs: drinking one would grant him immortality, while drinking both, divinity. Houyi decided to share the elixirs with his beloved wife, Chang’e, so that they may always be together. \n\nBut finally, as Houyi came home to his wife, his jealous apprentice ambushed and killed him in an attempt to steal the elixirs. Enraged and grieving, Chang’e downed both elixirs just as the apprentice reached for them, and began to float towards the heavens. \n\nShe could not bear to be so far from her husband’s resting place, so she landed on the moon, where she has watched the earth from afar ever since. \n\nAnd every night, she dreams of the flower fields of her home. And she dreams of her husband, waiting to welcome her into his arms once more.",
