    "description": "Hirtshals' lighthouse on top of Stenbjerg is the town's beautiful landmark. The lighthouse was opened in 1863 and was constructed in King Frederik VII's time. The king's monogram adorns the tower just above the entrance door. The lighthouse is 35 meter high and has a focal height of 57 meters, meaning the lens is 57 meter above sea. The lighthouse is situated on a cliff 22 meters above sea. Take the 144 steps up the tower and enjoy the stunning views over the Skagerrak and Vendsyssel.",
