    "description": "The beginning of the painting “Root” was created during many live painting performances with Grammy Award Winning World Renowned musicians such as Bob Weir & Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead and Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, Ray Manzarek of The Doors, The Disco Biscuits, Diplo and also was worked on at Alex Grey’s gallery in Chelsea, NY called Chapel of Sacred Mirrors during an event called “Entheocentric Salon”.\n\nOver 13 years of transformation took place before the now digital work of art was featured in a music video on the well-known OWSLA label for a music video featuring Skrillex, Fatman Scoop, SLIINK and Nadus. This mysterious piece of work has also been featured at NY’s most well known electronic music and arts festival, Electric Zoo.\n\n\nEach series in Collection I has: a video version (0,10,20,30), an original version (1,11,21,31) and multiple color activation versions. \n\nEach token comes with different gifts that are redeemed after purchasing. \n\nVisit the [psyriiis website](http://psyriiis.com/) to explore more.",
