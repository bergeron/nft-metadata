    "description": "She appeared to be a weak woman, for all her only duty was to be the companion of the king. Her appearance of a happy woman satisfied with her own life covered her true thoughts. He never agreed with the king's actions, he was leading the kingdom to a chaos without return that would also affect the surrounding kingdoms as a result of the use of dark magic. She would never allow the king's plans to be fulfilled, so she clandestinely began to act together with the best magicians in the kingdom and her 2 sons. The magicians sacrificed themselves to save the other nations, their children would be in charge of saving the kingdom. Queen Alanna was the one who started the long story by saving the lost kingdom of Ovelon. She lives in the forests around the kingdom, protecting the bodies of the sacrificed magicians encased in magic crystals, wishing only that her beloved children achieve their mission.",
