    "description": "Introducing a Limited Edition of 12 NFTs, crafted in April 2023 to commemorate the groundbreaking Ethereum Shapella Upgrade that transpired on April 12th, 2023. This dazzling NFT stars the ingenious Dave Chappelle and the brilliant Vitalik Buterin!\n\nInitially dubbed the Shanghai upgrade for the execution layer and the Capella upgrade for the consensus layer, a serendipitous encounter brought Shanghai and Capella together, igniting a cosmic connectionâ€”thus, Shapella was born!\n\nThe illustrious Shapella signifies the crowning achievement in Ethereum's multi-year metamorphosis from a Proof-Of-Work to a Proof-Of-Stake consensus. At the execution layer, Shanghai unveils a novel transaction type, enabling stakers to withdraw validator balances. Meanwhile, at the consensus layer, Capella paves the way for the Beacon Chain to accommodate withdrawal requests.\n\nFor more NFT Alpha check out www.cryptathon.xyz",
