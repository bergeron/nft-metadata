    "description": "The letterform N is part of the VIRTUAL TYPE RELIEFS collection.\n\n\nVIRTUAL TYPE RELIEFS is a collection that consists of kinetic letterforms, which are built from overlapping 2D line structures. This generates the so-called moiré effect which creates movement and the illusion of depth through which the letterforms take shape. The result is a collection of virtual sculpted typography.",
