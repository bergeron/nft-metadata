    "description": "Confrontations from the beginnings of being, unleash an epic and eternal battle generating an ethical orientation in the characters (Gods, mythical beings, etc.) and in the players who interact with them. \n\nIn this same balance we find that the good and the bad merge in this duality to such an extent that a hero would not be a hero without his heterogeneous villain or antagonist.\n\nYou must make a decision...! you must choose ...! generates chaos in the imbalance.\n\nAlthough, as in life itself, there are not only blacks and whites...! there are also grays.\nChoose your side.\n",
