    "description": "ShaggyBags NostalgiaCrew is a collection of 4200 unique hand drawn characters. Bringing back that Nostalgia feeling in a fun new way with the world of NFTs. Working our hardest to bring value to a Community and grow as big as possible organically. We want to do bigger things and grow the NostalgiaWaves brand. Eventually any NFT from the NostalgiaCrew will double as your membership to exclusive Merch coming in the future and so many more things we have planned, but that is what's confirmed. ShaggyBags was inspired by the fictional character Norville “Shaggy” Rogers in the Scooby-Doo franchise. NostalgiaTalks coming soon. ScoobyBoo is free with the mint of ShaggyBags. Let's get ready. We're taking a ride on the NostalgiaMachine!"
