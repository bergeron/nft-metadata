    "description": "Knave is a heavy metal band formed by guitarist/lead vocalist Evan and bassist/backing vocalist Mason. They, later on, completed the band lineup when drummer Jack and keyboardist Lilith join them.\n\nKnave firstly becomes well known for its aggressive fast-paced music style, or \"thrash metal.\" Then, they started adopting different genres such as nu-metal, deathcore, and rock. Sometimes, they even experiment with a more pop-rock music style.\n\n- Evan Volkov -\n\n8315 x 3142",
