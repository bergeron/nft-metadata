    "description": "「And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day. And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.」\n‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1:6-10‬\n\nThis is the first work I drew in analog. I paired two works at the same time to express the beginning and the end.\nThis work expresses \"the beginning of everything.\n\nWhat do you feel in this work?\n\n\nTools: Acrylic gouache\nSize: F50 (1140mm x 930mm)",
