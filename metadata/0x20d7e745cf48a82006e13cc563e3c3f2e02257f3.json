    "name": "Inferno",
    "description": "Inferno was first released in 1999 as a fan-made map for the original Counter-Strike game.\n\nThe map's layout and design were inspired by a real-life Italian town, giving it a unique and authentic feel. And if you take a moment to look around, you'll notice the colourful buildings that line the streets. \n\nThese vibrant hues add a touch of charm and character to the map, making it all the more enjoyable to explore.",
