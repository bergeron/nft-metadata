    "description": "Two separate, distinct worlds, the Lord of the day and the Master of the night. One does not exist without the other, they are compensation of one another, union and absence, unity and loneliness. Their love is eternal as impossible, a love that has no way, that knows no selfishness. \nBut itâ€™s always the two of them, as one. The Balance of the universe, the balance of existence itself. \n\nI decided to celebrate my birthday by giving to all my collectors this token as a symbol of gratitude, for all the support and strength that you have given me in the last year and a half, thank you because thanks to you I am living my dream",
