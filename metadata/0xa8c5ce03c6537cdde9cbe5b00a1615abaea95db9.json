    "description": "Medusa's still life, a composition of two art styles that i really appreciate: still life and mythologies.\n\nIf a still life usually reflects our edible cravings, I wonder whose still life the freshly severed, still bleeding head of Medusa could be.\n\nDo you have an appetite?\n\nDoes the natural focus of a still life lead you to the inner stillness that, albeit differently, the victims of medusa are also likely to feel?\n\n-Lyrithea",
