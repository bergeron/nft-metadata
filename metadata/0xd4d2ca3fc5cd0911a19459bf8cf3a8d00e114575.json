    "description": "After the success of Lofi Guy Wave 1, I've been debating on how I wanted to go about releasing my first audio only, music NFT.  I ultimately decided, what better way than to simply airdrop it for free as a reward to Lofi Guy NFT holders?!? The power is now in your hands to decide it's worth.\n\nFor me, I see music as a form of escapism. Music that makes you escape to another place or headspace, or music that helps you relax and enjoy the moment. In the same vain, video games do the same for me and millions of others around the world. And that is what this track time is all about.\n\nArtwork by Cody A Banks - Co-Founder of Lofi Guy NFT",
