    "description": "This 1/1 NFT is the first of 4 unique 1/1 NFTs in the Downtown Davinci Project, This is the first drop and we are excited to share this historic moment with you as we start the process of bridging traditional art with digital animations, the link between the real and the virtual. These first four 1/1 animations of my painting “the Mona Lisa on Fire” are being auctioned to help add to a community I have been working on for the past thirty years. 30% of the proceeds from this auction go to a charity to benefit the people of Ukraine. Welcome to the community.",
