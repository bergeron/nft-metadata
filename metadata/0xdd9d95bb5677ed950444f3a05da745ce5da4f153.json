    "description": "A portrait of a Samurai of the Taira Clan just after returning from a grueling and bloody battle during the Siege of Sanjo's Palace.\nEven injured Manaka Shihei remains unmoved and his courage is felt through his aura that emanates from his posture, his eyes and his face.\nFrom my mixed-media series exhibiting the most brave and powerful Warriors ever.\nI mostly use Rembrandt light mood to create powerful portraits with a deep structure.\nI love to imagine the outfits while reading true stories about Japanese Samurai and other people of the Ancient Japan.",
