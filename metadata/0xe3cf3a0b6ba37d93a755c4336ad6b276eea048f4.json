    "description": "The first art work of the new year is a reinterpretation of Crypto Punk #7092 in my doodle style. Aside from simply expressing Crypto Punk, drawing pixels with doodles was a new challenge. Among the numerous shapes, I chose the one I wanted to reinterpret the most and it took more time than I thought. I recorded my thoughts on Crypto Punk, an indispensable part of NFT history, and valuable times of selling art works through NFT in 2021, promoting them to overseas markets, communicating with more foreign artists, and learning a lot.\n\n3334 x 3334px",
