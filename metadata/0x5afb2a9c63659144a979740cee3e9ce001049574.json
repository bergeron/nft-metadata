    "description": "Kicking off my launch with this motion NFT! This NFT was built from my original 46\"x60\" oil painting titled \"Leave What's Heavy Behind\".  The painting was exhibited at the LA Art Fair and explores the freedom we experience when ridding our lives of toxicity.  Owner of this NFT will receive an Archival Signed print of that painting as well as a digital download of this file. Enjoy! ",
