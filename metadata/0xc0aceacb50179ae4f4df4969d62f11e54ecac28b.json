    "description": "Where i'm from we call each other Big Dawg and its used as a synonym for Boss or Homie. Its a term of endearment which says you're a man of high respect. Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, my dream was to become the Big Dawg and take care of my family & friends.\n\nI wrote this song about how it feels to be a boss. I like to think i take charge of my own life and i wanted to embed those feelings into the song so that others can feel the same way I do. The production gets me grooving and the consistently smooth vocals matches the energy and sets the tone from beginning to end. The intro lets the song have time to breathe but when the drums come in you know it's time to dance.",
