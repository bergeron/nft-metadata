    "name": "The Clan of the Stag",
    "description": "The Clan of the Stag harbors the shamanic bloodlines. They revere the Great Stag that is told to reside in the Mistborn Mountains. While their spiritual powers are very reminiscent of arcane sorceries, their power comes solely from the souls of their ancestors and spirits of the otherworld. The Great Stag Clan are the protectors of this world - they keep the otherworld at bay at all costs, never interfering with mortals. As a fully neutral power, they aid all in need, and accept all who wish to join them in their fight against the otherworldly.\n\nIt is told in legends that The Clan of the Stag once fought side by side with their revered protective spirit. Yet, despite it's immense power, even the Great Stag could not withstand a venomous blade from the shadows, commanded by the Deathbringers.",
