    "description": "\"Capsules, shells, stitches, layers\" - is a series of open questions and reflections on my contacts with the environment.\nIt happens every time when I find myself as a part of large human processes trying to realize my identity, my boundaries. An attempt to rethink the experience in new circumstances is like constantly ripping the seam to fit the dress to the new shape of my body.\nHow does it feel when the environment absorbs, denies, cancels, accepts me?\nWho's stronger? Who surrenders?",
