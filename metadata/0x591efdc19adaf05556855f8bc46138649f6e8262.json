    "description": "2022  \n.glb  \nMade with nomad, procreate\n\nPart of Jūrtaka Shrines, a project developed in New Orleans, LA and composed while hiking the Baltic coastal trail. My intention was to create a studio-less process in which I could produce work while hiking 300 km of the Jūrtaka, in Latvia.\n\nThis project was created as part of ASEFFC, an international online/IRL residency which reflects on the precarity and uncertainty that art workers face. And asks “How can we find space for expression and creation in a world of changing circumstances?”\n\nASEFCC was curated by Maija Rudovska and the greater project was supported by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Latvian Culture Capital Foundation, Arts Council Norway, Viken County Municipality, U.S. Embassy in Latvia.\n\nT:@davegreber  \nIG:@davaygrebere  \nwww.thesculpted.com  \nwww.asefcc.org",
