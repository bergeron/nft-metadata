    "description": "Next time you feel discouraged and you are tempted to doubt the wisdom, love and watch care of God, think of the sunshine and clouds. When clouds blot the bright beams of the sun from reaching your window, do you doubt the sun is still there?  \nNo! Even though you can't see it, you know that the sun is still there but just that the clouds are veiling its bright rays.  \nWhen the clouds of the enemy overshadow us, we mustn't doubt Righteousness still watches over us. By the eye of faith we must pierce through believing that the MESSENGERS  are watching above",
