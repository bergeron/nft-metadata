    "description": "2014 New York City - \"Snowfall\" is a 1/1 from the first time I got to meet & photograph with Monica. The location was a loft right off Spring & Mercer with a fire escape overlooking the street. As we started our shoot inside the snow began to fall outside. There is definitely something to be said about being in the right place at the right time, especially during the start of a snowstorm. Seeing this we both knew it was too good of a creative opportunity to not pass up. We stepped out on the balcony and began to shoot. Monica handled the cold amazingly allowing me to make 2 photosets during this. But usually there is one photography that can sum up an entire shoot and this is that picture. From the atmosphere , to the framing, to her look into my lens... this is the frame where it all came together. ",
