    "description": "Let's turn to the human being - the most beautiful creature our world has to offer! \nIt is a well-known fact that in ancient times, the human being was worshiped more than ever.  \nAncient Greek and Roman gods were, in fact, human given their passions and sins. \nThe human body was regarded as a work of art!\n\nA human movement in the context of a city is in effect в a fleeting momentum that will never reoccur. \nJust like light and shadow are elusive in our everyday life, so is every move of a human being - elusive, fleeting and irretrievable.  \nHuman beings in the city without the city. \nFrozen sculptures.",
