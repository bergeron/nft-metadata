    "description": "\"I am tired, I am weary\nI could sleep for a thousand years\nA thousand dreams that would awake me\nDifferent colors made of tears\"\n\nInspired by the song Venus in Furs by The Velvet Underground, I wanted to do a surreal portrait that is reminiscent of the song. This was created by generating  several pieces in AI (Dream by WOMBO) and using SketchBook app to collage pieces and make hand-drawn edits. "
