    "description": "Introducing Valentine, a Ukrainian war refugee who is now residing in London with his mother and younger sister. Valentine and I have created a powerful and emotional collection of art pieces to raise money for Ukrainian war refugees (donating to charities) and for Valentine to support his family in this difficult time. 50% of the profits will be donated to a Ukrainian charity of his choice, the remainder will go to Valentine. Our art pieces aim to represent the power and hope in the struggles of war and our activism against it. Art is powerful and a signature of truth in time, we hope with ours we can inspire others and be part of a good change. ",
