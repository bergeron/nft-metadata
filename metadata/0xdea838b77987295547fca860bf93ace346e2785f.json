    "description": "In a world of cyberpunk, technology has advanced to the point where humans can create crazy things. With this new world come new dangers- and Bugs Bunny is the only one who can see them. In this chaotic and glitchy landscape, Bugs Bunny is the only one who can save us from ourselves.\n\nWhen you see Bugs Bunny going crazy, it's the glitch in our Matrix. This eye-catching artwork depicts a cyberpunk world gone mad, with all of the technology and chaos taking its toll on poor Bugs. It's a warning to us all that we might be headed for the same fate if we're not careful!",
