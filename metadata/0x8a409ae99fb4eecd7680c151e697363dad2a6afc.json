    "description": "The work of Manuel Fois feeds on the experience of environmental sound, representing, reworking and capturing it in physical form.\nIn this process of environmental recording in open places, he uses complex receptive structures composed of dozens of long-range microphones and a sensory platform.\nCapturing the sound of atmospheric events such as wind or rain, the multi-track recording is then processed into a 3d form or returned within an 'ambient sound exhibit.\nSound becomes a description of an environment through the process of perception, Fois seeks to actively involve the user in his investigations, and this gives his production a conceptual-processual scope. The simultaneity of absence and presence, of past and present, and the link between work and story produce an experience of archiving that is continually renewed.",
