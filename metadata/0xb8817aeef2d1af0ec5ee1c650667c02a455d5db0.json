    "description": "In the misty time of the morning, realizing a feeling that you think is miraculous. but Bukowski interpreted it as love. ''Love is kind of like when you see a fog in the morning, when you wake up before the sun comes out. It’s just a little while, and then it burns away… Love is a fog that burns with the first daylight of reality.'' I find this feeling close to love and mysterious. that's why I wanted to quote Bukowsky.",
