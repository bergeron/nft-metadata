    "series_brief": "Transcendental Spheres depicts an imaginary but attainable future in which women are at the forefront. While surreal, these dreamscapes represent an aspirational paradise deeply rooted in visual harmony and Sacred Femininity. These are worlds in which one can escape and reimagine oneself, where power is sourced from within, and our spheres of influence have no boundaries. The physical works and NFTs that comprise this collection are meant to alter one's perspective between still and moving images as well as various forms. From physical works inspired by vintage fashion to digital NFTs inspired by surrealist landscapes to custom relief paintings, this collection depicts worlds where the line between what is natural and artificial begins to blur.",
