    "description": "I am still amazed by the fact that colors do not exist and that what we perceive is only the impression that is produced in our brain when interpreting electromagnetic wavelengths. Perhaps the reason why I paint is to ask myself about some phenomena that we have naturalized.\nIn chemistry, litmus is used to indicate the Ph of a substance: it changes color depending on its acidic or basic character. This series of paintings has helped me understand how light falls on surfaces and screens. Playing with the wrinkles of the paper and returning it to a flat condition, I ask myself questions about different technical and theoretical aspects of the pictorial exercise an the digital image.\n",
