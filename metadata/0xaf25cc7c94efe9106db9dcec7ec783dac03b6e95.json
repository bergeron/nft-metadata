    "description": "Every winter in the Canadian Rockies as temperatures drop below freezing, methane bubbles become entrapped in the ice, frozen in varying depths and patterns beneath the surface of the water. \n\nStrong wind gusts are often prevalent in this area and make for a challenging environment as frigid wind chills reach as low as -50 degrees celsius. But the winds also keep the ice devoid of snow resulting in a polished and smooth surface that reveals thousands of bubbles, and frozen cracks leading the eye to the most incredible mountain backdrops.  \n\nAnd when conditions align just right, chinooks create the most extraordinary clouds that catch light and reflect on the bubbles below, turning this winter wonderland into a world of fire and ice.\n\nAn image captured from Abraham Lake in Nordegg, Alberta, Canada\n\n",
