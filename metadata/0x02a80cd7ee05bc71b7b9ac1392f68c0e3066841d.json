Blood lazily doused him with vomit and waste, with images long discarded, all worn, tattered, warped, scorched, melted, shattered, eaten up with rust, rotted, soiled, bacterial-eaten and filled with imaginary horror. Now he sat with his face buried in this abomination, and his fear turned into a huge disgusting Something that gutted, gulped him without a trace, and filled again. Filled with something new, something that had been denied up to this point and hidden in the rotting cellars of the soul.\n\n",
