But behind the brightly colored tents and the laughter of the crowds, there are those who perform who are hiding a deeper sadness. The clowns, with their painted faces and exaggerated expressions, are the embodiment of this dichotomy. They bring joy to others, but their own souls are heavy with sorrow.",
