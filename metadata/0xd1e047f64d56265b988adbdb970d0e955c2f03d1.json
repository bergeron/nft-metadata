    "description": "One Sunday morning at 4 o'clock, Robbie - my cat - decides to wake up and eat his kibble noisily... As I dream, a melody and a scene come to mind.\n\n--\n\n\"In the still of night, when slumber reigns supreme,\nA feline form awakens from its peaceful dream.\nWith stealthy steps it creeps, towards its daily feast,\nIts soft mews echoing, in a symphony of the least.\n\nThe master still lies sleeping, undisturbed by the sound,\nBut in his dreaming mind, the music can be found.\nFor every crunch and purr, that the cat does make,\nA strange and wondrous melody, in the master's head does wake.\n\nIt builds and grows, with each munch of kibble fair,\nA concerto of the night, that fills the air.\nThe beat of pads and whiskers, a rhythm all its own,\nA sonata of the cat, that's never heard by dawn.\n\nAnd when the cat has eaten, and returns to bed,\nThe master stirs and wonders, what the music he's just heard.\nA fleeting dream, a memory, that fades with every light, Of a cat's serenade, in the dead of night.\"",
