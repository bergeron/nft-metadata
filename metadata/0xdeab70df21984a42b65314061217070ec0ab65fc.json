    "description": "Decided to spend my 22nd birthday at Rye beach in the south of the UK, 27 degrees and a lovely breeze. We found a spot on the dunes where it was quiet, had a nap and fish and chips. As the sun got lower and the beach got emptier we decided to play around with the new 85 lens. Then decided to cool down in the sea which Vienna absolutely loved and wanted to be in every picture. A sweet couple saw us taking pictures and sat in the distance observing with a glass of wine, they had their own private sunset show of us giggling and frolicking around.  ",
