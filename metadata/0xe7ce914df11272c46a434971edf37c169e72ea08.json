    "description": "Tribe is the visual love letter I speak to myself and to the women in my life that anchor, uphold and inspire me, who are my ledger of moral accountability, who are fuel to my curiosity and creative inspiration, who demand truthfulness with myself first and always, and who inform the weave and weft of the fabric of my very being. \n\nI am not here without them. \n\nI am not who I am without them. \n\nAnd my love for them has allowed me to find love for myself and a far greater love for this life than I could ever possibly imagine. \n\nLove is practiced. It is nothing more than a nice idea if it is not threaded into the fabric of our being and our actions every day. Love is often learned in the face of suffering. In present times we know this to be true. We know the totality of our interconnectedness when it is wrested from us.\n\nTribe is love requited, affirmed and in perpetual motion of expression and reciprocity. ",
