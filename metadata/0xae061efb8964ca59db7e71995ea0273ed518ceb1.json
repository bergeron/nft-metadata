    "description": "In this 30-second video, you'll see a dynamic cube that has been generated using JavaScript. The cube is made up of smaller cubes that respond to the background music, moving and changing form as they radiate out from the center. The cubes are placed on a cyber-style opaque glass card, allowing you to see both the cubes and the action happening in the background.\n\nVISUAL: [likemurvin](https://twitter.com/LikeMurvin)\nMUSIC: [violet7rip](https://twitter.com/violet7rip)",
