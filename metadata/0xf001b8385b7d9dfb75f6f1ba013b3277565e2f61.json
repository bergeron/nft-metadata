    "description": "Untitled Faces is the first collection of unique NFT artworks by traditional artist Léonard Combier. He will release more faces with different specificities in the next months.\n\nHis work is like a riddle that can never quite be solved. Something always slips your notice or escapes your eye, resisting your attempt to unravel every clue. Indeed, the young French artist’s imagination runs so wild that each of his works is a world unto itself.\n\nThe animated faces are made with a multitude of hand drawn elements, assembled then animated.\nThe static faces will come along with a high quality print on dibond, hand-signed by the artist.",
