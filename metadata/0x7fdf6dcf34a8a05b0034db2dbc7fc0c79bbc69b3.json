    "description": "'Rise' is Token #1  minted on my own custom smart contract (Nov 2021) and tells the first chapter of the story of Face Rock and how its geology was formed off the coast of Oregon.\n\nAll three images in this series were made on the same evening back in October of 2018, and was an important trip for the development of my photography path and future as an Artist so it was fitting to release 'Rise' as my Token #1 of my Genesis Series.\n\n----------\n\nThe Story of Face Rock Part 1: \n\nAs the Nah-So-Mah tale of Face Rock is told - Ewauna, the daughter of the great Chief Siskiyou always dreamt of visiting old Wecoma, the sea. She would stare off towards the horizon and imagine how the clouds would form, making the arduous journey to her home high up in the mountains.\n\nHer day would come when her father was invited by the four tribes of the coast to celebrate the Chinook Moon. This was an important occasion to the people of the coast so a grand potlatch was thrown and the five tribes feasted and gave tribute well into the night.\n\nStories of the dark spirit Seatka were passed around the fire, telling of people who would go into the waters of Wecoma never to return.  Ewauna laughed at those warnings of the old men and later slipped away from the sleeping camp to experience great Wecoma herself.\n\nReaching the beach with her dog Komax and basket of kittens, Ewauna took her first-ever step into the sand, letting the grains flow through her toes and breathing in the smell of the fresh briny air.\n\nThen Ewauna ran.  And she danced. And she sang under that full moon, basking in its light, completely entranced by the beauty of old Wecoma, unaware of the trap that was laid.\n\nSoon the cool touch of water was felt under her feet. Ewauna, unable to resist, dropped her basket and ran out into the abnormally calm waters, leaving Komax alone on the beach to worry about his master.\n\nUnaware of how far she had drifted from shore, it wasn't until the moon was covered by the great shadow of Seatka that Ewauna knew it was too late to rise from the sea.",
