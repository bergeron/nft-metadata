    "description": "\"They call him, “The Modern Prometheus”. They say he’s trying to create the perfect organism, trying to find the ‘Ascendency Strain’. He’s splicing together different parts, from different creatures, like a fucked up Pick ’n’ Mix… and guess who’s next…\n\nI’d say you’re fucked, mate!\"\n\n‘Prometheus Lab’ is a narrative-driven, art-focussed project from the warped mind of digital artist, Waxbones; powered by Props – the team behind all your favourite PFP projects! Not just another generative project, Prometheus Lab puts creation in the hands of the collector, allowing you to swap out sections of your ‘Abomination’ through a re-roll feature… but once you hit that re-roll, there’s no going back!",
