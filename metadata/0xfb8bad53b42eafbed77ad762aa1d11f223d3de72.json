    "description": "The first artwork of the \"Inner palette\" series describes the process of a new meeting with disintegrated parts of our personalities. Sometimes to become a whole person, we need to path a long way with struggles, frustrations, separations, and depression. \n\nThrough dancing, visual and sound art, we want to immerse the viewers into the inner world and find TRUE yourselves. It might be an exciting journey into those coordinates of reality in which you want to be.\nCreated by an international team using a \"Reverse\" idea in choreography and sound to emphasize the moment where past and present intersect. \n\nCollectors will be provided with the high-quality version of the video: 2764x3456 (4K), HDR\n\nChoreography: Irina Angles\nVideo Artist: Alessio Dispenza (backinasec)\nCinematographer: Anton Kolomiiets\nSound artist: FAAF",
