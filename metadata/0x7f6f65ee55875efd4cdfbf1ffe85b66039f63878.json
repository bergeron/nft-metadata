    "description": "\"Pia could be called the spiritual sequel to the SON project, and marks a new era and search for hope in the Trump/COVID19 reality. This time, my daughter, Pia, is the protagonist and muse, and the backdrop was our family’s return to Paris (my wife is French and my children are half-French).\n\nThe images portray a father-daughter relationship, but they are equally about the nature of the relationship between photographer and subject and the role of collaboration as Pia takes control of her character. The passage of time comes with a certain melancholy, but also a declaration of hope that guides the photographs.\n\nWhile making these images, I thought often of this quote by Robert Adams:\n\n'Are there scenes in life, right now, for which we might conceivably be thankful? Is there a basis for joy or serenity, even if felt only occasionally? Are there grounds now and then for an unironic smile? Every artist and would-be artist should, I think, recognize a responsibility to try, without lying, to answer those questions with a \"yes\"'.\" - Christopher Anderson \n\nEdition: 1 of 1",
