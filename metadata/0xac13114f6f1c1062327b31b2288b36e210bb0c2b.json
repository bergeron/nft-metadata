    "name": "Cardi B's Star Chart",
    "description": "Born on a full moon, Cardi B is a crackling powder keg of creativity. Her chart shows dynamic, sizzling star power. It is rife with oppositions and squares, making a pattern called a cross. Trials and traumas hurled her way. Yet, like an ever-bubbling hot spring, there’s also abundant, quaking power, which Queen Cardi wields with both hands. She’s faced strife like a warrior and broken it like a wild horse—harnessing Libra energy to calibrate, balance and soar. \n\nAmid prickly textures and turbulent heat flairs along crosses and squares, beauty reigns. Close bonds are her lodestone. Artistic water energy is most present: saturated aquamarines, moody ceruleans. Mama bear heat. A deep lens. Venusian vivacity invites glam incarnations of vigorous energies: pastels and royal purples, amped up by high-gloss materials, meet deliberate brushstrokes. Tones opposite the color wheel abut, punctuating contrasts. Like Cardi herself, it bursts with vitality.\n\nWatercolor, acrylic, rice on paper. 1of1",
