    "description": "\"The other side of Paradise\" It is a work painted entirely in Photoshop. It is painting number one of a series of paintings that I have in my mind and in my head for a long time. To tell the truth I got the impulse when in the last days I saw akira and other movies about the cyberpunk genre.  \n\nI am fascinated by the idea of a technological world and all that entails to be able to obtain mechanical parts or for example... cyberarms. But at the same time I am terrified to think about the phrase \"High tech, Low life\" . \n\nEventually the dystopian future is very close to being like the movies. But if there is one thing for sure, it is that low life exists today. That's why this series is inspired by my friends, my close people, the neighbors of my town .... my country maybe. \n\nA big hug to my beloved Argentina. \nAnd thanks to my girlfriend for allowing me to use her body as a reference for this painting. \n\nAnd remember escape the void. \n\nPNG format. \n4500X5713 pxs.",
