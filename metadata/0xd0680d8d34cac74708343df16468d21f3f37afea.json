    "description": "Prove You Wrong\n\nA sweeter feeling than falling in love would be proving you wrong. \n\nAnother personal favorite written by alt-pop artist YUNICE and Jordan Yaeger, Prove You Wrong depicts the fragile and fleeting states of human romance. \n\nYUNICE\ntwitter @yunicemusic\nIG @yunice.music\n\nLyrics:\nYou will never notice\nThe hope that you slaughtered\nThe energy you take\nThe love that you stomp on\nYou will never see it\nWhat everyone makes so easy\nI could not jump over\n\nBut I’m not scared to ask for this\nI’m the one who got lost in bliss\nI’m the one who will not be missed\n\nYou said I needed you more than you’re willing to front\nYou could be right, \nYou could be right\nNow let me prove you wrong\nThe trouble with love is its fleeting so fast then its gone\nYou’d rather be right\nYou’d rather be right\nBut let me prove you wrong\n\nI want you to see it\nThe room of the darkness\nThe silence of my grief\nThe melody of fear\nCould you ever sense it?\nThe part of your heart that’s gone missing\nIs so glad to be abandoned\n\nBut I’m the one who had wanted this\nI’m the one who cannot resist\nI’m the one who will fight for this\n\nYou said I needed you more than you’re willing to front\nYou could be right, \nBut what if you’re wrong?\nThe trouble with love is its fleeting so fast then its gone\nYou’d rather be right\nYou’d rather be right\nBut let me prove you wrong\n\nMusic by Eunice Wong, Jordan Yaeger\nArtwork by Eunice Wong",
