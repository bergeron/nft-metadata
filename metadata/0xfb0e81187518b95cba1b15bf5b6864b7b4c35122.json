    "description": "Salut, Ma Belle (‘Hello, beautiful’ - translated from English to French) is a collection of 9 images of the female body in various poses to depict sensuality. \nIt is an internal conversation with oneself as a way to have a deeper connection with ourselves by redefining what sexy means, and what it feels like more than what it looks like. When we are connected with our sexuality and sensuality, we are developing, understanding and reclaiming parts of ourselves we lost to whatever trauma, society, culture, or religion that held control over us.\nThe collection was created to honour and celebrate the woman’s sensuality. The collection is a call to recognise sensuality for what it truly is—a powerful life force within us all.  Harness sensuality to create a deeper connection to ourselves, to others, and as a portal to greater creativity and confidence.\n\n1/1 NFT\n*Not for commercial use. ",
