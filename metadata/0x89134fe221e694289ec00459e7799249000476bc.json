    "description": "I have created wearable Yeezy Slides in Enflame Orange for your Ape *or ANYONE* in the Metaverse, FBX/OBJ included with compatability airdrops for Otherside once SDK is unlocked. Only 1,000 Pairs to be released, ever. The adidas Yeezy Slide Enflame Orange updates the minimalist slip-on with a deep citrus hue. The lightweight build, formed with injected EVA, features breathable open-toe construction and a plush footbed for soft landings. The latter is marked with adidas three-stripe logo, representing the only bit of exterior branding. Pronounced flex grooves distinguish the outsole, offering improved cushioning and durable traction.",
