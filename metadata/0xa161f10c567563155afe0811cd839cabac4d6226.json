    "description": "The Garden/Against The World Music Video was directed by Elis Lindsten based in Stockholm.\nElis Lindsten is a 17 year old visual artist, director and voice actor based in Stockholm, Sweden with an eye for the future as well as the past. His art always breathes retro futurism whether he is working on a short film or an abstract visualizer on VHS. The symbolic and subtle language is a common tool in his craftsmanship and the border of what people expect is pushed on every project. Dramatic color palettes, haze and grittiness are some signature elements often found in his art. At the age of 8, he found the world inside the lens for the first time, at the age of 13, he won his first film price at BUFF international film festival and today at the age of 17, he is working on projects with artists like David Guetta, Angie and Harrison First. After 3 months of intense work, The Garden / Against the World has become his first ever NFT project and interaction with the the 3rd web.\n",
