    "description": "Artist: Toni Payne  \nTitle: Still Life with Berries (2020)  \nMedium: Digital Photograph\n\nThe Golden Age of Still Life Art started in the 17th Century, but Still Life Art can be found as far back as the 15th century BCE where paintings of food were painted by Egyptians in burial sites. Still Life Art has been used for centuries to tell a story of the times, using everyday items. In contemporary times, these stories are still being told using a variety of mediums. \n\nI explore Still Life Art using Photography.  I also play, in my usual style, with light and shadows to create a dynamic composition. Still Life with Berries is a vibrant arrangement that depicts some of preferred fruits of our time.\n\n---  \nThere is only 1 NFT of this Artwork. \nThis artwork is also available as a limited edition run Physical Print.
