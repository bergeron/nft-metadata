    "description": "I found myself capturing more night scenes after the birth of my daughter. It wasnâ€™t an intentional shift, but a necessity since this was the only time I could consistently get out to shoot. I quickly fell in love with the quiet, melancholy scenes offered by nightfall. It fits my personality. Similar to how a landscape photographer might describe solo hikes to beautiful vistas, this became a relaxing, meditative time for me.\n\nI especially look forward to the big storms that roll through the city each winter - still do! Only a few brave souls move about the city. This is my absolute favorite time to walk the streets. The falling snow makes the city feel small, and Chicago never feels more like itself.",
