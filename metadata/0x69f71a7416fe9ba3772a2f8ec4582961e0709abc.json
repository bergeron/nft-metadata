    "description": "i wrote ‘Default’ after a conversation with a friend where i realized i had been changing myself for someone i thought i loved. ‘Default’ is about fighting the feeling of shape shifting for someone else - but also how addicting it is trying to be everything to everyone. \n\n‘Default’ is the last single before my second EP releases in november. the golden egg winner will receive a 1/1 piece of merch and tickets to one of my upcoming headlining shows.\n\nwritten by ben kessler, sean cook, karissa bone\nproduced by sean cook\nartwork by josefine cardoni",
