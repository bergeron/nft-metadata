    "name": "King's Triumph",
    "description": "The crash and scrape of iron on steel, the ragged shouts of the desperate, and a king rising above the rabble. This is war, and only one can triumph.\n\nThis is the first 1/1 in a series of images in a similar style, from a collection that I have spent over a year developing and perfecting. Each month, just one black and white SKETCH will be released, and just one full-color PAINTing. This sketch marks the beginning of the series, and is my first publicly available mint on Foundation.\n\nOwners of a SKETCH will always have first dibs to buy the matching PAINT version of them, at the floor price of the PAINT collection, no bidding required.\n\nAfter a 24 hour window, un-bought PAINTings will switch to open auction if the sketch owner does not claim them.",
