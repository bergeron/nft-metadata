    "description": "Stonetown is like no other city I've seen in Tanzania. The capital of Zanzibar Island was built as a large slave-trading hub by the Omani Empire, who controlled the entire Swahili Coast for centuries. The slave trade was a huge business here run mainly by Arabs and local Muslims, and it only ended 100 years ago. These days Tanzania is mainly a Christian country, but the coast and especially Zanzibar Island remain mostly Muslim. So Stonetown turned out to be at the crossroads of cultures, the Arab influence is most striking here, but colonial European and modern African influences are also noticeable. Now the markets of this city are selling food and household items instead of slaves, and the island itself has become an international tourist destination, but deep in the backstreets of Stonetown this mixed atmosphere of despair and tropical euphoria is still felt.\n\nStonetown, Tanzania // Aug 2021",
