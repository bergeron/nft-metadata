    "description": "The mind occupied with the mundane daily routine begins to take the shape and form of those material items. Some days, the sun shines and some relief is felt but there is always a shadow. A realization that the items actually rule life and freedom is merely a concept that is out of reach. Is it any relief at all?\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis is an Open Edition that will remain open to infinity, or as long as the platform allows. Burn-Redeem capabilities will be cyclical.",
