    "description": "This series is made of 3 kinds of painting: oil on canvas by Mikey Woodbridge, makeup on skin by Francesco Cascavilla and light on silicon by the two of us together.\n\nWith PAINTED, we wanted to find a way to bring Mikey's canvases to life in a digital form without losing the power of their physical presence. We created interactions between the canvas and the body to transform the two-dimensional image into a place.\n\nWe paint a world for ourselves -  a canvas to wear, a face to look out from and a digital image to invite the others in.",
