    "description": "Paris 8 eme 2019 16th October  - Gokhan Gokcay \n\nIn \"Rainy Boulevard\", we see a man in a black suit walking purposefully down a wet Parisian street, his head held high and his body language exuding confidence. Despite the rain and the dreary weather, he appears undaunted, his footsteps sure and steady as he navigates the slick pavement. The blurred effect of the photograph adds to the dreamlike quality of the scene, as if the city is melting away around him and he is the only one left standing. Through the use of black and white, the image captures the essence of Paris as a city of romance and sophistication, but also reveals a certain grit and determination that lies just beneath the surface. \"Rainy Boulevard\" is a celebration of perseverance and the ability to find beauty even in the midst of life's storms.",
