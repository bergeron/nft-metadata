    "description": "Throughout my life, overthinking and self-doubt has been a recurring theme - mostly to do with releasing music - as well as navigating relationships. While pursuing a career in music as well as going through mental hardship, a song about my mental state seemed to be the most effective in expressing my emotions. While I could have left this vision on my hard drive, I felt there would be other people in the world who could use this song as motivation to fight those harmful thoughts that they may be having. \n\n\"What if we had faith in everything working out\"\n\nThank you to the people who have been in my corner when things weren't looking exactly light. \n \nThank you to Quicho - who shot + edited + directed this video, as well as Francis Kemper for helping this all come together.",
