    "description": "It was in the times of the first pandemic, where caution and restrictions made us look for isolated places to spend the summer.\n\nOne morning I was scouting for locations to shoot in the plains of Bourgogne, where an open gate led me to this solitary tree. The early morning sun was clearing up the sky above, and the tree appeared like a survivor, unbending in the face of the passing clouds.\n\nI set my camera for a 5 minutes long exposure, trying to capture the image of the immovable tree witnessing the passage of time. I was on my way home where the black frame finished processing, and seeing the result reminded me that no matter how difficult the times, the power to see it thru lies within us.",
