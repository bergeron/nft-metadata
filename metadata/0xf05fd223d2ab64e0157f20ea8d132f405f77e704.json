    "description": "Prince Eheneden Erediauwa was crowned the 39th Oba of Benin kingdom \"Oba Ewuare ll Nâ€™Ogidigan.\"\n\nDuring coronation which had many dignitaries in attendance, the Oba and his three wives were seen covering their mouths with a white handkerchief and this got many people wondering why.\n\nThe reason why Oba of Benin and his queens covered their mouths with handkerchief are:\n\n1. According to Benin tradition, Oba of Benin is the Monarch of Benin Kingdom, the Oba's teeth is considered sacred, it should not be seen in public.\n\n2. He must not eat in public, no one must see him chewing his mouth and that makes him different from other people.\n\n3. The Oba's wives cover their mouths as a sign of submission.\n\n4. His wives are never allowed to visit their parents.\n\n5. Oba usually covers his mouth because when he talks he is the supreme authority and whatever he says is final( does not talk too much).\n\nThe kids played the scene of this coronation during the cultural day celebration.",
