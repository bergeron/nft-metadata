    "description": "over the last year i’ve probably been on the worst sleep schedule of my life. it’s definitely made the days harder than they need to be, but for good reason, i haven’t been able to fix it. this song is one of the many that’s kept me up at night. i started writing this one at 4am back in april while my roommate was dead asleep. i had my acoustic guitar out and two chords recorded using the mic built into my macbook. i wrote/recorded all the verses within a few minutes. it honestly came together way too quickly and way too imperfectly perfect. i then spent the entire next day (after waking up at 1pm of course) producing out the entire song and constantly thinking to myself “wow this is so sad but so sick”\nthis song is so simple, yet so special and you’ll feel it when listening.\nhope you dig <3\n\nwritten by Peter Saputo\nproduced by Peter Saputo\nmixed by Yianni Anastos-Prastacos\nmastered by Théo Quayle",
