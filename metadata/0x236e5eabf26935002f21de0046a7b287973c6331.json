    "description": "This is a collaged design of Henri Matisse's dance on the Freedom Tower\nAt the top of this image, the slogan \"women.life.freedom\" is written in Farsi\nThe five characters are walking hand in hand in a ring, but on the left, we can see that the two persons’ hands are divided;Because the point of the rupture is closest to the viewer’s location, it might be taken as an invitation to engage in the dance.\n“It is rare to dare to use collages of naked designs in persian arts” \nAlso, many articles about this work of art have been published\nthe Guardian(uk)-ART DE VIVRE(fr)-die zeit(de)",
