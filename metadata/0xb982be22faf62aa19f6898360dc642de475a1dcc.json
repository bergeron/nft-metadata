    "description": "I hired my good friend Eden who is a photographer but also a chef, producer, traveler, lover of life, and all-around amazing woman to assist me on this shoot. Here we were staying and shooting in the little casitas of the surf hotel Playa Negra in Guanacaste. \n\nEden loves hummingbirds and she had just recently added the tattoos you see to her arm. As I cleaned up this Imacon scan I loved to see the sharpness and detail in Eden's face and the slight movement of her knee due to likely a 30th of a second exposure.\n\nThis was my first big travel shoot and (though I am still the same today) I was up almost every sunrise so excited to shoot. This image was captured with my 4x5 Wista field camera. I bought the Wista from a camera store (Calumet) that no longer exists in San Francisco to use as my first pro camera out of college once I started shooting editorial assignments. I quickly learned that the 4x5 was going to be too slow for most of my work, so after a time, I added the 6x7 system. ",
