    "description": "Unlike more traditional forms of generative art, this collection is not based on one code specifically designed to produce lines or curves but is the result of mixing various algorithms where each produces a predetermined type of graphics. The enormous advantage of this system is an infinity of variables that can be intermingled to give surprising results, always maintaining that wonderful characteristic of generative art of achieving unpredictable and surprising results.",
