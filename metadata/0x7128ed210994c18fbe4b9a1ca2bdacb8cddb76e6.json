Its hard to imagine there was a time before ghouls, when times were good. The worlds were not the way they are today. The timelines were pure and unblemished. Throughout all time and place things were innocent allowing peace.  \n  But there was an evil rising, gaining power. All set in motion by Drall at the behest of Morgoth. An infection of the mind was taking place. Turning normie brains to mush and the dead couldnt die. This infection set in motion the great power shift that gave rise to the ghouls. \n Poor Drall didnt know what he was doing when he market bought for our sins. He was innocent in his actions. But it was his actions that brought forth the evil that we are encountered with today. The bones of the wicked risen from their graves.",
