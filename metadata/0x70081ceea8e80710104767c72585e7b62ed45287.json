    "description": "This artwork is in jpeg format with the size of 400x400mm.\n\nAbout the scene: This is a scene from a post-catastrophic world where only uncle species live. In this new order, uncles fight, make love, earn money and piss on fires. They love, they lose, they fight, they rejoice, they laugh, they fear, they struggle, they do sports, music, art, and they fight again. They show their presence in every aspect in this toxic and radioactive world, where new life forms arise on the old remains.\n\nThere are two different kind of uncles in the scene: on the center there is a fish-uncle and a humanoid uncle catching him with his bare hands.
