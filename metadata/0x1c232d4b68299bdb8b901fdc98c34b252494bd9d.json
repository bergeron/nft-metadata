    "description": "I took this photo on a trip to my family's hometown on a small island in Greece called Limnos. It was taken on one of my last nights there and I had been hoping to capture a sunset photo overlooking the Aegean Sea, just like this one. \n\nWhilst eating dinner at a restaurant along the water, I noticed the conditions were just right for such a photo. I quickly devoured what was left of my food and walked a few steps to the edge of the water to set up my camera and take the shot. And this is what I got.\n\nThis photo represents the beauty and tranquility of one of the lesser known islands in Greece.",
