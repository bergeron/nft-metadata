    "description": "I made this doll and mini stop-motion in conjunction with Mr. Misang's contest. The doll is the character of a ghost wearing a blue suit.  The concept of this item is the fun of childhood fantasies where we tend to have our imaginary little friends hiding everywhere. \n\nIf you are the winner of the auction I will send  a little ghost doll to your home, please don’t remember to send your home address to me when you win the auction.\n\nThank you \n\nThis work was a submission for Mr. Misang’s contest as a member of the Ghost Project Contest Community.",
