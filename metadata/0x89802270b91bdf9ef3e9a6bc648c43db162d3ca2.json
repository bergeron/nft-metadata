    "description": "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world\nLife in plastic, it's fantastic\nYou can brush my hair, undress me everywhere\nImagination, life is your creation\n\nA combination of ethereal settings, with unnerving characters swallow you in my DREAMWORLDS series. Originally created as a form of escapism from my depression, these digital paintings have become a representation of what it feels like to dream, and live, with a mental health condition.",
