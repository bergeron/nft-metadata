    "description": "Silhouettes is a series of photographs I created between 2016 and 2020, using the technique of double exposure on film, shooting two photos on the same part of the film, allowing me to merge a silhouette of someone and a landscape/cityscape creating a surreal, dreamlike effect.\n\nThis series is about finding our place in this world, but more so creating it. The duality of our inner world and the outside world, often colliding. I wanted to represent how asÂ individuals we are part of something bigger than ourselves.",
