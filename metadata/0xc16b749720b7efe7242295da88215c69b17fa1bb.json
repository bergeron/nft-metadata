    "description": "This specifically is the foundation photo to the whole series. having such unique looping facade with light structure, Deutsches Haus is one of the most majestic building in Saigon, Vietnam especially at night time.\n\nThis photograph was a look up shot capturing the moment in midnight just right after all the window lights were turned off which left this building absent before it completely shutted down the structure lights. For that giving this shot a smooth pattern without having defect lightings from the windows.\n\nAbout the personal statement for, I aimed to make this shot having the futuristic vibes from Tron Legacy in term of lighting and cinematic color palette inspired by The Matrix movie.\n\nCaptured Photograph (3654 × 4567 | 300x300 dpi) \n ",
