    "description": "<Moulin Ether>\n\nAn homage Moulin Rouge, La Goulue by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, one of my favorite artists. \n\nSince it was his first graphic poster, I decided to drop it as the first one in the <All the Classics> collection. As an illustrator and a graphic designer, the layout of his poster works and the bold touches of the outline amazes me the most. \n\nThe cancan dancer and the lover are described as cats, and the people in the back are also replaced with the silhouette of animals. \n\nI hope it takes you back in the days with the sound to create the atmosphere of the ballroom.\n\n00:00:12:00",
