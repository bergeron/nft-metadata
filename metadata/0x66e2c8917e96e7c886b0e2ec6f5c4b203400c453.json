    "description": "Argo the Puppy was designed for my fundraiser project to support dogs and animals from the wildfires of 2021 in Greece. I stenciled it and tattooed it a few hundred times on really cool supporters of the cause . after running for 154 days i managed to raise enought money and donate them to DogsVoice NPO that i know of and have a personal opinion regarding where the money goes and how they treat and rescue even \"lost cases\" . Check them out they totally deserve it! \nAs for Argo (originally is the sketch of my gone best mate) Argo (originally was the name of the loyal dog of  odysseus that waited for him to return to Ithaka after 20 years in the sea...was the one that recognized him at  first glance ..approached and died on his feet. he was really old but loyal AF ..\nArgo the puppy ...patreon of strays !\nI m going to create as many \"Argos\"  continue supporting Dogsvoice ...the ones that you are too far away from my studio @santatintagreece ...you could try bidding for a 1/1 NFT\nthank u!\n",
