    "description": "I used a full-sized mannequin to do this stop animation in my studio in 2020 (showcasing a 2-face mask that I sculpted/painted). I would have preferred to do a much smaller scale, but I have too much amazing wardrobe and wouldnt be able to duplicate \"the look\" of an authentic vintage piece of clothing. So, after hours of sweating (it was quite a workout to move a giant mannequin and clouds), this is the outcome- I thought that it being September that it's the perfect time to release this. Oh yeah, I also did the music! Thanks for looking!",
