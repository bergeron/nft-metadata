    "description": "The \"Solarized\" collection perfectly encapsulates the style of Modern Vintage Photography. A vintage process, used extensively by some great historic photographers such as Man Ray, is brought into the 21st century by MVP.\n\nSolarization renders part of a photographic image negative and part positive by exposing a print or negative to a flash of light during development.\n\nThis process of digital solarization was created by Modern Vintage Photography to perfectly mimic the effects that can be created in the darkroom. \n\nDate Taken - 12th March 2022\nNFT Edition - 1/1\n\nLicense - Both print and NFT can be displayed privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants. The license includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder. Provides no rights to create commercial merchandise, commercial distribution, or derivative works. Copyright remains with artist.\n",
