    "description": "I'd visualised this shot after visiting this location in Mangawhai (two hours north of Auckland) a few years ago, but had to wait for the full moon to rise at the same time as the sunset to ensure the pink tones and making sure there was a good chance of clear skies.\n\nI would say it was worth the wait.\n\n\n12 inch x 12 inch print on Hahnemuhle Rag Fine Print included\n\n\n\n",
