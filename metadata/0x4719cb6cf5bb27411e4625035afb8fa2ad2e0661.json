    "description": "During the first lockdowns in Scotland back in 2020, I took my telescope out into the front garden  to capture the moon during the day time.  There's just something sci-fi about seeing it during the day.  It gave me something to focus on, something to look forward to and it kept the mind busy. \n\nThis was captured using my Fuji XT-2 attached to a Sky-watcher 72 ed telescope at 400mm. \n\nThe stacking was done in Adobe Photoshop.",
