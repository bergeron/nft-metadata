    "description": "I have always dreamed of going to a distant city, where I could retire from the worries, problems and noise of the big city. And so, one day, I decided to fulfill my dream.\nI rented a small room in a motel in a quiet area of a distant city, where birds can be heard singing in the morning, and in the evening you can enjoy beautiful sunsets. I felt completely alone, no one prevented me from thinking, reasoning and dreaming.\nI spent my days in peace and serenity. I read books, drew and enjoyed every moment. \nI forgot about all my problems, worries and stresses.  I enjoyed every day and didn't want it to end.\nBut unfortunately, sooner or later, I will have to return to the big city and continue my normal life. However, now I know that there is always an opportunity to retire from worries and problems in order to enjoy life and be happy.",
