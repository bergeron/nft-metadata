    "description": "This is an art piece from The Original Block Collection by Blockchain Art Institute, celebrating the creation of SALT, which occurred in block number 4086320 on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\n Originally, this piece came with a rarity index of 9. It means that, upon the debut of the Original Block Collection, it existed in 9 copies. However, starting April 18 2021 it has an updated rarity index of 4. That is due to the fact that the Institute has burned all of its work with rarity indexes of 11, 10, 9, 8 and 7. That means that there will ever be only 4 copies of this art piece. \n\n Congratulations to the owner.",
