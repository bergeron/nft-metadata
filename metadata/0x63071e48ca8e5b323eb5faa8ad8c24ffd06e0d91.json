    "description": "Introducing Sassy Pants by MEGAPIXELS. This little guy is a new kind of mosaic composed of adorable AI-generated tiles, cheekily nicknamed “Bushi”. Here, Wubbushi brings a touch of nostalgia to the constantly evolving intersection of art and technology: the sharp, tiles both evoke traditional pixels while showcasing miniature, fully-formed works of art.\n\nThis piece features thousands of Bushis in the gorgeous diamond pattern.",
