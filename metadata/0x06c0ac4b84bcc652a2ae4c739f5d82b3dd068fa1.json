    "description": "Loki, child of the Giant Fárbauti and Layfey of the Æsir, and Odin's brother. He was both an assister and a hindrance to the gods. \n\nLoki had three children with the giant Angerboda, all terrible in their might. Hel, Fenrir, and Jörmungand, the world serpent. Odin had each of the children brought to him. He gave Hel custody over Niflheim, bound Fenrir, and threw Jörmungandr into the ocean. Jörmungandr grew to such a size that it encircled the world, thus, receiving the name, the World Serpent. ",
