    "description": "5 months on the island of the Gods turned everything. there were so many events, new meetings, absolutely incredible and dope people, but of course there were betrayals and disappointments in myself and others too. great experience which i will remembered for the all my life\n\n5 months of an absolutely amazing life, thanks to which I became more mature, wiser, happier, and most importantly - mentally calmer\n\niâ€™m so grateful to Bali for the return of love and trust in myself, in the world and in people around. and of course for all relationships, because relationships are so sacred. they provide the greatest opportunity in life: to create and embody the experience of the highest manifestation of yourself ",
