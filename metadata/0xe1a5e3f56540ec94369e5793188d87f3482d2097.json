    "description": "Humans are the children of nature. Same as trees. \nTrees take nutrients from the ground through their long and powerful roots. \nJust like trees, we get our energy and nutrients from the ground, but we use trees and plants as a mediator. \nTrees also make the vital oxygen we breathe.\nIf not for the natural world, there will be no us. Isnâ€™t it a good enough reason to take care of our beautiful planet?\n\nThe collector, if they wish, receives a physical copy with the certificate of authenticity.\nIf desired, I can mint the b&w version of this photo.",
