    "description": "An idea of ​​God can be imposed on others, but the God that each person imagines in his mind will be different from the others and will have imaginable characteristics in the mind of the recipient.\n\nWhen you impose an image of God on me, it is a perception of your imagination that forms in my mind.\n\nThis gives me the power to create a god who does whatever comes to my contaminated mind.\n\nWhy is this lie so convincing?\n\nFor me, a lie as big as a god created in my mind is enough for me to be the answer to my disabilities.\n\nBecause I couldn't thank myself for fulfilling my wishes, I created God.\n\nAnd this is a human being who lies as much as a god in the mind of the breeder during his performance.\n\nIt is incapable human who creates the afterlife in their mind and will definitely live in it and will never see their God.",
