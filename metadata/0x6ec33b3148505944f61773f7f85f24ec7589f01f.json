    "description": "\"The Last Soldier\" is a video work by Kenny Schachter, created in 2021.\n\nThe night goggle photo of the last US combatant departing Afghanistan speaks volumes on issues ranging from the alienation and dread of a soldier at war to the hegemony of superpowersâ€”a fading concept that seems less relevant than ever. The premise of the US entering the region, whether under the ruse of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or to combat and defeat the Taliban is at best futile and at worst murderous. The arrogance that the US paternalistically knows what is better for others or is even capable of exerting their will abroad is ridiculous. Sort of like the status quo in the art world (ha)! Look at the outcome of the Afghan conflict; after the loss of countless lives, we are absurdly in the exact same position from where we started. Enough. There are certain photos whether by nature of subject matter or formal composition (or both) that disproportionately grip our attentions and take on greater cultural significance as a result. This news photo, monochromatic due to a night vision camera and populated by a lone, forlorn figure, is just such a work. \n\n"
