    "description": "The [0] Cloud House #01 is a space where you can experience harmony with art and nature. It is a floating space by [0], designed by Krista Kim. It features a unique interoperable system which allows you to connect in the Metaverse in privacy amidst the clouds. The [0] Cloud House is a place where you can disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and connect with your imagination.\n\nThe inspiration for the design connects to the symbolism of the circle, which has been used in art and religion for centuries. In Zen, the circle represents the Void, which is seen as the source of all things. The Cloud House takes these ideas and applies them to the design of a space where people can come to connect with themselves and others in a more meaningful way.\n\nThe Cloud House lives on 0.xyz Metaverse and is interoperable. The multi-platform 3D files are airdropped to the owner.",
