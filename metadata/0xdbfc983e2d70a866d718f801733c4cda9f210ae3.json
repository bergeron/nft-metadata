    "description": "Even though it is emptied again and again it doesn’t stop\nAlthough it is burned it doesn’t burn\nThe grudge of waterfall makes others invisible. \n\nI wanted to capture innocent feelings. As a painter who paints portraits of nature, I tried to bring life into the canvas. If I draw nature, what should I draw? Why should I draw? What should I seek for? Meanwhile, I got immensely shocked, and truthfulness came to my mind. The name has been neglected because it is so natural. The name has been overlooked because it is worn out. I constantly promised to shine for me, myself. I have become a part of nature to draw the nature which stands still but moves eternally. Autumn has already come after vivid green passed. As ever, the golden season lets me look back on the past. I had bright eyes in my old days I faced with reverence, excitement, and childlike innocence. I worked hard to draw a picture without shame in the time like a mirror. Mountains have sounds and scents. Paintings also have sounds and scents.",
