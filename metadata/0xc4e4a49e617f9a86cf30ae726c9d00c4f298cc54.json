Then you notice, drawn somehow by their eyes.\n\nThis piece is inspired by my fascination with the octopus as an ancient, almost alien-like creature, as well as the special relationship it has to the perception of the mind. Equipped with a consciousness beyond our understanding, it remains a lone survivor from another world with a different story to tell. When we dive into the sea, we dive into the origins of us all.\n\nMedium: AI, edited in Photoshop, animated in After Effects",
