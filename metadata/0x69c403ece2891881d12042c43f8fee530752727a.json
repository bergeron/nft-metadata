    "description": "Cached Dreams delights with delicate flows and wanderings through subconscious fluidities, unearthing an unknown language of hidden narratives, imaginaries and cosmologies.\n\nDespite AI marketingâ€™s allusions to Surrealism, it gravely ignores the work and sensibility of the numerous female artists of this movement, repeating thus once again their overshadowing and exclusion from the male-dominated art historical canon.\n\nEmbedded in the alchemical writings of the surrealist Ithell Colquhoun, the AI generated video work unearths an unknown language through the semantic invocations of current text-to-image models while aiming to make visible and celebrate the legacy and tender visions of these artists we feel so relevant to our current times.",
