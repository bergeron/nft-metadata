    "description": "8 years ago I already heard how the shelling sounds and I hoped never to hear these terrible sounds again, but since 02/24/2022 I hear them every day and in particular while writing this text💔\n\nWar turns the whole world, consciousness and values ​​upside down❤️‍🔥\n\nWhat used to seem important is now a mere trifle.\nI want those who look at this picture to appreciate what they have, because you never know at what point everything can change 🙏\n\nI had different dreams but now I only dream of peace❤️🤞",
