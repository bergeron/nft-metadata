    "description": "The idea that is “Programmed Meta” relates to the concept of cultural determinism and how a person's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are determined by the culture in which they are exposed to.\n\nIn this context, Art that contains certain “Metas” like the verified check or PePe have outcomes that are \"programmed\" or \"predestined\" to have a “FOMO” or “Hyped” environment around it because they are deeply rooted in the Digital age culture (social media & web3). We can’t help to flock to these pieces of Art because the “Metas” have been associated with things that played a big part in most of our lives growing up. Its reference to culture reflects the complex relationship between individual agency and cultural context, and the ongoing debates around the nature of culture and its influence on Art and human behavior.\n\nThe challenge for me, was to get my point across without it being another \"checks\" or \"pepe\" piece. \n\nThe challenge for you is to see what the \"metas'' represent.",
