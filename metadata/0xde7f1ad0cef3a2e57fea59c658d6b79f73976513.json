    "description": "It was one of the first snowfalls before Louise froze for the winter. My timing was serendipitous. I arrived first thing in the morning, approximately 6:30 am. The lake was like glass, the snow untouched. It was incredibly peaceful, in every sense of the word; physically, mentally, spiritually. It was one of those mornings where everything lined up perfectly.\n\nIâ€™ll never forget that morning with Louise.",
