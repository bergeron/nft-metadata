    "description": "I left the doll where it was dropped.\nThe truncheon boots and flesh-toned fear \nDrowned out our heathen heartbeats\nIn the orchard of the grey.\n\nThe papers fuel our daydreams \nWith their perestroika screams.\nI left the doll where it was dropped,\nUnmoved with skyward eyes.\n\nThe streets were limp with silence \nAs the wicked grins arrived, \nShrouded by complicit skies.\n\nI left the doll where it was dropped\nWith eyes resigned to absence,\nAdrift in far-flung moments\nWhile red river flashbacks fade.\n\nBleak daylight picks its victims.\nAn execution stayed.\nI left the doll where it was dropped,\nSuspended where the memories stop.\n\nIn dreams, the winds are chiffon \nCalmly covering the slain,\nPropelled from contrite valleys \nWreathed in hyacinths and rain.",
