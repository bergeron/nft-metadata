    "description": "Soul Food Aint Fast Food.\n\nSoulFood (a recorded I originally co-produced with my brothers Ashton Woods & HeizenBURR!) is a song that changed my life. My good friend Rascal took it upon himself to surprise me with a remix to this staple in catalog and the flip has been stuck in the vault for some time now. As we embark on Art Basel to expand this world we're building here in web 3, it only felt right to give you all something to move your bodies and feed your soul.\n\nPlease Enjoy.\n\nJoin the #VibeHaus Collectors Chat: \nhttps://guild.xyz/vibehaus-tribe\n\nWritten & Performed by Scolla Fungwe\nAdditional vocals by Chechi Sarai\nProduced by Tobias \"Rascal\" Breuer\nEngineered & Mixed by Ashton Woods\nArtwork by Scolla Fungwe",
