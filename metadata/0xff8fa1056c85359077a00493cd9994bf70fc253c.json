    "description": "Somewhere in Neverland, near the high seas, there was an old and warm cottage. The fisherman and his family lived there for many years and made a living by fishing. They woke up to the sound of waves and slept dreaming about legendary stories of the sea. The fisherman had a daughter who was well-known for her beauty and grace all over the seas and even in the depth of the oceans.\nOnce on a moonlit night, inhabitants heard strange sounds coming from outside. They suddenly saw a huge terrifying monster with giant tentacles surrounding the whole cottage. It was Kraken, an enormous legendary sea monster. This monster terrified everyone in the cottageâ€¦, but it was only the fisherman's daughter who noticed his true motivation and his beautiful soul. Maybe her dream of meeting a legendary sea creature has come true.\n\nEdition 1/1\n3720 * 4960 px",
