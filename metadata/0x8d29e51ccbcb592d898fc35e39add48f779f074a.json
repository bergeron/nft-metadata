    "description": "One of my personal photographs showcasing a beautiful dramatic vista and skyline at the ruins of Pompei, Italy.\n\nThe scene is located at the exit of the ruins and features a bronze statue overlooking the rolling hills in the distance. This scene gave me the feeling that the statue is bowing it's head and mourning the fall of a once great city during a time of prosperity and power.\n\nTo create this piece, I edited the original photograph, enhanced it with filters, and animated certain parts to create a seamless stunning visual looping NFT.\n\nArt specifications:\nMp4 file\n2.1K pixel dimensions\n4k export\n12-second seamless loop\n\nEnjoy - Pd :-)",
