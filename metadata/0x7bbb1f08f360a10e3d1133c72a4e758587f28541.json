    "description": "\"FI#01\" --  Apr. 29, 2022. \nVideo: 13sec. 720px w. 1080px h.\n\nA conceptual Floating Wildlife Sanctuary designed by architect Mariana Cabugueira\n\nThis project proposes a Floating Botanical Island and a wildlife Habitat located in the open sea of the Western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Floating Botanical Island was created in light of the current problem on Habitat loss and green areaâ€™s destruction around the Western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis Island is designed by a fluid succession of open and semi open green Pavilions. These spaces are planned with different sizes and different climate controls. Not only for plants, the pavilions are destined to provide shelter, long stay-nests and Key Stops for Migratory Birds on their open sea route.\n\nFloating Park Island is a place to respect and live nature.\n\nIt is a fictional project",
