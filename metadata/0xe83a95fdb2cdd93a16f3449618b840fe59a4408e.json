    "description": "Hourglasses appeared when people learned how to blow transparent glass, and the heyday of their use occurred in the Middle Ages. Since then, a lot of water has flowed away, and mechanical, electronic, talking and other watches were born. The hourglass is almost out of use, but it is they who are the symbol of the storage of time, its inexorable flow and the fragility of the present moment.",
