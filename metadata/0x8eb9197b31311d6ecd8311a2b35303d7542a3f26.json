    "description": "I've gotta say lads, it was going pretty well...\n\nSurely nobody was in.\n\nI was definitely giving this a shot!\n\nI walked around the house, a window wasn't shut. I went in & straight to the basement.\n\nWhere else would OSF keep his Hopium stash?\n\nWow. There must have been 10K bottles. Sheesh.\n\nMaybe 1,2K bottles will fit in the back of my truck? I'll take what I can now, and come back for more.\n\nI fetched my truck, backed it up, and got straight to business.\n\nI was nearly done, but damn...\n\nIt was OSF & Mando! They must have been on of their friendly walks, and forgotten the WAGMI juice.\n\nOSF roared. Out of nowhere Degenz land on the roof. Arghh they're coming for me lads!\n\nI jumped in the truck, keys in the ignition, I'm getting out of here.\n\nTires screeched, engine roared, next thing I know, OSF beams lasers at me.\n\nI was swerving left and right, bottles crashed it was nuts, I tell you lads!  \n\nI nearly didn't make it. \n\nBut here I am with 1,000 bottles of Hopium. Let's throw a party.\n",
