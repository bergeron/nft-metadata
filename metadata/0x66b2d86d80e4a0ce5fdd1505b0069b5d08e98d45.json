    "description": "There’s music in the night sky for those who bother to pause and listen. It more or less goes this way, “There’s a starman waiting in the sky, he’d like to come and meet us but he thinks he’d blow our minds.” And yes, I feel at times, starman is indeed David Bowie or maybe it's you and me — given we all float in space and we are nothing but a blip of light to someone else looking from far corners of our cosmic ocean :)\n“The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. On this shore, we've learned most of what we know. Recently, we've waded a little way out, maybe ankle-deep, and the water seems inviting. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return, and we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.” - Carl Sagan",
