    "description": "the stick-circle nft is a chance for us to see the process of making something From Nature, that is less made than found or collected, put together during a short walk.\n\nToday, we decided to go on what was almost a hunt for nature. What was what we might call a collecting of nature. We wanted to find some things, then organize them by category, and then form them together into a single image.\n\nthis project of “organizing nature” is an ongoing project that we will continue to make and participate in. This is the first installment of the project.\n\nWe walked around the park with an empty amazon bag and placed bits of nature inside of it. It felt like a sort of revamped easter egg hunt given the day I chose to embark. I thought it was funny that I was using an Amazon bag, as I see Amazon and nature as funny in coming together.\n\nThe project began as a dream. I had a dream about making something out of natural elements. It also came from a children’s book I read; art for children.",
