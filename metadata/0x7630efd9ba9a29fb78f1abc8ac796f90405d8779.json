    "description": "There are approximately 1.71 billion people in the world that have some form of a musculoskeletal condition. \n\nFor the past 4 years I have been working to develop a working model of artificial human muscle, in order to identify a cure for the most severe form of muscular dystrophy. \n\nThis collection is in honour of the brave patients who carried the muscle disorder, and donated their stem cells for research. \n\nMy collection comprises of 8 images taken with a transmission electron microscope (a stinkinâ€™ expensive microscope that captures super super close up images (think electrons)) of the worlds FIRST (major emphasis on the word first, *self applause*) ever functional human muscle tissues that was made in a Petri dish, in a lab, using human stem cells. Did I forget to mention the muscles contract in the dish?! \n\nWith every passing day, we become closer to developing a novel technology that will positively impact the search to improve the lives of those affected. Be part of history!\n\n",
