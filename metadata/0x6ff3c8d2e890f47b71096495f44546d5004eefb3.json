    "name": "Mick Jagger | Goodnight London #1/9",
    "created_by": "Tony Gale",
    "description": "It’s the 14th March 1971. Tickets have long sold out for London's Roundhouse venue, situated in the uber-trendy Camden Town district. Tonight the iconic 18th century built venue will play host to London's favourite sons, The Rolling Stones. The final night of the bands “Goodbye Britain” tour had arrived and the band owed the British government hundreds of thousands of pounds in backdated taxes that they were unable to pay. As a result they were to become tax exiles in the French Rivera.\n\nThis print entitled “Goodnight London” captures a stunning view of Mick Jagger live onstage performing to a 5000 strong partisan crowd in what would be the Stones last major appearance in the U.K. until the “Goats Head Soup” tour of 1973. The photo was taken by celebrated British rock photographer Tony Gale.\n\nEach NFT is accompanied with a photographic art piece, hand numbered with a limited quantity & is HSA authenticated with COA at https://hsauthentication.com",
