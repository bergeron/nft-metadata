    "description": "This is a reimagining of the fabled sword of myth, leaning more into a fantasy style. The ogham runes on the blade imbue it with ancient magic. I wanted the weapon to have more of a natural elemental feel to it to go with the theme of coming from the lady in the lake. The jewel on the pommel is held with roots coming from the handle made of a living wood which acts as a conduit for the energy to pass through the sword.",
