    "description": "Snap It, is the title track of the collection. My improvisation techniques are part endurance art and part Diasporic tradition. As an Artist and Composer, my research influences are broad and inclusive of Classical and World Music as well as popular tunes. The complicated part of my practice is making people believe I am still making pictures. But now I am the composer and the composition.",
