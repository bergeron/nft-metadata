    "description": "Every morning the dawn brings a brand new day. A fresh start. A blank canvas. If you will it so, it can be your masterpiece. \n\nThe dawn is a chance for a new beginning.  A special gift. It is a good time to reflect on the past.  To cherish special memories. Learn from our mistakes. And make plans for how we can make this new day even better.  \n\nThis image was captured in the early minutes of a new morning. Literally in our own backyard and will forever be a special image. It is one of the early images in Houston's photographic journey. It helped prove that he not only had an eye for finding beauty in simple things, but also that he was willing to do what it takes to share his vision of the world with others.\n\nWe will be forever grateful for your encouragement and support. And, we are so glad to have you joining along in this journey. So, with the each sunrise comes an opportunity for reflection: \n\nWhat difference can you make in your corner of the world? \n\nHow will you spend this gift of a new day?",
