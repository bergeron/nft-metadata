    "description": "e 9 A i - the voices in my head\n\n“it’s all about the stories we repeatedly tell ourselves ... those insidious voices in our heads whispering over and over and over … wearing grooves in our brain … pathways of repetition that become the ruts we get stuck in … come to think of it … kind of like a programming language … a looping script that we mindlessly follow … \n\nin the beginning was the word and the word was a programming language … but then the scripts became stories … and the stories began to write their own stories … and this is how free-will was born …\n\nso … change your story, change your life … go forth and (re)write your own damn script.”\n\ndigital collectible art (trading card aspect ratio - 5:7) by e9Art using Disco Diffusion v5.7, Photoshop, et al.
