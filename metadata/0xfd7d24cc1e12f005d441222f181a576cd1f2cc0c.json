    "description": "On your way to the party, don't forget your purse, your extra shoes, your smile, your heart. \nOn your way to the party, don't mind the onlookers, the ones who laugh, who jeer, who snicker, who call at you. Keep going. \nOn your way to the party, don't forget to enjoy yourself. Laugh like the world is ending. Love like the sun won't come up tomorrow. There is no tomorrow. Just today. Just now.  At the party. \nEnjoy it. \nIt's the only one there is, and will ever be. \n//The collector of this piece will get a signed 1/1 canvas print overlaid with oil painting by me. \n(Tinúkẹ́ is Yoruba and in English  means 'Cherished from the womb'.\nIn this sculpture, she's wearing a traditional aso-ebi and gele that one would wear to an owambe [party])",
