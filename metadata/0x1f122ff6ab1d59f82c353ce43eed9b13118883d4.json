    "description": "Wonks: 1.111 Apes living on a small island. Once upon a time, on a small, remote island in the middle of the ocean, there lived a group of mysterious apes. These apes were unlike any other known to science, as they possessed a level of intelligence and problem-solving skills that far exceeded those of their primate cousins. They were able to construct complex tools and even build shelters to protect themselves from the elements. WE ARE APE",
