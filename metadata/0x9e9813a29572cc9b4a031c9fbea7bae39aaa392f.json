    "description": "The artwork uses black stones as objet for artistâ€™s daily contemplation. Inspired by formative nature of stones, the artist reconstructs his thoughts, emotions, and memories in black fragments. Across multiple canvases, these black fragments all add up to become what the artist defines as \"black, something\". \n\n#NFTart  #black  #physical-based",
