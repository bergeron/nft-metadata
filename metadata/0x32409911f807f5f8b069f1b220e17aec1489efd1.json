    "description": "visual art project inspired by the new pop culture dedicated to the American icons: vehicles, urban places, food, object, and other stuff. More than 15 years of street photography on the American roads to looking for what is the true America in the most common situations. But doesn't matter look dirty, ugly, or broken because they are iconic and authentic. Beautiful like a design and luxury car because they are our American dream. The idea is to create a complex art project that become viral, included giant fine art prints in super limited edition, stickers, a beer collection, a print t-shirts collection, street art installations by paste-up, and of course an NFT's collection. To do this the idea is showing the subject without the environment in a white limbo created to show all thems like supermarket products ready to buy like in a modern e-commerce\n\nUnique Amerika #Impala Glam 003\nunique NFT\n9.368 × 6.812 px",
