    "description": "Finding human life in the harsh and inhospitable environment that is the Sahara Desert is surreal. \nDaunting rides through the remotest places on Earth have taught me that those who still inhabit these lands are tougher than diamonds, smart, and extremely hospitable.  \nMauritania, just as many other West-African countries, has a very ethnically diverse population, with 7 major tribes that can be found all over the territory, with some areas of high concentration for most of them.  \nWhile exploring all latitudes of this almost forgotten country, I got to know a lot about its peculiar culture, something that I wasn’t accustomed to but that quickly conquered me and gave me a new mindset for the whole duration of the trip, one of curiosity and gratitude.\n\n“People of the Sahara” depicts my experience with the inhabitants of Mauritania over the span of a two-month trip, where I learned their unique greeting system, a whole new language, their hospitality customs, their faith in Islam, and much more",
