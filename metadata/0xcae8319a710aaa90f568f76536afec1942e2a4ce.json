    "description": "Wayte Wrangle's Double Eye Guns won many a showdown 'till he hung up his guns && then they built a museum 'round 'm! The Most Amazing Marksman the West Has Ever Known, thats what they called 'm, or so he said. Wrangle could spin a yarn a mile long inna minute flat. Bewitchingly handsome by all accounts, Wrangle was memorable as all git out. Err one who met 'm along the trail said so. He was said to have ridden wit the best of the best, from Nat Love in Red River to J.P. Bushrod himself, out California way!",
