    "description": "Ola, was created in October 2021. I took this shot on a windy early morning on Puerto\nRicoâ€™s north shore in the town of Arecibo. An offshore hurricane left some swells for\nsurfers to play in and for photographers to capture.\nThis top down view offers a unique & uncommon viewpoint only possible with aerial\nphotography. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do."
