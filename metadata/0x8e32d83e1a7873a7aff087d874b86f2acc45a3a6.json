    "description": "Monument #1 on the Horizon.\n\nThe sun was setting and I was alone. I've never been here before, yet the aura of this place felt so familiar. The only thing breaking up this void for miles was a lonely monument, standing there, lost to time. Its dynamic shape made it look like it was moving, swaying in the wind, like a silky curtain â€“ but there was no wind. Just a monument stuck in the silent sunset.\n\nAn original 2000x2000px piece by Slovak-Hungarian digital artist, ParanoidAnyway created in 2022.",
