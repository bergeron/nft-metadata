    "description": "Being unapologetically expressive within my femininity & sensuality is a state that was alien to me. I always felt like a shell of myself, shrinking to appease the appetites & judgments of others. Finding my voice through music has encouraged me to release censorship of self.\n\nSwift is one of the first songs I wrote after years of suppressing expression. It was also the first music video that I directed, choreographed, & produced with my company, Forbidden Fruit, on July 31, 2021.\n\nSwift is an embodiment of sexualityâ€™s pure nature, linking us from our inner children to our primal instincts & base desires. Swift is a reclamation of Play. Passion. & Pleasure... & it is my hope that this piece inspires others to find liberation deep within.\n\nDirector: Crux \nCreative Director: Affia \nProducer: Nabid \nEngineer: Fuzzmack \nVideographer: $tonez the Organic \nEditors: Fazevzn + Crux \nVFX: Sam Sherfey + Crux \nChoreographer: Crux \nDancers: Aaminah, Sylvie, Ericka \nDirector of Photography: JoLeaha Larke \nStylist: Crux \nProduction: Forbidden Fruit",
