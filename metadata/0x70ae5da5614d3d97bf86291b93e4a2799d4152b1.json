    "description": "Influenced by the Hitchcock film. A professional photographer is stuck in his apartment, recuperating from a broken leg. Out of boredom, he begins to spy on his neighbours and comes across a shocking revelation.\n\nThis piece combines the brutalist architecture of the Boyd Orr building of Glasgow University with a night time setting to give a cinematic feel to this pseudo abstract architecture shot. Paddy McDougall is conveying a sense of drama and isolation. Jan 2022",
