    "description": "We let go to hold on; the paradox of submitting to change elevates understanding.\n\nAt some point, we learn to give in, and submit to the wave of chaos life presents us with. This can be a state of release, but more importantly it is a space in which to learn from our past selves. The irony of letting go of something to better understand how to hold on to that which matters most is most apparent in this state. The path to self-mastery is defined by acceptance of that which we cannot bend to our will. \n\nThis position speaks of complete release, but it is difficult to tell if one is falling into the void, or being thrown up to a higher level of understanding. Elevation can be the world coming down to one's level, or one's rise to understanding of it.\n\nCreator: Orb√°n Isma\nExplorer is Justin Whitkin\nPhoto: 3840px x 5760px 240DPI",
