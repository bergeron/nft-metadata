    "description": "Chapter One- Seven empty homes.\n\nPeter Spruce is tiered. The rite of passage linking him to the giant Sprun creature has been a taxing experience. He can hear the creature's thoughts in his mind, and feels a gentle push from the untapped power granted by the Sprun-link. The Spruce family has linked to these creatures for generations, granting them different magical abilities. The letter came a week after the bonding. \"Peter Spruce, the seven families are summoned to the Woodlands. Come, Spruce.\" Peter recites, exhausted before they even get on their way. He can hear a low chuckle next to his own inner voice. \"I'm not carrying you, kid. Try to keep up.\"  The Sprun leaps forward, departing for the Woodlands.",
