    "description": "Made from motion. The lines are paths which represent the motion of thousands of tiny pixel-sized particles of light. The particles are subject to simulated forces, like gravity and electromagnetism.\n\nThese particular forces are repulsion, meaning they push everything away. This results in small areas of negative space that resemble the \"drip\" shapes found in paisley.",
