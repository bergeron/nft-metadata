    "description": "The appeal of oddly satisfying Animations is thought to lie in the human preference for symmetry, patterns and repetition, the interest of exploring the behavior of materials, or hand movements. It may be related to the autonomous sensory meridian response, a pleasant tingling sensation in the neck and scalp.The effect of watching such Animations has been described as a \"brain massage\" or \"lightly hypnotizing\", and as a form of psychological self-care to help overcome stress or anxiety. The satisfaction derived from oddly satisfying animations may have to do with mirror neurons, which fire both when one performs a motion and when one watches someone else perform a motion. Enjoy this Relaxation Animation.",
