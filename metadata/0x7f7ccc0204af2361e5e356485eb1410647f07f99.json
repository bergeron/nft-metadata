    "description": "CATHARSIS HAS PARTNERED WITH THE FLS TEAM TO CREATE CUSTOM NFT+PHYSICAL WEARABLES!\n\nEach NFT is one of four hand-rendered MP4 video loops, featuring the pendants in the artwork, as well as a custom sound track made by Fame Lady's very own @IAMNAX! Every NFT minted is redeemable for 1 physical PRECIOUS METAL pendant. All 888 pieces are marked with an OG stamp, and will never be reproduced the same as this limited edition drop!\n\n10% OF MINT GOES TO THE FLS TEAM DIRECTLY, TO FUND COMMUNITY GROWTH!\n\nThe redemption page will be open INDEFINITELY. Redemption opens on the mint page as soon as mint closes, and will remain open until all the tokens have been redeemed and all the physicals shipped! Youâ€™ll be directed to a form to fill out your shipping information, and of course, shipping is included in the mint price!\n\nAs more and more people redeem for their physicals, the supply of unredeemed pendants and physicals will decrease; becoming even more valuable over time! This offers you, the collector, a chance for a return on investment by HODLing.\n\nSquad Up! Now you can represent the Fame Ladies, both digitally and IRL.",
