    "description": "I dreamt I lived in a cabin by the sea.  \nIts walls were small, but I survived  \nby making the beach my home.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Artist:**  Steve Walasavage  \n**Series:**  Non-Fungible Travels  \n**Collection:**  Dreaming California  \n**Edition:**  1/1 NFT  \n  \n---  \n  \nAbout *Dreaming California*:  Many years ago, shortly after I finished college, I packed up everything I owned and drove across the country from Boston to San Diego.  I had no job lined up, few friends there, and fewer plans.  Somehow though, I made my way, and had countless amazing experiences in the process!  I lived there by the beach for exactly one year, and it was one of the most formative and monumental years of my life.  However, I had no fancy camera back then, so my memories are fading, becoming more abstract and dreamlike with each passing year...  \n  \nIn the time since I lived in southern California, I've returned many times.  I've explored natural and man-made beauty all over this state, and thankfully I've captured bits and pieces of it with each trip.  *Dreaming California* is a set of images I've put together that conveys my own dream-like memories of my first year there, as well as my subsequent visits since.  I hope you enjoy these depictions of the Golden State as much as I enjoyed crafting them!  \n  \nEach NFT in this collection is a 1/1 edition.  \n  \n---  \n  \nExtended Editorial License:  Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
