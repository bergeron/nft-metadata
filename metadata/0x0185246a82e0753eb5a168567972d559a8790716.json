    "description": "Today is Trans Day of Visibility 2023. i am a trans man so therefore i would like to participate. this is CENTIPEDE, a lil interlude that i started in 2022 around the summertime (first vocal track was recorded June 29th, 2022). the song was originally written with the beat and a topline, few lyrics except for \"centipede and the butterflies\" freestyled and the story came later. it was originally about the duality of life and a motivating song to keep pushing forward and the universe is a reflection of your internal world. it still is but as time has progressed it shifted from being a message to my nephews and niece to my internal struggle with fitting into society and being accepted as a trans person. so i felt it was right to be visible, take up space, and be myself.",
