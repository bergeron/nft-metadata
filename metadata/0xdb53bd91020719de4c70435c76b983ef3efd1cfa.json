    "description": "We sat in the same chair dad did  \nAnd tried to keep it warm the same way he did  \nFor the kids we’d never have  \nBecause the winters seemed colder  \nThan they once did  \nAnd the sun seemed to favor other towns  \nInstead of ours  \nAnd dad said the chair was the only thing he’d ever loved  \nWhen he died  \nBut sometimes we found light elsewhere  \nIn screaming flesh  \nOr wood and string \nOr the hook beckoning something to feed  \nOr the destruction of will to leave  \nOr dissolving self into inanimate objects  \nBecause the threads of the chair  \nNeeded our weight  \nAnd our audience craved our failure  \nBecause both provisions were tradition  \nBecause someday we’d tell someone  \nThat we loved the chair too  \nEven though we didn’t",
