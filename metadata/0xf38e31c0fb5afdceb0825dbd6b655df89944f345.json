    "description": "This is the 2nd Music Video NFT from Saint Rien.\n\nLike You was one of the funnest videos to create!   The song and video is an insight into my young, substance-filled journey from being a hopeless romantic who didn’t believe in love. To finding my soulmate years later. \n\nFrom passion to attachment, drama, and betrayal, I wanted to build the song around the line; “I can fall in love with someone… hmmm, like you.’ Alternating between light heartedness or sarcasm and a more profound unveiling of the fact that I used to put myself through hell for someone, anyone to love me.  \n\nThe second half of the song and video depicts the death of my former self and my new life (in heaven) with my now wife, Stephanie. We met a month before I was to move to America and after doing long distance for 6 months, I proposed. Three years later we’re happier than ever. \n\nIf you purchase this NFT you will get: \n\n- The full original script used. In hard copy or digital download.\n- A 1/1 Call with Saint Rien\n- A free mint of a very cool upcoming project coming soon ;)\n\nPeace.\n\nWritten, Directed and Produced by Saint Rien\nDirector of Photography - Daniel Chaney\nEditor - Daniel Chaney\nTalent - Stephanie Flockhart, Brendan Hayes, Mary Kathryn Kopp, Andy Dunkin\nArt - Annie Liliholm\n",
