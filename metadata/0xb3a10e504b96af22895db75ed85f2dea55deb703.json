    "description": "Whenever I miss you, I dive into the world we created.\nI can feel the energy of the beauty that lies within.\nI feel comforted by the powers holding our world together,\nBy the solid foundation based on our trust and our love.\nI let its warmth run through me. I feel whole again.\nDreamland.\n\nThe basis is a physical painting using acrylic ink on paper with glitter, then turned digital, 7500x5000px, in March 2022, by Monika's Art.\nAfterwards, Katalina Oooma added her digital illustration using Clip Studio Paint Pro and Adobe Photoshop.",
