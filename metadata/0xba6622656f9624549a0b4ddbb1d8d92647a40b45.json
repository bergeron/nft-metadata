    "description": "Fear City, my dark dystopian universe, was initially 6 characters with 3333 computer generated variations. For the past 18 months I've been writing the Fear City lore, character biographies, video game play and scripts for a series of Fear City comics (first irl comic to be published in early 2023).  \nEach of these hand painted portraits are a glimpse into the lives of some of the city's VIPs, they suggest a narrative that's hopefully intriguing and relatable.",
