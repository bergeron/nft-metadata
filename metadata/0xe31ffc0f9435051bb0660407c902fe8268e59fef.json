    "description": "'Who Am I? 'iD 28' 2022 GINGER ELF X KIKU'S WORLD by SABET' is a Limited Edition piece in collaboration between me and the amazingly talented Sabet.\n\nIt is part of my 'Who Am I?' Collection. A collection celebrating the rights of passage of finding our true identity. \n\nAll pieces are named 'iD..' as until we find ourselves we don't really know who we really are. \n\nTo all those still searching, there is hope, we all do get there in the end, so never give up, it does get easier. And like the peacock finally unfurling its wings, be proud of who you have become - be exceptional and amazing!\n\nA final important note, these pieces are a celebration of the beauty of the indigenous people of this world, they truly are the lifeblood and vibrancy of this world we live in and should be embraced and celebrated as such.",
