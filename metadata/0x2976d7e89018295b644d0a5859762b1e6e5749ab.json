    "description": "Stare at this long enough, then look away and things will start to move... \n\nNihil has arrived at a place we all come to eventually. He is dead.\n\nPast memories and sense of self fade into nothing as he sinks through the timeless void.\n\nHis body separates and dissolves into new lifeforms that spread out and fill the space, they are as much apart of him as he is of them.\n\nOut of all the new beings who now inhabit his awareness, he focuses most on the one who sits calmly in the center beneath a knowing tree, he names him 'Nihil'.",
