    "description": "\"Love has no other desire but to fulfill itself  \nBut if your love and must needs have desires,  \nLet these be your desires:\n\nTo melt and be like a running brook  \nThat sings its melody to the night.  \nTo know the pain of too much tenderness.  \nTo be wounded by your own understanding of love;  \nAnd to bleed willingly and joyfully.  \nTo wake at dawn with a winged heart  \nAnd give thanks for another day of loving;  \nTo rest at the noon hour and meditate on love's ecstasy;  \nTo return home at eventide with gratitude;  \nAnd then to sleep with a prayer  \nFor the beloved in your heart  \nAnd a song of praise upon your lips\"\n\n- Khalil Gibran\n\n\n\n3884px X 4096px  \nCreated digitally on procreate by putting together parts from 11 artworks sold on Foundation and Opensea until July '22",
