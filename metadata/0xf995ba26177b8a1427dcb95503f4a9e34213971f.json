    "description": "Cradle Mountain, Tasmania. \n\nA magnificent glow of moonlight reflecting off the snow atop of Cradle Mountain. I recall sitting by Dove Lake... in darkness, freezing cold and trying to take in the overwhelming scene in front of me.\n\nThis image was created from an incredible 10 day road trip around Tasmania. One of my favorite holidays to date.",
