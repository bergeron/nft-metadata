    "description": "Eurystratos had fought in countless wars for the glory of Sparta since he was but a green boy of 12. His mother had named him after the first Dual Kings of Sparta, in order to evoke ancient powers within him. But He had grown tired of fighting to please ever-bored Gods, for to see mortals spill each otherï¿½s blood was but entertainment for them. And he grew to resent the powers that caused men to be powerless when their fate and lives were concerned.",
