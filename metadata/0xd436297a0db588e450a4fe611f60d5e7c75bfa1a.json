    "description": "LIA went out looking for shadows, and stumbled upon something else: a new kind of creature, red, white, and black, flickering and dancing across her monitor. Trying to capture its playful movements she found that, even frozen in time, it wouldn’t stay still. Sometimes the things you see don’t seem to be real. Sometimes the things you don’t see become reality.\n\nEach piece in this collection is a hand-selected moment from the wandering life of this creature.
