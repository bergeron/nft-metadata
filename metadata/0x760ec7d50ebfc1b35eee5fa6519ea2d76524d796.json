    "description": "In the Venusian wilds, two sisters roam\nLira and Nyla, identical as bone\nThrough verdant forests, they do tread\nGathering fruits that are rare and red\n\nWith voices sweet, they sing of love\nOf unity, in the stars above\nBut Lira's gift, is one of mind\nShe can read thoughts, of any kind\n\nWhile Nyla holds power, in her hand\nOver elements, in this land\nTogether, they rule, with a steady hand\nTheir kingdom, in a state of grand\n\nThrough the darkness and the light\nTheir bond, a Venusian delight\nForever entwined, in this tale\nLira and Nyla, never to fail.",
