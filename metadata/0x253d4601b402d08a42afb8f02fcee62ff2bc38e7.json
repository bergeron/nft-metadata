    "description": "The portraits are created by AI and inspired by the Japanese painting, ‘Noh Dance Prelude (序の舞, Jo-no-mai)’. It was painted in 1936 by the female painter, Uemura Shōen (1875 - 1949) and she is famous for Bijin-ga (美人画, beautiful person picture). ‘Noh Dance Prelude’ is one of her representative works. \n\nShe was born in Meiji period. She lost her father before her birth and she was raised by her mother. In Meiji period, it was very difficult to aspire to be a painter for women. But her mother, Nakako always understood Shōen and continued to encourage and support her.\n\nI found the similarity between her life and my life even though we live in the different times. I was touched by how she lived strongly as a painter and also woman. The techniques are digital but I always focus on ‘human’. Learning the historical context and the Shōen’s character, I am exploring a humanistic expression.\n\nSound artist: Shuta Yasukochi\nSong title: Cave\nAlbum title: Glow In The Dark (2023)\n\nMade with: Midjourney, TouchDesigner, Adobe\nSize: 1920 x 1920 px\nDuration: 33 sec (seamless loop)\n\nThe owner of primary sale will be able to receive a higher quality encoding file.",
