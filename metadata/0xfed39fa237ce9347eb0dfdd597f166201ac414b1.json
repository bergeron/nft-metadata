    "description": "There is a HIDDEN CODE embedded in each NFT of THE ID_NT COLLECTIVE collection. The code points to a website hosting the complete list of all 10,000 of the world's most commonly used passwords - for all your hacking needs. Holders need to HACK THIS NFT to find the code. Investigate visual cryptography and perform standard steganographic analysis to reveal the code. See website for hints and resources: https://id3nt.carrd.co/ This NFT is an ANONYMITY MASK on a background of PASSWORDS taken from the world's 10,000 most commonly used passwords. The wordlist on this piece is unique from all others in this collection, printed with a randomly generated color, and no two masks share the same complete set of traits. This project is a meditation on the anonymity mask you can choose to wear, and a celebration of the divine freedom to opt to do so.",
