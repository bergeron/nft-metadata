    "description": "The picture is taken from Kaziranga National Park in the Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state of Assam, India. The park, which hosts two-thirds of the world's great one-horned rhinoceroses, is a World Heritage Site.  The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants. The beautiful autumn season gives me this beautiful picture. The whole light and the natural beauty of the forest enhance the frame's elegance. Elephants are fascinating animals and have captured our imagination for time immemorial.\n\nPhoto By Manoop Chandran\n\nEdition - 1 / 1\n\nYear - 2019\n\nCamera & Lens - Canon 1 DX MARK 2 , 800mm",
