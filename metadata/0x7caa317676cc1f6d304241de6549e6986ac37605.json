    "description": "This photograph is from my Future Cities project about informal urban development in the world's cities. These photographs were made between 2010 and 2015.\n\nThis is from a set of important photographs in the evolution of Future Cities, because it represented a widening of the scope of the project. Until this time, I had mostly focused on the homes and residential areas. But when thinking about informal development, the informal economy is also very important. When my fixer brought me to the Mirpur One area, this all became more clear. This photograph is of a busy market area in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was made just after sunset from the balcony of a building similar to the one pictured.\n\nEdition of 12\n\n4671x3598 pixels",
