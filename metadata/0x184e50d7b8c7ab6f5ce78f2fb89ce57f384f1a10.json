    "description": "A land of limitless opportunities and dreams, a place where time is not bound. There are an infinite number of paths to take, but only one is given. The higher you build mountains today, the closer the dreams of tomorrow will be. Each piece is a representation of time in different forms; days of 24 hours split into 60. The name and the outcome of the piece depend on the order in which it is minted. Every single creation is one of a kind, a stopped moment in time.",
