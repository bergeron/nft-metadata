    "description": "The genesis of the \" LA Crazy bathroom \" collection comes from a trip I made to LA several years ago. I went for a walk on the \"Strip\" on Sunset Blvd.\n\nThe history of the club \"Whisky Ã  GOGO\" where the DOORS often performed in the 70's, as well as the club \"The LondonFog\" and many others struck me. \n\nThe places were invaded by all of the Rockstart. This story trotted in my head for a long time and a collection was born.\n\nI created an imaginary bathroom in the backstage of these clubs, with the atmosphere of the seventies.\n",
