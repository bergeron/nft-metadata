    "description": "Hygieia is the protagonist of the first Billethereum representing hope and the cure in a new era in which a neo renaissance in arts is happening, taking its impact to inhospitable fields with inmense potential. Just a Dream Lab defines this with one single word: Future\nIn each Billethereum the presence of a divine or mythological entity will take place. In addition to the artwork, each Billethereum will come with 4 features that guarantee its authenticity and these are the following:\n- Numbering\n- The seals that guarantee its authenticity\n- A short resonating phrase\n- The “???” typical and mysterious golden question \n   marks that hide the value of the Billethereum in \n   Ethereum until they are purchased.\nEach new Billethereum will be auctioned every 15 days after the day of the last Billethereum sold, until Planet Earth stops being Planet Earth.\nFor more info visit our medium article about the Art piece here: https://medium.com/@justadreamlab/billethereum-657724f2ef4f",
