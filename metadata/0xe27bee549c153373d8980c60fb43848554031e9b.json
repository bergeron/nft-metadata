    "description": "The letters in the bottles, and the faith of those who wrote them,  \nWaves come and go, yet the moon and Sun are always the same,  \nCheers for the ones I didn't drink to find and share Light Under Waterâ€¦\n\nInspired by the ancient city of Dwarka, one of the seven holy pilgrimage centres in India, part of this archeological and architectural wonder is said to have sunk beneath the Arabian Sea.\n\nThis piece represents rebirth, evokes times and places where we find hope and renewal within ourselves. Even in the darkest or most challenging of times, there is light around us, helping to uncover the potential that lies within us. \n\n\nMusic Made in 432 Hz  \nProd. By Yoshiro Mare",
