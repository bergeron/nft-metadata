    "description": "one of the most beautiful moments of my life was visiting this valley \" CHANDRATAL \" . At 4200m above sea level and living the dream was magical.\n\nIt was 35min hike with my heavy backpack and gears to reach to this spot. But, the moment i reached to the other side of the valley and saw this majestic mountain in front of me, my heart filled with joy & love. I have been visiting Himalayas since 2007 but this moment was really imprinted on me deeply. \n\nLoved the haziness and dim light shining on the mountains and whole valley was shining with softness of colors and haziness. I wanted to capture it like as dream and living the dream. So, i asked my friend to stand on other side and i wanted to portray the connect of life and Nature. \n\nEXIF- NIKOND850 + lens 24-120 f/13 ISO-100 1/320sec\nLocation : chandratal lake ( Spiti valley) \nArtist : NAKUL SHARMA\nYear: 2021\nEdition : 1/1 ",
