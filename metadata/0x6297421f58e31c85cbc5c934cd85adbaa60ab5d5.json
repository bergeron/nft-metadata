    "description": "The Pushkar festival is a festival of camels and nomads.  Along with the animal trade, it is the amalgamation of different cultures and people that makes this event what it is. Diverse cultures, identities, traditions and people who come together to celebrate the week. \nNot only Rajastani people nor Indians, pushkar festival is a celebration to many nomads from different parts of the world. They visit Thar every year to witness the festival. Being one of the biggest festivals of wandering lives, they meet at the desert to see, understand and learn each other's lives and cultures. There is nothing called within or outside, the oneness of nomads do not set boundaries because they don't have any. \nWhen the world tries to create a life at one place, settle down there, they expand their world by exploring within.\n\nEDITION : 1/1\nLOCATION : RAJASTHAN,INDIA",
