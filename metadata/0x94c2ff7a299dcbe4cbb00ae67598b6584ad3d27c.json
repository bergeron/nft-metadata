    "description": "In 1817 Sir David Brewster described (in British patent no. 4136), a most marvelous instrument, the Kaleidoscope.\n\nIn these generative art works a space is repeatedly rotated, shifted, enlarged and folded.\n\nThe folds are like a reflection in a mirror, or an origami fold.\n\nPoints in the original space are colored according to their trajectory under these transformations.\n\nThe coloring scheme was inspired by a Scientific American article about how butterfly wings are colored according to location relative to focal points.\n\nThis image is 10000 by 10000 pixels in JPEG format.",
