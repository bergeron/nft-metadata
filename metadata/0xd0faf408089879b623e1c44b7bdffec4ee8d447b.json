    "description": "A study of play.  \n2022.\n\nLife can be broken down into a series of lessons.  \nThese aren't necessarily good or bad, but they are inevitable.  \nWe always have a choice though.  \nIgnore the lessons and go around in circles  \nor  \nDeep dive and embrace them, master them.  \nThe latter usually results in a shift;  \nLessons turn into play  \nand  \nLife turns into your playground.\n\n\nSeen here, is a girl submerged in a state of play, completely surrendering herself.  \nThe metallic sheen on her skin symbolises her resilience while her bunny ears show her sense of playfulness.  \nShe is surrounded by hard covers representing lessons learnt. \nSome were difficult, some are mastered and some even cherished.  \nThe flora and the flamingos bring about a sense of lushness, a life lived and truly experienced.  \nFinally, the Easter eggs and my beloved moonmen, ever present, ever watchful.",
