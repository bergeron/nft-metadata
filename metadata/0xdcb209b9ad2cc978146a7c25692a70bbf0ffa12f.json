    "description": "The FUCK YOU collection is a response to the May 2, 2022 Supreme Court draft leak, revealing the intended overturn of Roe v Wade. In the days and weeks following, Molly Dickson (of Computer Cowgirls) created resistance art - with hopes of raising money for organizations that provide abortion access across the country.  The FUCK YOU collection's smart contract and art was donated to Endaoment, a 501c3 organization, allowing them to sell 10,000 FUCK YOU NFTs. All proceeds from these FUCK YOU NFTs are received by Endaoment, and granted to charities with the advisement of COWGIRLDAO. COWGIRLDAO seeks to fund organizations that provide abortion access and send a giant FUCK YOU to anyone standing in the way of reproductive freedom.",
