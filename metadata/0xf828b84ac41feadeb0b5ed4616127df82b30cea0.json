    "description": "one of my favorite things about AI art is that it’s unexpected. \n\nthus fulfilling my major life-goals and my purpose in art: childlike WONDER joyful SURPRISE, playful ADVENTURE and meaningful PURPOSE.\n\nand yes, it IS meaningful, if for no other reason than it satisfies my life-goals. but also, i’m learning new things, it’s helping me grow, it’s part of my education and practice. \n\nin other words, it’s making me a better artist. \n\nAI is a tool in my artist’s toolbox, like a camera, or perhaps like photoshop. and it comes with a variety of methods of fine-tuning, allowing me to manipulate the end results.\n\nbut also … because of its random and unpredictable nature ... it somehow adds to, and becomes part of, my INTUITIVE process. \n\nnot to mention it’s fun as hell, a wild-ride and i’m having the time of my life. it’s a playground for my imagination. an amusement park full of fun and thrills that changes by the minute … \n\ndigital 1/1 art by e9Art using VQgan-Clip, April 2022 … 10000x10000\n",
