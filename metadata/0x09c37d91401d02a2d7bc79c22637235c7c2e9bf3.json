    "description": "The artwork is inspired by Lithuanian folklore and folk art, reflecting on how communication connects us, whether it is spoken language, pattern language, or programming language.  For the artwork, the author chose the legend of the founding of Vilnius and converted the text into binary code, which was turned into a pixel image, reminding Lithuanian folk textiles and patterns. Encoded legend in the digital artwork was a starting point to an evolving story, the developing history of Vilnius and Lithuania up to modern days, full of technologies and digital content. It is a structure, network of new stories, connections, achievements, and legends. Inspired by the unique heritage and impressive development of the ICT industry in Lithuania, EPAM collaborated with contemporary digital artist Lauryna Narkevičiūtė to make the legend live in a digital world.",
