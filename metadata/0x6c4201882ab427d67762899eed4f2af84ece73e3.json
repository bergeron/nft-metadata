    "description": "Edition 1/1 from the Storms of Life Collection. Each image in this collection tells one part of the story.\n\nThis is the genesis piece of the collection.  It is about how empty, afraid and hollow the storms of life can leave you.\n\nStory behind the collection: \n\nFor too long I let the storms of life ruin my day. I wasted away waiting for fate to change the weather. One day I thought, “So what if I get wet or cold? I want to enjoy life!” The storms of life never entirely went away, but now I look forward to playing in them.\n\nThe idea for this collection came out of one of the hardest times in my life. Divorce, financial ruin, death of loved ones and more.  Suicide filled too many of my thoughts.  I wanted to live but I wanted to end my pain. Then at a breaking point, I tried dancing in the rain storms and slowly I found hope.",
