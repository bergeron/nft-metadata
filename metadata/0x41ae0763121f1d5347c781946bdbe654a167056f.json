Never afraid to take risks, a true degenerate behind the cutesy outlook (hence the ring)!\n\nShe entices people with her sypnosis power and the bets keep getting wilder and wilder... until things go south... \n\n\n═════ ★ • ☾ • ★ ═════\n\nThe winner of Fumiko will receive an animated PFP through FND if the final bid is more than 0.5 ETH, otherwise, it will still be given through Polygon!\n",
