    "description": "This Special Nanoz is part of the Halloween 2022 Lore \"The Gargoylz Awakening\".\n\nA long time ago, after an exhausting battle, three brave Knights regained control of the Nanzacur Castle.\n\nTo celebrate the victory, they invited all villagers to a great feast. They laughed and danced through the night.\n\nAt dawn, as they were leaving the banquet room to go rest, Carnaloz the Dark Mage, appeared through a cloud of smoke in front of their eyes. Before they could reach their swords, Carnaloz cast a spell and the three Knights were changed into stone Gargoylez.\n\nIt was on the 31st night of October of the year 3 A.P. (After Primalz). To this day, the legend says that every year during Halloween night the Gargoylz awaken for a few hours and and can be seen flying around Nanzacurâ€™s dungeon.",
