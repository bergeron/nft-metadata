    "description": "Only art makes life possible. Man cannot be understood within the framework of physiology. Humans are not a series of chemical reactions since metaphysics is also involved. We are only truly alive once we realize we are creative, a creator and a creature of art. What encourages me to be more creative include my emotional processes in the moment and the extent to which they affect my portraits that can amaze even me.",
