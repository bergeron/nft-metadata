    "description": "Clouds in Dubai are very rare but when you see them, expect the magical sunset or sunrise. Also, most of these wonderful sunsets happen during weekdays when you are sitting in your office trying to finish the dayâ€™s tasks. In such situations as a passionate photographer, you miss many chances to capture such beautiful moments.\n\nThis evening was no different but somehow I managed to leave the office a little early, reached this location exactly when the sun was going down the horizon, and quickly set up my time-lapse. The color in the sky was so magical that I couldn't do justice with any words. This shot is a stack of 2 shots. The lights in the building were stacked from the latter shot of the time-lapse.",
