    "description": "In his series, Dear Winter, Franck Bohbot wandered the streets of New York City in December 2020 (when he decided to move back to the city that made him a photographer), seeing what impact a major cold spell of ice and snow coupled with the ongoing social restrictions had on one of the world's greatest cities. His resulting images are atmospheric, misty, and devoid of the usual city crowds, as we see Manhattan buried under a blanket of snow. Looking at the empty scenes, it's as though the whole of New York is asleep. Even so, the mood is rightly cautious.\n\nThe Photograph \"Back Home\" is a real scene captured in the west village, showcasing the loneliness of a man walking back to his home slowly in the middle of one of the coldest nights of this year, and a metaphor for the whole world going back home during this period of time when nothing was sure.",
