    "description": "I have always been an observer of the world where humans are the heart of my work.\n\nDuring all my travels, I like to feed on the secret and moments of the people around me.\n\nThrough my eyes, I perceive them with my \"filter of humanism\" and reflect them to you with my own\nemotions.\n\nEveryone can find themselves in my work, find a piece of themselves and their own story.\n\nUnconsciously they will invite you to recall some \"not so important\" memories and help you revive them.\n\nIt will encourage you to start your own inner journey and help you enjoy the moment.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nCan also sell real wire art version.\nFor more information, contact me through Twitter or Instagram.\n\nDigital Illustration\n\n4750 x 7000 px",
