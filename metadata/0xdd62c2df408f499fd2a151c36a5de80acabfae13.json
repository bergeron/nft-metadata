    "description": "This is a picture of a transwoman in Kerala.  From the moment he recognizes the femininity in the body he started a new life as a woman. It was not an easy journey in an orthodox society and the path was incredible. The pains she feels are indescribable.  Although the law has opened the doors of freedom to her, However, society should open too.  Not only their identity but also their freedom of outfit are being questioned by the so-called literate people. She wants to portray her body to the world and simply say that they are not different people, and try to consider them as human beings.\n\nPhoto by Manoop Chandran\n\nEdition -  1 / 1\n \nYear -  2021\n\nCamera & Lens -  Canon 1 dx Mark 2 , 85 mm 1.2\n",
