    "description": "A 3D version of the masterpiece by Rembrandt.\n\nI've been always fascinated by \"The Man with the Golden Helmet\" painting (c. 1650) oil on canvas, formerly attributed to the Dutch painter Rembrandt and today considered to be a work by someone in his circle.\nFor a long time, I wanted to do a thorough 3D sculpt and rendering and finally, I made it! \n\n",
