    "description": "I woke up very early at Lake Nakuru that morning, walking with my tripod, camera, and a couple rolls of B&W films. It was that kind of magical moment when everything came into place and was definitely breathtaking. The little rocky road that I was standing on, a couple of leaves falling trees in the foreground, the dawn light warming my hands, the peaceful lake water, the silk like morning fog floating just above the lake surface, created this dream-like tranquil atmosphere for my volunteer trip in Kenya.\n\nNFT File size: 4.4 Mb\nFormat: jpg\nDimensions: 5000x5000\nEdition type: 1/1\n\n\n\nCollector(s), who meet the following criteria, receives the artist numbered and signed handmade enlarged print developed in darkroom.\n\n\n\nSee link below for more details and full descriptions of the image:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3RppCEJ",
