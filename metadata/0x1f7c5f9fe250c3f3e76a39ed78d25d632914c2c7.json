    "description": "Hennythings Possible was shot almost a year after its inception in 2016 as Vintage and her team did not anticipate such a huge reception from the audio release. After the placement in NBA2K18, a visual needed to be created immediately. Vintage made it evident that she wanted her hometown Roxbury displayed all throughout the video. Vintage and the team shot this video in the freezing cold (under 20 degrees) but itâ€™s a classic video shot in the heart of historical Roxbury. The song has transcended throughout many musical eras and made its way into season 2 episode 2 of HBO's \"Euphoria\".\n\nProduced by: Tee-WaTT\n\nDirected by: a_ciggs & Lauren Tyler Brimeyer\nCo directed by: Vintage Lee \nVideoProduced by: Sharlea Brookes",
