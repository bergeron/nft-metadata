    "description": "Photographed on the family farm, I stopped one morning to buy a dozen of fresh eggs from the small, wooden stand, and out of the barn strolls Tim, covered head to toe with dirt and hay.\n\nAn eager, mild mannered man, Tim and I spoke for awhile about life during a brisk Autumn morning after sparking a conversation when he saw my camera.\n\nHe told me about how he grew up across the street from the farm in the house I was looking at, and how he inherited that same house later on. It’s been in his family for multiple generations and most likely will stay within it.\n\nTim’s son and daughter in law now do most of the work around the farm. Tim’s taken a small step back after a career in fire fighting and farming over the last 40 years in the community.\n\nIt seems that Tim’s just fine to live easy in Etna, New Hampshire for sometime to come.\n\nEtna, New Hampshire, c. 2022",
