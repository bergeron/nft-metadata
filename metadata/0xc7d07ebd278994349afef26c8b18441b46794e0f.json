    "description": "On the evening of May 16, 2021, the Sudan to Earth, TX Supercell promptly marked its place in history as the storm structure highlight of the 2021 season. As sunset approached and the storm transitioned into an entirely new shape, it became apparent I was about to witness one of the most incredible shows the sky had ever offered me. \n\nThis moment marked not only what I thought to be the climactic moment of the storm's life cycle, but a climactic moment in my chasing and photography career. Hundreds of thousands of miles, tens of thousands of dollars, years of work, and more shutter clicks than I could ever hope to count had led me to this exact spot, at this exact moment, and allowed me to capture the raw beauty of my obsession more perfectly than I ever had before. This is a life time moment. This is one of my most prized memories. \n\nThis is Climax.\n",
