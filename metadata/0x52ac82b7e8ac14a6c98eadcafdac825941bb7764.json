    "description": "\"We seem to be made to suffer.\"\n\nC3PO v2 A New Hope\n\nCreated by Jim Furey in 2022, the GLXY:LOVE project is an exercise in typographic design. Jim took inspiration from Robert Indiana’s 1966 landmark piece LOVE which later evolved into the world-famous LOVE sculpture in Philadelphia, PA. This art series celebrates our favorite galaxy, far, far away, through a unique visual lens. Each design is artfully handcrafted to maintain the look and feel of Mr. Indiana’s original art, with a few ‘special modifications’ added when necessary. Trust us; each piece has it where it counts.\n\n6000 x 6000 px\nJPG",
