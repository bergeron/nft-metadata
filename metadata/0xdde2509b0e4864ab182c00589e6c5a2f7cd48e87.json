    "description": "To celebrate the 25th anniversary of one of the original memes. I decided to redraw my original creation. I created Bert Is Evil in March 1997, in the early days of the World Wide Web. \n\nBert is Evil is known as one of the first memes. It was celebrated in the 2nd Webby Awards in 1998 and won the Weird and People's Voice Award category. \n\nIn 2001, the website became linked to Osama Bin Laden as an image of Bert with the terrorist showed up in posters in a protest in Bangladesh.\n\nThis NFT celebrates the first web phenomenon to transcend the internet and become mass media. Bert is Evil appeared on CNN, FOX NEWS, NPR, and many newspapers when the internet was a fringe medium. It feels appropriate for it to come back and become part of the new digital format.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_is_Evil",
