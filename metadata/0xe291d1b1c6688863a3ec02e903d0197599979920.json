    "description": "This series of four photographs as editions of 25 provide a look into the neons of a fading Americana culture across the country - a community collaboration with Proof Collective.\n\nFrom the Rust Belt, to the American Southwest, Neon has been used for decades as a way to provide character and atmosphere to the location. Over the last four decades, Neon has slowly become less and less common, signifying an end of an era for these small rural towns across America.\n\nEl Rancho Motel  \nGallup, New Mexico  \n2023  \nEdition of: 25",
