    "name": "Kinetic Light Sculpture I",
    "description": "Inspired by the kinetic and optical art works of the mid-20th century, the kinetic light digital sculpture series pays tribute to all those pioneering artists of the post-avant-garde era. Today, digital design software tools and code language begin to open new avenues of artistic exploration. The work is a reformulation of those past artistic expressions, still contemporary today. Kinetic digital light sculptures do not emit or receive light, yet their geometric lines, shape, and movement appear to do so. Simple geometric figures capable of transforming our perception of a world in which nothing is what it seems.",
