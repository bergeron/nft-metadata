    "description": "After a terrible nuclear war that devastated the world in 1965, 3 superstates are formed. The year is 1984 and the 3 great powers are declared enemies. In London, Winston is a member of Big Brother's ruling Oceania party, his duty being to rewrite the past so that the party can control the present.  \nDirected by Black Dog and narrated by Raul Veiga, the Film \"1984: The Big Brother Watches You\" is based on the work of George Orwell 1984, presenting in a didactic way a book that many know, but few have read.",
