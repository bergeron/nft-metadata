    "description": "It flows through you and me and everything. It is our meaning and our message, a meaning that may change from second to second. The message is different for everyone who looks upon a piece. It has no boundaries and no limits. I am the medium, the meaning, and the message. I am the subject and the observer. My art is the world. I am my art. Art is simple. Art is everything.\n\nEdition 1/1",
