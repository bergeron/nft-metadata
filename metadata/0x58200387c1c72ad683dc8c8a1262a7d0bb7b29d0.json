    "name": "Call of the Abyss",
    "description": "⚫️The picture is in extremely gloomy, heavy colors. Made in 14 hours. Included a lot of JPG, in closed content. In man, as in the world, there is always a balance. Balance of dark energy and light. These are endless scales that the body balances with its mood, thoughts, and so on. There is no good or evil. Everything is emptiness. But to know the world, people and oneself is impossible without proper self-destruction, without plunging into the abyss or darkness. After all, it is not for nothing that after some trials we become truly hardened. If we are not broken. I wish everyone to find this piece of darkness in their soul and keep it under control. May this call of the abyss be on your side. Thus - making you truly powerful. Peace for everyone. Amen.⚫️\n\n",
