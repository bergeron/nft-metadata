    "description": "PettoKado is a cute collection of 3,333 Pettos that are inspired by anime. Each Petto egg can be hatched into a random animal and these animals have different strengths and weaknesses. Pettos are unique and live in harmony since they know that they are all Pettos.  Our vision is to bring everyone together by turning Pettos into real cards and games.",
