    "description": "The witch stood in the woods, her long hair whirling in the breeze, her arms raised to the heavens. The stars twinkled in the darkness behind her, and a sliver of moon shed an eerie glow on the wildflowers that surrounding her.\n\nA blast of red light erupted from her fingertips with a mumbled spell, illuminating the area in a wavering glow. It was a spell she'd used many times before, but there was something strange about the air tonight. Something ancient and sinister, whispering secrets in her ear and filling her with dread.\n\nShe couldn't shake the idea that this wasn't just any regular night, and that the magic she was using had more power than she had ever known.",
