    "description": "This series is called \"Abandoned planet\" and \nits idea came to my mind on a desolate beach. That night, the moon was hidden behind the clouds, the light was soft and I could barely feel a light breeze blowing. \nThe air was filled with a harmony of loneliness and silence, and only choppy sea could disturb the calm. Where the waves are beating the shore and the clouds are floating by, the lonely \"figures\" stand still on the beach. Only the moonlight is shining on them, and they’re washed not by the ocean, but by the powdery sand. There’s another life of the beach - life in the dark. I tried to convey the loneliness of these \"figures\" and capture their beauty next to the magical water and boundless sky. \nSometimes it even felt like they’ll start moving or even running to the sea, and they’ll dip into the water with their “heads”. \nBut they stood still, stuck in the sand, resting from the daily noise, flaming sun and the cry of seagulls. The nightlife of the “figures\" is quiet and simple.",
