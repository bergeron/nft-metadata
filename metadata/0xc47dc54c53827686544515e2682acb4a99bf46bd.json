    "description": "Eyes from apathetic view of the anatomy and physiology are just optical tools for watching around.\nBut human eyes are also a window to his/her soul. The eyes job goes beyond watching\nFrom this window, love and hatred, hope and fear and despair can be understood.\nThis painting is the importance of the eyes in my life with a little bit of surreal flavor",
