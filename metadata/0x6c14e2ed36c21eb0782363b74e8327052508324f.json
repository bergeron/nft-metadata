    "description": "This art portrays mental health struggles. The art is split into 3 stages of mental health from bottom to top.\nThe lower part is the cause of mental health issues; multiple faces symbolise the inability of a person to make harmony between the various aspects of oneself. The wings at the back of the head signify the unfocused hopping mind, which flies from one idea to another. The blackness in the eyes and the mouth is the Unfathomable abyss of evil thoughts and experiences.\nThe middle part of the head shows the side effects of mental health issues, which grew until they became gruesome monsters like depression, anxiety, paranoia, etc. As we know, all our thoughts, good or bad, all our horrors are just the popping of enzymes between brain tissues; the one-eyed Eldritch brain monster with multiple tentacles signifies the same.\nAt the top, a tiny light between shadows is the hope of liberation. Never lose hope; nothing is permanent.\nTools: Procreate\n",
