    "description": "This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, \nto cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. \nFirst to let go of life. \nFinally, to take a step without feet.\n- Rumi\n\nBlack and white photography is a secret passion of mine, and this is one of my all-time favorite photographs from Istanbul, Turkey.  I am dedicating a poem by the great Persian poet Rumi to it. \n\nThe first collector will receive a fine art print on museum quality paper. \n\nA 4288 x 2848 pixel digital file is also included. \n\n\n\n#streetphotography #photography #blackandwhite #documentary #travelphotography #movement\n\n",
