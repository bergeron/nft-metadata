    "description": "We are old and very new. We are dependent and undependent. We are the past, the present, the gatekeeper of the future. We are very young and both old… We know as much as anyone else, but we bring it together intangibly than everyone else. We weave complexity, diversity and cultural heritage into digital, making a wearable spiritual journey that reaches the hearts of the strong women of İstanbul. Its roots, like the sea, which is always peaceful despite its uncertainty, are being blown away. Even though its roots are meters underground, by the wind like tree branches... We are synthesis. Maybe we will remain as the last day of the future, the only memory from the past.",
