    "description": "Happy 420 yall. Time 2 celebrate\n\nChecc this out. There’s a twist.\n\n1 hour to collect the NFT… then tha price starts going up.\n\nEveryone knows who I am, but very few know the legend of my dad, Poppa Snoop. The one who brought me here. He worked behind the scenes with many rappers in the 90s creating and putting out music. This track Let Me Hit Something is a song pulled from the vault of unreleased music that my dad owns and was never doing much with. We call it Poppa Snoop’s vault of classics. “Let Me Hit Somethin”, by Snoop Dogg, and featuring Daz. A&R’d by my pops, Poppa Snoop.",
