    "description": "The local butcher of Aurora since 1965 imagined being around that long and being the main source of meat for a lot of town folk. I have never lived anywhere in my life for more than 3 years so that sounds crazy to me but great at the same time. \n\nThe weirdest thing about this place is when delivery day comes and watching them herd the meat inside through the back on a ramp is just unreal to see. \n\nI wanted to turn this into an edition because I like this photo even though it didn't fully match the style I was going for in “A night in a small town”",
