    "description": "The original statue depicts Giovanni Battista, but it has been digitally modified to create a different effect. The dominant colors are blue and yellow, creating a cold and detached tone. Instead of the subject's face, there is a pattern of glitch art, which is a digital artistic technique that creates distortion and disruption effects.\n\nThe pose of the statue and the glitch art effect work together to create a pensive mood that seems to underline a sense of uncertainty or unease. This type of artistic technique can be seen as a form of social or cultural critique, or as a reflection on the nature of technology and its influence in our lives.\n\nIn general, this combination of traditional and digital elements can be seen as a way to explore new ways of artistic expression and to create a dialogue between the past and present, between technology and culture.",
