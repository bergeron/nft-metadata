    "description": "I decided this time to delete Joe Rogan from a few of my favorite episodes of his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. This is my artistic response to Spotify's Joe Rogan Controversy.\n\nThe Cancel Art series critically responds to the situation regarding cancel culture and social justice warrior. In protest against Cancel Culture, I delete inappropriate people and objects from movies or documentaries.",
