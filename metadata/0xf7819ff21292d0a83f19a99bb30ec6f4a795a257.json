    "description": "The Neon Raiders are a collection of 500 NFTs. Each raider.... well that's all I can say for now. The rest is a mystery. Some raiders are legendary within their clan. Some are just starting out. Some are rare, some are common. Some are special. Some are just plain boring. But all of them are unique. And all of them are yours.",
