    "description": "Chose my favourite shot from that final pre-pandemic trip to Anilao, Philippines as my first unicorn. You might have already noticed, this moonlit seahorse became very personal over the years and started representing me as a photographer in most of my profiles.\n\nI have to confess, it was kind of an accident how I got this image. Me and my friend Andy were trying different light angles to get a backlit shot of this spiny seahorse. While playing with a very closed aperture to capture the shadow around the animal, I noticed my buddy's spot light in distance. It took a few tries to finally replicate an image which was there in my head.\n\nIt was natural to choose monochrome presets while editing, as it allowed me to hide a lot of murky noice around the seahorse and get that final full moon effect. Even when I was processing the shot, I didn't know this will eventually become one of my favourites.\n\nArtist: Shinto (FloodedCamera)\n\nEditions: 1/1\n\nCollection: Unicorns of Blue",
