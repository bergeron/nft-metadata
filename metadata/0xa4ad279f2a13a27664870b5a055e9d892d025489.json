    "description": "Golden hues dance across the endless dunes as the sun sets on another day. The lone wanderer, lost in thought, trudges through the sandy expanse, leaving only footprints behind. The tranquility of the desert envelops them in a sense of peace, and the world seems to fade away. This is 'Dune Bliss'; a moment of pure serenity in the vast and beautiful wilderness.\n\nThe image is part of the \"Earth Witness\" series, that encloses some of the best and most meaningful travel images that I took around the World.\n\nThe NFT comes with the full resolution image and the Rights for printing the image for personal purspose.\n\nDimensions : 4000x5000px",
