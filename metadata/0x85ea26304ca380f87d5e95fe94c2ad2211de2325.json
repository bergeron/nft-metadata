    "description": "On February 24, two Russian warships approached the Ukrainian island “Zmiiny” in the Black Sea. The Russians announced on the radio a demand to turn off communications and lay down their arms. Ukrainians responded by refusing \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself\". The island was shelled from ship weapons and from the air. There are no surviving buildings on Zmiiny. The fate of 13 sailors is unknown, according to some sources they are in Russian captivity.",
