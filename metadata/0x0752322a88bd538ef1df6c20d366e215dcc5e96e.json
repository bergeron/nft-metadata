    "name": "Lightness of mind",
    "description": "The purpose of creating this collection is a new artistic expression of the two triangles of life , and each of the vertices of the triangle has become an artwork . The concepts of the original triangle are based on Milan Kundera's book ((The Unbearable Lightness of Being)) .  And the next triangle is the reaction of the area and the creatures between each turning point in the story.  The name of each work was chosen according to the vertices of the main triangle. We called them Lightness of mind, heaviness of drowning and weightlessness . In this artwork , lightness of mind , we show how the creative imagination is formed behind the eyes in the dark and takes on a real form in the light.  As Napoleon Hill closed his eyes and thought he was sitting at the meeting table with Ford, Darwin, Edison, etc., and we all know that he wrote his most famous book through this way.  Further details are available in the artwork brochure.",
