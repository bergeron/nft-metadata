    "description": "‘Love’ symbolises the Heart Chakra, the Chakra of connection and self-acceptance, blessing its owner with kindness, peace & of course, love in abundance. Each aspect, symbol & setting has been carefully forged to manifest abundance, including a Green Emerald stone for compassion, and my own sigil I personally use for manifesting love in all it’s forms. In the audio realm, the Heart Chakra’s accompanying Solfeggio frequency (639hz) plays alongside the all-powerful ohm & a recording of rainfall, for abundant manifestation. Should they wish, the collector will not only enjoy this piece visually, but as a tool for aligned meditation & active manifestation.",
