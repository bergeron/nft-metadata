    "description": "My “ Xenomorphs cell ” project consists of 4 NFTs with video and music , correlated by the most recent and innovative scientific discoveries in xenobiology and advanced research in biotechnology, with the creation of xeno-DNA with structural chemical changes relative to its natural counterparts using Glycol , Hexose and Threose . \n\nXNA ( Xeno-DNA)  can carry new and alien genetic information as human DNA creating a new new genetic systems for synthetic life ( xeno organism )\n\nIn the fourth NFT \"Xenomorphs cell : threose \" I imagined  XNA with structural chemical changes using  Glycol , creating life xeno cell during meiosis phase of replication. \n\nMusic for : Vcs 3 , Buchla , Granular Synthesis and voice\n\nFor scientific information and bibliography on Xeno genetic research please visit [Xeno Genetic Research Centre](https://sites.google.com/view/roberto-musci-xenobiology/xenobiology)\n\nFor music information on Xenomorphs cells project [music](https://sites.google.com/view/robertomusci)\n",
