    "description": "Inspired by his Original BitBoard collection, Calvyn's Fleur Ex Machina is the first in the evolution of the digital surfboard art style. \n\nWhere the BitBoard collection is more focused on the surfboard, this next development is focused not only on the surfboard but the world & landscapes in which it inhabits too.\n\nWhilst majority of the BitBoard collection has multiple editions, Fleur Ex Machina and it's successors will all be 1/1.\n\nThe owner of Fleur Ex Machina will also be provided with the 3D surfboard.\n\nThe BitBoard collection can be found on Opensea.",
