    "description": "\"Don't judge anyone at the first sight\"\nThe idea for dressing up as a succubus comes from the fact that many women feel pressured to conform to societal expectations of sexy attire, rather than embracing their unique, dark, and mysterious side. By incorporating elements related to death, such as dark imagery and macabre accessories, one can break free from societal norms and embrace their true, authentic self.\n\nThis concept also highlights the negative impact of judging others based solely on their appearance and superficial characteristics. Instead of judging or stereotyping someone based on their outward appearance, it is important to understand and appreciate the depth and complexity of an individual's true identity.",
