    "name": "Self Blossom",
    "description": "For the flower to blossom, there should be all appropriate conditions, which impact the process - air, warmth, conditions and circumstances - and time. \n\nThis metaphor describes the process of the creative mind becoming, actually, creative. Air - you breathe with inspirations, with mountain air, with campfire smoke, with images of some dreamy places. Warmth - you feel it from the people surrounding you, you are warmed with the memories. Conditions - you feel overflowed with everything that comes from the outside. Circumstances - the first trip, the first night in the tent, the first iPhone, camera or laptop, the first love, the first disaster - all in all it provides you with an airstrip. \n\nTime - combines each of these factors. And so you simply blossom.",
