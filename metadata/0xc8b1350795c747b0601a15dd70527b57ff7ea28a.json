    "description": "Meditative, string and snake-like drawings that I’ve been drawing since I started my art practice in 2006. They represent the tangled web of thoughts and emotions that we have to deal with every day. For people with anxiety and depression, these balls of stress and emotion can be especially difficult to unravel. Drawing these—and making art in general—is my way of taking care of my mental health.",
