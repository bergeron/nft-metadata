    "description": "In one of the occupied cities of Ukraine there is a family that keeps two racehorses. They are trying to leave the war zone and need financial support to pay all transfer expenses and find a new home, as well as bribes to take the horses alive. According to rough estimates, they will need at least $ 10k to gather a family, pick up horses and leave to build a new life. I drew this work on February 23rd, and on the 24th the war began, and I, like many, was forced to leave for safety without having time to publish it. Now I understand that she was waiting for this moment all that time. All proceeds from the sale of this work will go to help this family. ",
