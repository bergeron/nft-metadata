    "description": "Mothers play an important role in everyone’s lives. Having a mother in our life is a gift. From giving birth to a child, taking care of their children. As everyone knows motherly love is incomparable. Mother’s arm is the most comfortable place when you feel sad, depressed, afraid, or lonely. Mother keeps you strong. Behind all the successful stories, the mother will be there. Whether you are going to a school, college or office, she supports you. Mother is the only person who wants to see their children happy no matter how they treat her in return.",
