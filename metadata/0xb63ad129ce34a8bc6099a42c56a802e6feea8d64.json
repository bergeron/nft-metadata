    "description": "Cyclical dreamscapes that are reproduced during night recharges.\nThe dream study was developed by a screenwriter who was inspired by the phrase \"Waiting for the weather by the sea...\"\nInstalled in the root system of mannequins of the \"Worker\" class, to suppress ambitions and desires.\nAs a side product of artificial intelligence.\nIn this dream, the mannequins go through cycles of realization of emerging ideas by dancing.\nIn the morning, turning on and starting their new day, the mannequins feel the full realization of their ambitions and desires of the highest order.\nDespite the fact that mannequins of this class still produce EMF. But the quality of the product is low, but at the same time affordable.\n\n",
