    "description": "Planes are not real birds but still flying and majestic...  \n\nThis photograph has a nice story in many ways, here is why:\n\n-This shot was taken at an operative airport from a helicopter, allowing me to fly above working planes and shoot almost what I want.\n\n-It has been awarded in the \"International B&W Spider Awards\" in 2020, 5th place.\n\n-It's an animated piece paired with a physical piece for Augmented reality use, you can print it yourself with a high-quality file provided.\n\nThe animation overlays on physical print when viewed through your phone.  \nHere is the example video:  \nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/BFZCeuyEUsc?feature=share\n\nWhen I started animating this piece it gave it a second life, improved my creativity and to me, build a bridge between physical and digital art.",
