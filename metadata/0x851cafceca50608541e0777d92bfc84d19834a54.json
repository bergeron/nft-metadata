    "description": "The past few months have been a bit of a transition period for me. Last year, I had both personal wins and losses. I lost a few grandparents in 2021, but also got engaged to the love of my life. I’ve reflected on what balance and peace mean to me and continue to re-define that for myself in my late 20’s. It explores that feeling, but as celebration. \n\nI went through a months long period of not creating any new McClenney material after my album last year. This was one of the first things I’ve made this year since being back. I believe NFT’s give artists the opportunity to write and tell their narrative on their own terms.\n\nI’ve been an independent artist my entire career by choice and this freedom has always been important to me. We’re entering a new era and it’s an honor to drop peaces.1 as my first NFT. Written, produced and mixed by me, I truly loved writing this one. hope you enjoy it.",
