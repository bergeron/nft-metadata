    "description": "Loro Piana has partnered with Charlotte Taylor, a digital artist who explores the beauty of engineering. In this series of artworks Charlotte explores the journey of The Gift of Kings - the world's finest Merino wool - from farm to final finishing. As Charlotte says “the fibre is the essence of any garment - it’s like its DNA - so I wanted to see it looping and folding, weaving the garments together”.",
