    "description": "This boy is smiling, looks comfortable yet he's suffering. He is not putting on clothes, his pants looks faded and he is riding on the back of a bicycle.\n\nSome of us have been too long in that undesirable situation and have resolved to live with it.\n\nThis is the same way many of us are living in an uncomfortable condition or situation while still trying to put on a smile.\n\nUnhappy where we are but too lazy to take on new adventures of life. Not comfortable where we are but too complacent to take a bold, brave step.\n\nMany worker's rights are being violated everyday but they refuse to speak out because they fear they'll lose their only source of living., They prefer to continue to endure despicable working conditions they are subjected to daily.\n\nPeople's rights are being violated all over the world like in the case Iran and yet our leaders are there sitting ducks, doing nothing concerning it.",
