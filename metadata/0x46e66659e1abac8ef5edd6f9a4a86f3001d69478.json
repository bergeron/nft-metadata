    "description": "I was drawn to this location so that I could experience and photograph the first snows of winter, in a place that has become infamous in American history. Donner Pass Road leads directly to the Donner Pass, a narrow rocky gap in the northern Sierra Nevada in California, near the town of Truckee. During the winter of 1846 a site beneath the pass became the location for one of the United State's saddest human tragedies. A group of 87 emigrants travelling east to west were caught in a terrible snow storm, which trapped at them at the foot of the mountain. The snow drifts were 26 feet deep. It was not long before their animals died. Slowly, as they ran out of food the group began to starve. One by one they succumbed to the terrible conditions. With no other food to eat it was decided that the only way to survive was to eat the bodies of their dead travelling companions. After months trapped in the ice and snow only 45 of the group survived and were eventually able to make it to California.",
