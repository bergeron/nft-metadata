    "description": "This series is about the simple things that usually stay behind our tables. \nThe aesthetics of garbage and leftovers about to go into the trash makes me look at things differently. Here I have a process of exploring cultural experiences and habits, observing the beautiful and the not-so-beautiful.\n\nIn the correlation of time and the fading process, I view this through the prism of human exhaustion of inner resource. Feelings of apathy and crush are inherent in all living things in this world. So this kind of human connection to the imperfection of consumer products, amoral contemplation of the imperfections of the object, and drawing attention to the most rabid problems of consumption through focusing on color accents, forms, and ways of expression through visual language.",
