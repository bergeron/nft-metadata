    "description": "Wrapped in soft pita bread,  \nShawarma is a treat to be fed.  \nLayers of meats and spices,  \nSo delicious, it entices.\n\nMarinated for hours on end,  \nThe flavors blend and blend.  \nOnions, tomatoes, and tahini,  \nA symphony of flavors, mini.\n\nCooked on a spit, it turns,  \nJuices and flavors it earns.  \nA street food, a quick meal,  \nBut it always makes you feel.\n\nSo next time you're feeling peckish,  \nShawarma should be your dish.  \nTasty and satisfying,  \nIt's worth the trying.",
