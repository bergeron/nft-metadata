    "description": "This image was taken in March of 2015, after the Mississippi Valley experienced its wettest winter in 124 years. Melting snow and excessive rain up north made its way down the Mississippi River. As the river approached flood stage (17 ft at the New Orleans gauge), the decision was made to open the Bonnet Carre Spillway, which is a flood control operation connecting the river to the lake.\n\nThe mixing of the muddy river water with the lake's brackish water is an event that can be seen from space. This photo was taken right along the Mississippi River banks at the Bonnet Carre Spillway. This piece also serves as the beginning of a new chapterâ€”the decision to release my work under my name, Andre Messina.",
