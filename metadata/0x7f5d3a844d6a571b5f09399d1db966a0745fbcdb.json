    "description": "C/2022 E3 - Proposal Step 1 - 5th February 2023\n\nUnder the night sky and the northern lights of Iceland, I ask my girlfriend the all-important question....\n\nWith it the green shining comet C/2022 E3, which is to be seen only every 50,000 years.\n\nDepending on what her answer will be, you can burn your Step 1 token and get Step 2. Be sure, at the end of this journey we will have experienced a story together. So maybe it makes sense to always keep a Step. \n\nAnd of course there is a roadmap for this story. We'll see if it goes according to plan or if I have to think of alternatives.",
