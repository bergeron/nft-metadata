    "description": "The video \"suture\" deals with body and space. With a space between reality and imagination. It shows in three parts a kind of humanization in a digital space and plays with hors-champ / off-screen-effects. The first part shows the reconstruction of bodies in memory and the dissolution of bodies. The second part shows a kind of sculpture in the centre. Inside the glas sculpture there is the rest of a body. A mouth. An artefact. The third part shows a kind of reconquest of a body through physical movements and rhythm. In the video you can recognize only parts of bodies. Heads, hands and hair. The rest of the analog world. Nobody knows what will come next. If there will be pictures/images left. Something tangbile.\n\"Suture\" is a term in film theory. Kaja Silverman and VALIE EXPORT used the term before and they are my references for this work.",
