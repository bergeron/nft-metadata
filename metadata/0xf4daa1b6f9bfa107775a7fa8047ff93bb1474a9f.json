    "description": "It’s more than 20 years nowadays that I attend mountains, maybe almost  twice if I consider the time my parents brought me with them to discover this place. Mountains and Photography give me the strength to go on day by day in my daily life. Because Life often is hard and you have to get a support from something that keep your mind apart . What will happen later? I love this environment and I think it will stay inside of me for the rest of my life and behiond. But life a day will come to an end, and what will happen later? I can’t imagine a new dimension without mountains, surely it will be something similar to this world, but upside down. There will be still a lots of mountains to climb and new lands to explore. \nYes, I’m sure my Eden will be surely like this. \nThis is - the only way.\n\nAuthor: Lorenzo Tonello\nDate: May, 2022\n",
