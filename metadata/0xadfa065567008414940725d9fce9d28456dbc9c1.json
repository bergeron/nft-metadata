    "description": "In the metaverse, streetwear isn't confined to the rules of the physical world. So what better way to keep you warm than a flaming beanie and a cloud hoodie?\n\nInspired by a conversation between RTFKT and Bobby Hundreds on Bomb Talk episode 104. RTFKT discussed their approach to design by taking cues from video game skins which tend to be more over-the-top in design and in gaming this attributes to a skin's value and rarity. This type of thinking is what will push fashion forward in the metaverse.\n\nCreated using Adobe Illustrator, Animate, and After Effects.",
