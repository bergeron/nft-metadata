    "description": "The last homely strongholds north-west of the seas, once home of those imbued with magic, these ancient towering structures are scattered throughout what today is a fertile retreat. Enchanted writings still echo these valleys. Mortals refer to them as \"the spires in the clouds\". Travellers of these regions murmur prayers to the elders of the timeways, high ground sorcerers waging unimaginable power.",
