All of my frustrations and failures have brought me to a place of understanding, and I'm learning to embrace the present and the lessons that it teaches me. As the saying goes, 'When the student is ready, the teacher will appear'. Those that have been present in my past, in my dreams, and in my heart are the people that are here now. I see them everywhere, in the most unlikely of places. I see the sweetest smiles, the most innocent of laughs, and a peace that surpasses all understanding. I know that I'm chosen, that I'm here for a reason, and that I have a purpose. I will accomplish everything that I'm destined to do, and that is a promise.",
