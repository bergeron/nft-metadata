    "description": "The foundation to my entire life in art will always be music. My love for digital art came from my passion of making music. Making album covers and promos for new songs is what drove me to further explore different mediums of art and this is my nod to what was such an influential and special part of my life. To all my fellow creatives out there making music and chasing a dream I tip my hat to you and hope you never stop doing what you love!",
