    "description": "Kitsune are the parallel spirits of Oni Ronin. In the real world, they have the appearance of a fox, but in the Oni Realm, their true form emerges. Each Kitsune is completely unique, composed of strange and sometimes terrifying elements from across space and time. Kitsune can be allies, escorts or deceptive antagonists but in every case, they are eternally bound to your Ronin's soul",
