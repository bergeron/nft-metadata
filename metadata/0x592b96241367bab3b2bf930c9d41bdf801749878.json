    "description": "Murakami Lucky Cat Coin Bank Feeding Game is a game that utilizes the NFTs that can be obtained by smashing Murakami Lucky Cat Coin Banks open.\n\nWhen you feed your Murakami. Flower Coins into the Fat Cat Coin Bank, the appearance of the cat evolves into a variety of versions in progression.\n\nCould it be that for those who manage to evolve their Cat Coin Banks to the top level, the beckoning cat will bring in some kind of good luck…?\n\nMurakami.Flowers NFTs (including any NFTs airdropped to Murakami.Flowers owners) are subject to the Collector Terms available here: https://murakamiflowers.kaikaikiki.com/collector.html.\n\nIf you buy a Murakami.Flowers NFT, you do not receive commercial rights in the corresponding artwork.\n\n©Takashi Murakami/Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd.
