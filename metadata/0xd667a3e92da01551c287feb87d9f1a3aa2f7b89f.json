    "description": "It's the Sunday after George Floyd's murder, and over 50,000 people are protesting in Hollywood and Vine's streets.\n\nMany residents are watching from their building's rooftops, and shops have their doors and windows boarded up to prevent looting.\n\nThe military showed up earlier this morning. The glittery sidewalk is lined with tanks and sandbags.\n\nThere are military personnel stationed up and down Hollywood Blvd, but if you look into their eyes, its easy to see they don't want to be there. The uniform and face masks make it hard to tell from a distance.\n\nThe energy in the air is hectic. People are pissed off and yelling. A small group of caucasian men wearing all black is raging in the officers' faces.\n\nSuddenly, a young woman leading a group of protestors climbs on top of a car holding a mega-phone and an upside-down American flag.\n\n\"WE ONLY LOSE IF THEY SUCCEED IN DIVIDING US!\" The young republican exclaimed",
