    "description": "If you ask google to define ‘Kinnar’, it will say स्वर्ग के गायक। Which loosely translates to the singers of heaven. Then why does an entire community get sidelined and ignored, why don’t they have the freedom to choose, to be, to love?\n\nSilent protest is a piece that takes you through the reds. You're brave, you're accepting. You are a part of the riot, the riot of love. So here, come be a part of the silent protest with us. ",
