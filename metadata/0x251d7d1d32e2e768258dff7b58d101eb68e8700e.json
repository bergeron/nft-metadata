Iranian artists are not Iran's regime.  \nThis NFT Collection is a Protest to Opensea Banning Artists due to politics in countries such as Iran, Cuba, Syria, and so on.  \nThis Collectible is here on ERC-1155 Smart-contract to show that Opensea is centralized but the blockchain is not,  \nyou can't stop the power of decentralization and this collection will be available on every marketplace supporting the ERC-1155 contract!  \nAll the income from this collection will be used to make a Decentralized NFT Marketplace For everyone including Iranian Artists so they can continue their NFT Journey in Peace!",
