    "description": "“Spell Chest” - Good Boy William. Dec 2022.\nLooping Video: 1 min 4 sec. 2048px w. 3584px h.\n\nPrimary sale includes the first edition physical archival print signed and numbered on Mulberry Washi paper. Full resolution video file available upon request. \n\nDrawing inspiration from game emblem design, “Spell Chest” explores humanity’s fascination with little symbols, their powerful allure, and how deeply ingrained they are in our digital lives. The piece, which is hand-sculpted and animated frame by frame in virtual reality, creates an abstracted middle space in which physical and digital experiences and existences converge – a strange realm with powerful arbiting forces that make decisions beyond our grasp. \n\nSound design by Erik Shiboski\n",
