    "description": "ocean wave is an unreleased demo track that is really special to me. It is an attempt to capture the emotion of swimming in the ocean after a long lockdown that didn't allow me to travel. It was a release of stress and negativity that had surrounded many of us at the time. I remember vividly, the feeling of relief that had taken over me. \n\n\nMy favorite thing about it is the guitar melody which I got to record at the beach afterward. It just felt special so I wrote the rest of the track around that. Hope you enjoy it!",
