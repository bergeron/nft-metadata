    "description": "As I leaf through the ancient pages of this monastery, I can't help but feel the presence of those who have long passed. Each page is a window into another time, another place. This one, in particular, speaks of beginnings- the creation of the world, of man, and of the divine. It is a sacred text, passed down through the ages, and it fills me with a sense of awe. \n\n I am the beginning and the end. I am the one who is always there, and the one who is always new. I am the one who is discovered with every new page, and the one who remains hidden in the depths of the old.",
