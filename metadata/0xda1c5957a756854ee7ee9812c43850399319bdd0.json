The Keys also grant VIP entrance at all public concerts, conferences, and festivals, which we co-organize through our broadening partnership network. As for the financial utilities, a part of our forthcoming Musiverse Token ($MSV) will be offered to the NFT Holders, while they will have the privilege to participate in the official pre-sale of $MSV in 2023. Our Musiverse Token is designed to serve the governance of the whole Musiverse DAO & Ecosystem. For their artistic benefits, NFT holders have the privilege of minting the the exclusive song selection of our partner, Housematic Radio.",
