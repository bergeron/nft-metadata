    "description": "Desiring to limit color use while hoping to create depth and shadow, this piece is an interplay between my fascination with realism and abstractionism in art. Using mostly charcoal brushes in procreate (and a few other types of brushes for specific use cases), then transferring to photoshop to tweak and modify in order to get the exact feel I wanted. I wanted to created something visually striking but limited by color while communicating intricacy and emotion. \n\nTo you the collector, what do you see? \nComment on my twitter your answer to be airdropped a special release.",
