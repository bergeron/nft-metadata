    "description": "Gianni Lee is releasing a series of NFTs that discusses technology's relationship with the physical world. Advancements in critical technological areas have shaped our planet, our livelihood and how we spend our resources. Crypto and its disruptive forces have made the future even more interesting, and it continues to show the power of technology for the purposes of abundance. But is there such a thing as too much advancement?  \nAs an artist Lee struggled with his relationship with technology, and questioning if evolution was needed in his work, especially as it comes to painting that includes a digital multimedia practice.\nThis research led him to NFTs, a perfect challenge, to make his digital work as substantial as his physical. \nThis NFT project is the result of the artist combining animation, digital illustration and his love for anime and evolution in tech.",
