    "description": "Russian troops entered the Ukraine territory on 22 February. 2 days later, on the morning of 24 February the Russian military carried out air and missile strikes throughout Ukraine. President Putin described the operations as ''demilitarizing and denazifing Ukraine''. \n\nPeople who were the targets of Russian artillery started running in other countries. The lucky ones managed to escape the bombs and crossed the border through Romania, Moldova, and Poland. \n\nMandachi Hotel, which is placed in Suceava, a border city to Ukraine, opened its doors to refugees from the very first day. \n\nThis little brave girl was one of those refugees. When we met in the opera saloon, she was shining in the center with her joy.",
