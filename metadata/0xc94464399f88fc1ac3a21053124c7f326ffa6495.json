    "description": "This incredible 5 hour long exposure photograph shows Earths rotation, as seen through the stars spinning, and includes the International Space Station (ISS) flying above Earth. The foreground is filled with ghostly apparition created with artificial light by the photographer. This photograph portrays a 5 hour story from our own existence in a galaxy among billions of galaxies. A minuscule moment of time and yet stunning photograph which puts our very existence into context.",
