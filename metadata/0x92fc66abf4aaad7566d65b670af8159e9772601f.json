    "description": "At the start of my photography journey, I always wanted to try shooting film. But it seemed so complicated and ruthless. Not knowing your results until days or weeks after shooting the roll really intimidated me as a beginner. Fast-forward a year and a few months, I finally decided to pick up my camera and put a roll through it. \n\nTurns out the exact thing that scared me about shooting film, would go wrong. I ended up shooting the entire roll about 3 stops underexposed and had no idea until 2 weeks later...\n\nTwo weeks after I had shot that first roll, I ended up flying to Maui Hawaii for 15 days. I brought along my film camera and 7 rolls of film, hoping that I had figured out why my last roll failed so I didn't make the same mistake. \n\nI ended shooting 5 of the 7 rolls and coming away with results that blew me away. At this point I was hooked on film; I had found the gold. I now shoot film everywhere I travel, having shot 40+ rolls in 8 months.\n\n35mm | Kodak Portra 400\n\n-Ryan Warner",
