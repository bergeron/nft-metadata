    "description": "Rock Your Socks 321 — I Won’t Break by Jessica Aimee Kishner is the second collection Jessica has done under the Rock Your Socks name, but this her first generative collection and it includes her first recorded song, I Won’t Break. Jessica designed all of the artwork including the traits for the generative pieces and the one of ones. She wrote the lyrics for the song I Won’t Break and writing partner Joe Seabe wrote the music. Sam Sznd is the voice that brings those lyrics to life. This collection not only celebrates Down syndrome and Jessica’s individual talents, but a large portion of the proceeds from the mint will fund Jessica’s Down syndrome awareness sticker campaign that gifts young students stickers designed by Jessica for Down Syndrome Awareness Month in October.",
