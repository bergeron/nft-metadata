    "description": "7 ORBS is a digital moiré animation created by Nicolas Sassoon, part of a series of animated optical patterns created from geometric shapes and motifs. Its composition is informed by optical and kinetic art of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the works of Jesús Rafael Soto and Victor Vasarely. The ORBS series is also influenced by science fiction book covers from the collection “Ailleurs et Demain” (Elsewhere and Tomorrow) published in France in 1969.\n\nNicolas Sassoon is a Franco-Canadian artist using early computer graphics to create a wide array of pixelated forms & figures, moiré patterns & architectural structures. This focus on early computer graphics is driven by the sculptural, material and pictorial qualities of this imagery, as well as its limitations and its poetics.",
