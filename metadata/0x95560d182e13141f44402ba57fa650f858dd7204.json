    "description": "Track 1 - Violence\n\nWith this song, I wanted to show people that Drill doesn't have to be about guns and violence to be hard. Produced written & recorded in one day.\n\nLyrics: \nCan’t keep up with the kid\nToo quick more lit than the bud in your spliff\nDon’t miss when I shoot on a track it’s a hit\nCan’t see through the smoke like a crash in the mist \nI’m leaving swift then it’s back to the bits\nOpen the Mac make a track then I dip\nMan will act bad still capping and shit \nWhen there’s man that are actually capping and shit\nDon’t ask for a life that you don’t wanna live\nCos It starts with a knife but it ends with a clip\nSo many men tryna jump on a trend one shot from the skeng make it ends so quick\nI don’t live that life I don’t know what’s it’s like \nI’m just trying to shine a light on what it is\nStop glorifying the violence we need reminding artists influence kids\nLike JME said gotta spit what you live if you live by the gun then so be it\nI just want change like Ho Chi Minh\nAnd there ain’t no cell you could hold me in\nLosing my grip but I’m holding on\nStare at myself like where do you know me from\nHurt but I gotta stay strong\nRebirth on earth but I lived so long\nNow I’ve learned from the burns so I won’t go wrong\nImma win this time but I’m taking it slow\nPlanting the seeds and I’m letting them grow \nBut I got big dreams so I’m letting them know\nAnd they don’t believe how far imma take this\nI’m building my ship while they’re staying afloat\nI patiently wait till the flood hits I built  the arc but there’s only room for one goat ",
