    "description": "It was a dark and stormy night when the rusty gray gates to Candy Corn City slowly creaked open. No one had ever seen its citizens... As the Spoopies slowly emerge from the safe, gray confines of their beloved city, only time will tell how they choose to navigate the human world. Be warned, though, some of them are quite mischievous.\n\nThe Spoopies are a collection of 999 hand-drawn characters, illustrated by [Amara Andrew](https://amaraandrew.com) and inspired by animation from the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nSpoopies are your entry-level membership into the underground web3 social club, the [Future Ghost Society](https://futureghost.co).",
