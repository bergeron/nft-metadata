    "description": "This is our first independent release as PRETTYMUCH after being signed for six years and we couldn’t be more excited to share it with you guys. With this release, you are taking the first steps into our independent journey alongside with us. We started “H2L” about a year ago after Brandon, one of the members, played us his rough demo version of the record. We instantly fell in love with the sentiment it portrayed while also feeling cool and fresh. \n\nA song that originally was about a single love, turned into a record dedicated to the fans who have been with us from the start of PRETTYMUCH 6 years ago. “I can’t believe I’m still here with you,” speaks to the astonishment of the endless support we have received from the fans. “I can see that I’m a whole new person,” is nothing but true. We aren’t the same band that signed that major label contract 6 years ago. We have acquired so much knowledge through experience whilst building the strongest brotherly bond a band has ever seen. \n\nNot only was this record fully written and produced by us, but so are the rest of the records we are excited to share with you guys. We hope that as you listen you hear how much fun we had making this record and we can’t wait to give you guys more. Its only the beginning!",
