    "description": "Now I am making a collection called the war of the ants with the idea of ones and zeros and that the imagination flows when you see the collection just like in an anthill chaos but in strict order and pattern.\nI will make over 100 pcs in different formats.\nWhy it becomes the war of the ants is because of my background as an artist and painting abstract paintings and being able to see the impossible in the possible.\nAlways be creative!\nartbymac.se\n\nThe idea comes from a regular block TV.",
