    "description": "At the beginning any thought is a small seed that travels trough the waters of our mind. if we nurture that thought, it will take root.\n\nIdeas, projects, dreams or our perception of the world and of ourselves\n\nThe masters say that if we root a good seed in a mind of clear waters, the sun will make it grow and flourish.\n\nBut what happens when our first bad thought root in our clean mind and demons start to torture us?\n",
