An evolutionary series of work that gave way to the larger idea of Information Architecture™️ - a collection of contemplative abstract sculptural works and bricolage that I will be showcasing at [Method](https://themethod.art/blogs/exhibitions/information-architecture-by-kunel-gaur) this year. These smaller pieces were assimilated into the larger body of work I created for the show. ",
