    "description": "In 2027 the 辺獄 bug showed up on all the screens of the world at the same time, hacking all technological devices and opening a portal between dimensions. This portal interacted with our plain of existence, infecting its inhabitants and provoking weird circumstances. As we know, many young adults acquired uncontrollable paranormal powers. \nThe scene portrayed in this piece takes place 20 years later the bug events.\n\nAndroid 07 is a weapon of mass destruction that was produced by Altered Memories Incorporated, a huge corporation that for years has made the implanting fake thoughts and visions into the population (with the aid of the L.I.N.D.A. artificial intelligence),its prior source of business. Nobody knows the name of AM Inc.'s founder, a scientist who seems to have single handedly created an army of androids and thought installers, apprentices that are half human and half machine, who master the power of installing data, and not only that, into the human mind.
