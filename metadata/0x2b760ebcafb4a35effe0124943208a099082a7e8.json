    "description": "Being close to nature is one of the things that nourishes us the most.\nWe must integrate and make space for nature in our lives in order to live in harmony with it and once again be a part of it.\n\nHave you noticed that nature is all around you, or have you been oblivious to it? Have you ever taken the time to appreciate a magnificent tree? What are the flowers that bring spring to life with their vibrant hues and scents? What if you could follow the flight of birds? Do you have a sense of the earth beneath your feet? \n\nWe need to allow ourselves to follow the path respecting the natural cycles of life and thus walking a way of love, union and healing.\n\nWe should be able to let go of control and flow in harmony with nature, allowing us to live a more fulfilling life.\n\nArtist: Stela Narayana\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 4016 × 6016px\nLocation: Rio de Janeiro / Brazil\nPhoto taken May 2022\n",
