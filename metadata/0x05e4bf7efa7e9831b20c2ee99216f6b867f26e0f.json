    "description": "2048px x 1638px png\nedition of 1\n\nA generative adversarial network was trained to visualize a “still life” in response to photographs from a ten year exploration of spontaneous arrangements on our studio desk. \n\nIn the original photographs, a turntable and a vase of flowers feature prominently in each image. The needle on the record is a physical depiction of playing music, sound resides in the picture, and the song becomes its title.  \n\nIn Floragenic we watch the computer model struggle to synthesize the creative ephemera and detritus that surrounds us. We find a blistering, smudged, representation immediately identifiable, but stripped of identity and source. Like a nondescript dream object it indicates depth and compassion, but degenerates into veneer upon inspection.\n\nThis Floragenic piece gets its title from an imaginary song name made up by a neural network.",
