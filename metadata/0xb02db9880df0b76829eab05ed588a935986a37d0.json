    "description": "The serene calmness of the Dal Lake.\n\nDal is a Lake in Srinagar, The summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir, India. It is an urban lake, which is the second largest in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir. It is the most visited place in Kashmir by tourists and locals. View of Dal Lake is completely different in 4 seasons.\n\nLife on the Dal lake has its own pace far removed from the urban sprawls of the Srinagar City and boats is the only means of transportation in this world for ferrying kids to schools to take patients to the hospital. The Dal lake is unlike any other place in the world. Hovering white cranes and the reflection of the mighty Himalayas in the water can make the most cynical person fall in love with this place.\n\nAbout this photo\nEdition: 1/1\nDate taken: 17 October 2021\nLocation: Srinagar, Kashmir \nSize: 4000x6000\n240DPI",
