    "description": "The Lotus Queen\n\nThe Lotus Queen is a self-portrait of the artist and creator of The Rising Lotus NFT collection. The Lotus Queen is done in the style of Sad Pepe. Crypto really adopted Sad Pepe in 2016, the same year I had the worst year of my life. After the last wave of notable Pepes, I dove down the rabbit hole and found a deep connection with the sad frog. The Lotus Queen is a digital finger painting on my phone, and a self-portrait is drawn the day I got my wallet drained by a scammer for the first time, just last week. \n",
