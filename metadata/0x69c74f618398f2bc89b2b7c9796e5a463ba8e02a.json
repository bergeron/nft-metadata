    "description": "The Art Piece  \n \nA portrait of Naramat, a female lion in the Maasai Mara, rendered as a woodcut panel and its digital twin by artist Chuma Anagbado. This etched and subsequently hand coloured work on hardwood is an homage to this animal, one of two female members of the Lemuny Pride, and is part of a triptych of works that portray these predators using tracking data and patrol line data provided by Kenya Wildlife Trust. This unique artwork also contains one third of an aphorism, which can be read when all three portions of the triptych are displayed together: “Until the lions have their own historians, tales of the hunt will always glorify the hunter.\" - Chinua Achebe  \n \nThe Collection  \n \nTracing The Wild is built from data reflecting the biosocial interactions and coexistence of lions and human communities in the Mara, and is intended as a way to express the life of these rare predators who are tracked and protected by the innovative conservation organisation Kenya Wildlife Trust.  \n \nNairobi Design Week 2023 Exhibition  \n \nThis exhibition shines a light on Kenya Wildlife Trust's crucial work stewarding the predator ecosystem of the Mara, and 50% proceeds from sales of all Tracing The Wild artworks benefits Kenya Wildlife Trust’s work directly, with 30% going to the artists and 10% to Nairobi Design and 10% to Sovereign Nature Initiative.",
