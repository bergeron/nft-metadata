    "description": "Under the scorching heat of the industrial furnace of the plant, he got a feeling that his workplace would disappear in the nearest days.\n\nThe steel plant was a place of hard work, danger, and sacrifice. The work was exhausting, and the conditions were often dangerous, with molten metal flowing like lava and massive machines clanging and banging all around. But the workers persevered, driven by a sense of duty and pride in their craft. He knew that his work was vital to the world, and he took that responsibility seriously.\n\nIn his hands, the steel plant became more than just a factory; it became a monument to the human spirit, a testament to the power of hard work, dedication, and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nAnd then everything was gone. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nEdition: 1/1\nYear: 2023\nLocation: Mariupol, Ukraine\nDimensions: 6144x4096\nFiletype: JPG",
