    "description": "Romero Britto’s “Who Let the Dogs Out” is inspired in a “Friend in Need”, by American Artist Cassius Marcellus Coolidge. This fun painting places all seven dogs playing poker in a happier, brighter room, enjoying a Friday night gathering. The twist in this painting…there’s a new boss in town! A supporter of progress and equality, Romero swaps one of the characters for a smart and alluring female poodle in red glasses. Watch out, don’t stare too long or she’ll call your bluff! Paul Blair adds, \"I made this one jazzy with a cool vibe - poker, dogs, cigars, boats...jazz! The high life!\"",
