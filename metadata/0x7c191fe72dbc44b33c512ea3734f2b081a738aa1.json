    "description": "Can you find  all the faces? Haunting ruins like these at Angkor Thom are all that remains of the former capital of Angkor Wat, the great Khmer kingdom that ruled the entire Mekong river basin between the 9th and 13th centuries. At the center of this complex is the Bayon, and the Templeâ€™s most distinctive feature are the 200 plus gigantic, serene and smiling stone faces on the many towers which jut out from the upper terrace and cluster around its central peak. Their enigmatic gazes guard the walls of the city giving one the feeling that they are watching your every step.",
