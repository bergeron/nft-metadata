    "description": "In honor of Pride Month “Freedom Bass” is a celebration of the radical and connective power of dance music. A disco-house track and call-to-arms for the queer and dance communities alike. \n\nA nostalgic, yet forward-thinking track, “Freedom Bass” a lyrical call to action for resistance and change set against a mashup of disco and 90’s house. Written during the pandemic, in the heart of lockdown, the song is filled with melancholy and a desire to return to the dance floor, surrounded by joyful crowds and uninhibited self-expression. \n\n“Freedom Bass was the first song that we ever wrote together in the basement of Boy Untitled's LA home during quarantine. This was long before we decided to become a boy band (lol) and like most first sessions, we were just feeling each other out to see if we would catch a vibe. We put the track down only to return to it a year later. Little did we know that this would become the thesis of BOY2K: 'The dance floor is the revolution...this is Music For The People.' Our mission as artists is to create spaces for people to come back \"home\" to. Spaces to find ourselves. Spaces to connect. Space to riot against systems of oppressions. Spaces to imagine the new world that we want to create together.\"\n\nBOY2K’s mission is to make “Music For The People,” that is, music that celebrates the power of community. A community built in mutual support, love, acceptance and music that begs the listener to get up and move!\n\nLearn more about BOY2K at www.boy2k.com.",
