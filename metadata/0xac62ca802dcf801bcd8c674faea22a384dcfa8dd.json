    "description": "I've been wanting to mint imppossible figure on the Ethereum for a long time and finally it happened!  \nThe open edition \"Starry Sky Portal\" is available from 2023-02-22 to 2023-03-01 at a price of 0.008 ETH\n\nExploring the geometry of shapes, I create architectural artworks with artistic intent, often using optical illusions and impossible shapes, as in this work, which embodies a kind of gateway to the starry sky.  \nThe figures are formed in a contradictory way, creating a visual illusion. For this object, perspective and shadow fall play a key role, which makes it impossible for such a thing to exist in the real world or possible, but only from a certain angle of observation.\n\nEverything is so loud and fleeting that it sucks with your head and body, you don't have time to be happy, think about high things, enjoy the moments and details that overwhelm our world. The work calls for \"taking a step\" to the stars, to yourself, to enjoy the silence, to be at peace and catch your breath.\n\nOriginal generative artwork by Mar—Å Maurer imitates the style of a book engraving, dotted lines and paper texture, created in p5js and has parameters of 2600 x 3400 px, PNG",
