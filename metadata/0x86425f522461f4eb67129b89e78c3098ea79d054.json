    "description": "underneath is our 3rd original release on sound.xyz. it was also the first cudos release of 2022. since it's part of our debut album we believe that it rightfully deserves to have a home on sound along with the rest of the album.\n\none cool aspect about underneath is that it was the first project we made for our debut album. it started out as a collab back in december 2020 with our friends Levity. after about 2-3 sessions over zoom the bulk of the production was pretty much done.\n\nthen a month later we (cudos) flew out to LA for the first time to meet some friends & work on music. during this trip we met up with Kyle Reynolds for a poke bowl lunch date. afterwards we ended up heading back to his place to write a song. we showed him underneath and he immediately loved it so we started working. within that 1-2 hr session we wrote the entire demo for underneath & not much changed about the song from that moment.\n\nwe couldn't be more grateful to have worked with these guys (Levity & Kyle) for our album. not only did the collab create a song we're super proud of but also started a great friendship with john & pj. so strong that 7 months later we started a boyband together during a writing camp in chicago. on top of that, meeting kyle & writing with him was very enlightening for us as artists. he was one of our first in person sessions & it's actually insane considering the caliber of work he's put out. we learned so much from him in that one session...\n\nwe can't thank them enough for their patience & expertise, so shout out to u guys, we love u!
