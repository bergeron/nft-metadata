    "description": "Artist  Christopher FLORENTINO\n\n\"“Be One” Acrylic and oil on canvas 150 x 150 cm  Asking Price: $ 17,500\" For Hardcopy print.\n\n\nFlore is an American artist who aims to strip away all of the filters society places on our lives, all of the habits we get stuck in, the rules we blindly follow, and the stereotypes we subconsciously subscribe to. Flore’s passion for painting and love for art history is prevalent in his works, his distinct style\nmerges pop art and street art together. Using written words with layers upon layers of meaning both partially concealed and exposed, the artist attempts to deconstruct and reveal those layers for what they really are. There might be a lot of distractions upon one of his canvases but with a closer look it is clear they exist to represent how wrapped up we can all become with these habits and rules in our daily lives.\n",
