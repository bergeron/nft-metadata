    "description": "“Your world is extremely beautiful, full of hurts and love”\n\nArtist 'Yeji', who turns 19 years old in 2022, released a work called 'Yeji', which expresses herself based on her own selfies by crossing the boundaries between reality and ideal, real and fake.\n\nThe direction of this unique self-portrait is like the story of the artist herself, who is on the border between adults and minors. It completes this artwork's odd atmosphere with straightforward and rough, but sophisticated beauty.\n\nYeji is a high-quality handmade 1/1 art collection\nmade in size 2,940 x 4,639.\n\nPublished in 2022 by L D H ®",
