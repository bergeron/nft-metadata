    "description": "About Humanity Bereft:\n\nWhat is past is prologue, we are told. But what has humanity learned from the countless times we have taken the wrong path? The War to End All Wars left countless lives lost or broken, and families shattered for the few decades it took for the next war to begin. Itâ€™s enough to make an angel weep. Dedicated to the memory of Private William Eldridge, Royal Fusiliers No. 11142, and all those like him.\n\n\n",
