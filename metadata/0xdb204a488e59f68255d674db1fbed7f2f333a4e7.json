    "description": "For centuries women, muses and models were  \nfacing gentlemen painters, photographers and  \nfilmmakers ... they have contributed to and  \nelevated art, repeatedly and silently co-creating  \nwith their male counterparts .. today, albeit rather  \ntoo slowly in my opinion, women artists are making  \ntheir voices heard and visions seen ... I firmly  \nbelieve they will enrich the history of art for the  \ncenturies to come .â€¦.. technology, as a fairly new  \nmedium, is one of our keys to change ... art knows  \nno boundaries, no limitations ... control is just an  \nillusion, so let us all watch the future of art unfold :)",
