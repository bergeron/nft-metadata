    "description": "A few years ago, a spacecraft made a hard and forced landing on our world. Unfortunately, the spaceship was damaged and our character \"DROOTH\" would never be able to return to his home planet without repairing the spacecraft. Meet the fun, funny, and cute versions of DROOTH, who loves our world and tries to adapt to our world over time!\nWe had a lot of fun while preparing this 3,000 PFP collection. We hope you have a lot of fun, embrace and love DROOTH :)",
