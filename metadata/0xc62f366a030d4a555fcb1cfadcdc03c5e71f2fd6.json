    "description": "London 2022.\n\nArchitecture defines our environment and our lives. \n\nWell-designed cities add richness to our everyday and have the opportunity to surprise, excite and reward us. Museums, concert halls and transport infrastructure engage in large numbers f people and we all like to feel treated as individuals.\n\nCities are places of motion and buildings are central to the ebb and flow of their populations on a daily, weekly and annual basis. I see buildings as places of motion, overviewing the passing of time without comment but with a positive engagement.\n\n5669 x 3780 px\n\nDate of creation 2022.\nNot for commercial use.\n",
