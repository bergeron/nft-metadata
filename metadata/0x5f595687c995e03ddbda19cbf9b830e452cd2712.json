    "description": "1/1 minted by Athena Novo, New York Polaroids, 2022\n\nAn Alternative New York during the NFT Summit and beyond.. Minted on my own New York Polaroids smart contract deployed on Manifold.\n\nWhile everyone was enjoying the NFT Summit, a different group of visitors were in New York. Some call them demons, monsters and zombies while I would prefer more neutral terms but nonetheless here are some of the photographs I've taken of them which I release with full disclosure and their cooperation. The prospective collectors should acknowledge the existence of \"undead\" and some even more exotic characters might cause some alarm among the general population. Therefore viewer caution is warranted even though most of these peoples I met during the NFT Summit seemed to be of absolutely good character (not sure about some demonic entities that did not respond) and interested in art and its manifestation with the technologies branded aptly as NFT and what not.",
