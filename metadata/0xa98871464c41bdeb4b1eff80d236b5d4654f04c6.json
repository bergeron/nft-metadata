We are like a prisoner.\n\nThis project wants to show the human emotions that are suppressed within through fashion photography.\n\nWhen sometimes, we are unable to release our own emotions to the people around us to know. \n\nIt is like a prisoner who is imprisoned without freedom.\n\nOriginal photography: Chairit Prapai\nPhoto manipulation: No Faith / Federico Salvador",
