    "description": "She thought she was going the right way (whatever that looked like) but as she fled one frightening scene, she was plunged into another without warning.\n\nFalsehood and denial fuelled this landscape; the only way she could see herself escaping, was by following the sun...\n\n*This piece is an original painting, created by myself using: ink, watercolour, acrylic ink and fine liner. If requested, the original can be dispatched to the buyer.",
