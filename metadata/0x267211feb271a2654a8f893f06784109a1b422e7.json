    "description": "Over and over, I am drawn to the downtrodden of inhabitants of like Night City depicted in works like William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy. Each time I visit the dystopian cyberpunk world I want to see more. So... I have embarked on creating my rendition of these forgotten people. My Dead-End Punks will be populated with the \"underclass\" of a bleak future that has forgotten them.  Urchins, pimps & prostitutes, the homeless, shopkeepers and street racers etc., etc... will all be represented. Though marginalized, my characters shall all be imbued with strength, grit, tenacity, and style.",
