    "description": "Architectural photography is used here as a method to decompose the formal relationship between the infrastructures of a city and that of a pixel, through the deconstruction of architectural images and their overdigitalization. It attempts to imagine a “molecular architecture” at an image’s end, beyond the pixel. These compositions try to free themselves from any photographic truth. They are intended to question the photographic medium and the realism of urban systems and digital subsystems. ",
