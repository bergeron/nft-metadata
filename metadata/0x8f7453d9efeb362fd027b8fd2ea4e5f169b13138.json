    "description": "This is the first diss record on the blockchain.\n\nFunds from this NFT will go towards paying for plane tickets to go to NYC and filming a music video in his city.\n\nContext:  \nThis man responded to a tweet in which I tagged some artists that I was supporting, someone responded and tagged him as well. Instead of humbling accepting the love he replied with the following.\n\n\"When I drop this track we taking over Web3 slowly but surely. Really not a better rapper on web3 at all\" - Swank Davis\n\nI responded...  \n\"Best thing about Web3 is that itâ€™s a space of abundance & constant development, it canâ€™t be taken over but we can all win in our own way\"\n\nHis reply...  \n\"Bro you not taking over no where with that drop ðŸ¤£ you minding mine instead of tryna prove a dumb ass opinion itâ€™s mad projects but itâ€™s few blue. This blue chip music my g run along.\"\n\nMy response...  \n\"This response made little sense. Iâ€™m minding mines, not yoursâ€¦but you did literally comment in reply so I couldnâ€™t help but get the notification. Good luck with that sense of entitlement, hope it works out for you.\"\n\nHe responds again...  \n\"Bro I ainâ€™t even doin no bac and forth on no internet let alone giving you energy when you literally jumped into our convo nd just said whatever we takin shit over AOP shÃ¬t your music needs work gang and you thought it was a we thing so you added your two cents not the same tier And in real life too not just on the internet.\"\n\nI end by saying...  \n\"Okay tough guy\"\n\nBut I'm petty so here we are.",
