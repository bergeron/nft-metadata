    "description": "**Anchor + UST – [Wrapped aUST](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8De3e3c934e2A1BB08B010104CcaBBD4D6293ab)**\\\nAnchor is a traditional money market and cross chain yield farming protocol built on the Terra ecosystem. Because it takes deposits in [US Terra (UST)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd), an algorithmic stablecoin that could potentially lose its peg during periods of market instability, this pool combines the standard protection on yield farms and money markets with UST peg protection. This is necessary because Anchor can be working as intended and paying out the expected amount of UST while the price of UST falls below $1. This pool offers protection not only on the risk associated with Anchor but also on the risk of UST losing it’s peg.",
