    "description": "The war that began on February 24, 2022 in my country prompted me to create this collection. I want to show those emotions that change every day in my soul and the souls of my people. Pain, fear, horror mixed with hope and faith in tomorrow.\nThese bunch of emotions are difficult to describe in words, but I hope you can see them thanks to my art.\n\nTake care of yourself and your loved ones!\nLove always!",
