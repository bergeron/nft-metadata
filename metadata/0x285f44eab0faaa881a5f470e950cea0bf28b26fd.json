    "description": "Tiny Heads in Little Boxes is my first ever A.I (Artificial Intelligence) piece.\nA study on the creative process using a variety of techniques ... for this artwork i fed an expressionistic drawing into the AI (DALL-E) then made a collage with the results of the AI's interpretation of my initial sketch. Once the collage was made i proceeded to add more expressionism to the piece until i felt it was ready to be animated with floating looom particles...\n\nOverall the piece feels like music's energy and emotional dynamics...being triggered by memories inside our minds , fleeting thoughts and feelings while listening to the rhythm and melody.....\n\n",
