    "description": "From the inside out, we are energy: embodying will and determination, calm and entropy; we are both light and darkness.\n\nEnergy is present in all things in existence, in what we can perceive and what we cannot.\n\nEnergy is a wave of possibilities, collapsing into reality before our very own eyes.\n\nWe are here, in this plane of existence, to experience, absorb, and return the energy that the universe has lent to us. We are here to understand and respect all forms of it.\n\nWe are here to love, laugh, and live through it all, because we are, fundamentally, all energy.",
