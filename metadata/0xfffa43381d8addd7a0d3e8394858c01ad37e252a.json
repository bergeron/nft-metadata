    "description": "Underneath an old bridge from the colonial era I was documenting, I see children laughing and playing in the water.\nThey see my camera and point at it in curiosity, whispering words of excitement to each other in Hausa.\n“This is a camera”, I said with a smile. “It freezes you in time”.\nI took a picture of the most petite boy, to explain how the camera works. His eyes light up!\n“Mutuminna”, he says. He gestures for me to wait and runs to call his brother to experience what he just saw.\nThey took turns diving into the river and after, I arrived at this image \n\nNB: Mutuminna means \"My Man\" ",
