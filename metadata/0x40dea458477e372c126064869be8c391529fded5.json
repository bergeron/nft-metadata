    "description": "e9Art - AI Portraits (the weird & the wonderful)\n\n\nin the rapidly changing world of AI, i already find myself waxing nostalgic about the earlier, less perfect, versions of AI art tools. \n\ni love their unpredictable interpretations and flawed renderings, especially of the human form…\n\nand i wanted to document that on the blockchain … to record this fleeting, ephemeral moment of these (beautiful?) imperfections …\n\nof the AI art tools … and perhaps also, of my own.\n\ndigital art by e9Art using disco diffusion 5.6,  photoshop, et al. August 2022.",
