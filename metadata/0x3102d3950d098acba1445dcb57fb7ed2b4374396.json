    "description": "An absence of a victor is only evidence of sacrifice. We all sacrifice parts of ourself to achieve the impossible. Sacrifice has a habit of leaving an everlasting imprint. In a way, it can make you immortal. \n\nThis whole piece revolves around a seemingly innocent chessboard. However, its placement is not coincidental. The pieces are setup equal to the end of the renowned “Immortal Game”. Arguably the most famous chess-game in history. Adolf Anderssen won the match by sacrificing 6 vital pieces, ending the game with a surprising checkmate.\n\nThere is a saying about sacrifice that goes “What you let go of determines how high you fly”. The feathers displayed before the chessboard is a symbol of Anderssen’s ascension after his bold win. The man laying on the bench is Kieseritzky, who in consequence has “lost face”, as a result of his defeat.\n",
