    "description": "The digital enhancement of a small acrylic painting (8” x 8”). In this series, which is more intellectual than emotional, I strive to find a new way of envisioning the human figure in what is really abstract painting. A coldhearted portrait bust, austere in its representation of the human being as a set of planes with no distinction between figure and ground, the only personality depicted that of the artist. \n\n• (5000 x 5000 pixels, JPG)",
