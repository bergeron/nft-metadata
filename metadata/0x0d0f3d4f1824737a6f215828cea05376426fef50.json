    "description": "'Looking for Satoshi' is a project that sprouts from the layers and states I've painted on one wooden panel. From 2016 until 2020 I painted several portraits and minted a few of them on SuperRare. \n\nThis project blends a bit of our meme culture and taps into the ancient craft of painting at the same time. It refers to our current financial state and brings an ode to artists I admire. \n\nWhen this blueprint is sold out, I will determine a date on which I will give away 'My two Satoshi's' : \nhttps://superrare.com/artwork-v2/'my-2-satoshis'-18110 + this particular panel to one lucky collector. \n\nI will use 'Wheel of Names' to pick a winner. \n\nTo qualify for this draft, a collector needs to :\n\n1: follow me on Twitter\n2: add the address that holds the blueprint to a dedicated tweet that will be send into the world when the time is right. \n\n\nThis blueprint also contains 3 legendaries which are part of the 'Bitcoin White Paper' series. This series will have 13 pieces that will be minted during 2023, more info can be found on the website.\n\nThank you for following me on this journey. \n\nMay the SATS be with you!",
