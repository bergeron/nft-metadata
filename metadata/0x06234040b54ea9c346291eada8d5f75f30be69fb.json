    "description": "The word «бавовна» (cotton, pronounced [bɐvoؑnɐ]) dates back to the 2010s. It was then that the Kremlin instructed the Russian media to officially refer to any explosions as «хлопками» (bangs, pronounced [xlɐˈpkɐmi]). In the event of a violation, a considerable fine awaited the journalists. During the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, explosions and fires occurred on the territory of Russia and in the occupied territories. Propagandists began to talk about «хлопки» (bangs, pronounced [xlɐˈpki]) out of old habits. Someone from the Ukrainians decided to make a fuss and took advantage of the homonymy of the words «хлопОк» (bang, pronounced [xlɐˈpok]) and «хлОпок» (cotton, pronounced [ˈxlopək]) (a plant popular in the textile industry) and translated it into Ukrainian as «бавовна» (cotton). Now this word means the result of hitting the enemy’s military equipment with high-precision weapons, destroying ammunition warehouses and military headquarters in the war with the Russian invaders.",
