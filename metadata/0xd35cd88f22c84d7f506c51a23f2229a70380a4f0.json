    "description": "The enemy comes to our land. He burns our homes, destroys our infrastructure, eradicates and cripples the most defenceless of our nation. Women and children, old and young - they suffer most because of the dictator's evil will and shattered mind. \n\nBut we fight and we will prevail. Our nation stands strong and defends every inch of our land - with guns, honor and blood. This is not only our fight - it's the final battle for Europe and all civilized world against Horde and tyranny's madness.\n\nAND WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT! All funds from these transactions will be spent for humanitarian aid for homeless children from Mariupol, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Our cities-heroes paid a high price for our freedom - and some of them are still paying.\n\nPlease, help us in this last battle against tyranny and cruelty. Together we can do it!",
