    "description": "When I captured this photo I instantly got hit with a feeling of nostalgia for all those old 50â€™s films like Strangers on a Train and North by Northwest; A time when traveling by train was a great luxury.\n\nPictured here is the Rocky Mountaineer train, it was designed to be a sightseeing vehicle that would service between Vancouver, Calgary and Jasper. Later on they added Colorado to Utah as a route, making it a classic way to travel the west.",
