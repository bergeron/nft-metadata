    "description": "This artwork is part of a daily Aughostus themed drawing prompt during the month of August which I host annually. The prompt was \"Heart\". This is the backstory I wrote for the piece:\n\n“This note was found in a First Aid book from the 1940’s… at least a hundred years after Aughostus died. What a coincidence that it was also found near what would’ve been his living quarters long ago! Is he still here? Can ghosts draw?\"  \n \n\nThis was drawn with ink and paint marker on a vintage First Aid text book page from 1940.\n\n1436 px x 2368 px at 300 dpi",
