    "description": "The human mind assimilates symmetry with beauty. The more symmetrical a face, the more beautiful it is considered to be. Plastic surgery, botox, fillers, creams, implants chase this seemingly elusive trait. Beauty standards have ruined the celebration of the natural.\n\nIn this depiction even in a setting that is seemingly perfect, beautiful, vibrant. Symmetrical. \n\nIf you look hard enough, there will be imperfections within. Why hide them? Why shy away from them? The world chases rarity, values the uncommon. Why not apply this to ourselves? \n\nThat’s what makes us unique. That’s what makes us stand out. That’s what makes us special. \n\nCelebrate it!\n\nArt : 1/1",
