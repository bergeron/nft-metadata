    "description": "There was a girl in a certain place. She was bored every day and lived an ordinary life with no dreams. She tried to do something but gave up as soon as she encountered something painful or hard. She was a little weak-minded.\n\n　One day, she met a mysterious animal.  Name is Piko. It was there to support me through hard times and happy times, and I loved it. I fell in love with Piko-chan. As the days went by, the girl became more and more spoiled by Piko-chan. She told me that she would teach me anything, help me when I was in trouble, and be there for me when I was alone. She would give me something even if I did not do anything. She became spoiled.\n\n　To be honest, I think all human beings are like that. We have expectations of others, and I think it is difficult to keep a strong heart that can endure in hard times. It is also difficult to keep trying. But that doesn't make me an ordinary person. I don't want to be an ordinary person. I have made up my mind that I want to be a person who can say out loud that I am special and live with pride. It is not others who can change me, but myself.\n\nWhy don't you join me and take a step by step?\n",
