    "description": "'PRESERVE' is a Transcendental space art of a fantasy planet from a dune. It is the first artwork in the series of my \"Space Dunes\" creations and also my first artwork to cross 10k likes on Instagram. The title of this artwork 'PRESERVE' means to maintain (something) in its original or existing state, in this case to maintain the existence of this breathtaking place away from human interference. The small space explorer on the dune and the large planet on the horizon brings in the sense of scale and hence provides the viewer with a wonderful visual!\n\n\nMEDIUM: Digital 2d Art || YEAR: 2022 || DIMENSIONS: 2200*2750px (base x height) || DEPTH: 600ppi (8-bit) || COLOR SCHEME: sRGB\n\nProject Details:\n[https://www.artstation.com/artwork/WmGr9y]\n\nInstagram Link:\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/CZW_remJpQ6]",
