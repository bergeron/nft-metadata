    "description": "Biggie Smalls, commonly known as \"The Notorious B.I.G.,\" was a well-known hip-hop artist and the face of gangsta rap on the East Coast. Since I was eleven years old, I've been listening to rap/hip-hop music. Biggie songs still make me bop my head whenever I hear them. My art is highly influenced by classic hip-hop artists such as The Notorious B.I.G.\n\n---\n3000 x 3000px\npng\n",
