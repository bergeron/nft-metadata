    "description": "This is a 1/1 NFT minted of a 1/1 Wet Plate Collodion Tintype created with a similar process to how they were created in the 1860s.  This unique process creates an image on aluminum using photo sensitive chemicals.  It yields an image that will last as long as the metal itself at a quality that is unmatched compared to most other analogue photographic processes.\n\nThis particular image is from a series called Lying Among Flowers.  It is a series based around Love, Death, and Sex and the thin vail that separates those ideologies.  ",
