    "description": "Waking to a morning covered in moist foggy air, the tree's of the Karri forest wait for the warmth of the sun to filter through the forest at the start of the day. \n\nA drive along Scotsdale Tourist Drive near Denmark on Western Australia's South Coast is a feast for the eyes, and a delight for the soul. This, but one of many stunning scenes along the 34km route.\n\nThe beautiful colour palette and painterly appearance is enhanced by the cold, still, moist air and makes for a photographer or painters dream.",
