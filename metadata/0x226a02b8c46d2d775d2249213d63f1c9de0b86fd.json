    "description": "Colourful Compassion\n\nA rhetoric, isn't it beautiful to find ourselves enjoying solitude?\nA moment passing right in front of our eyes and soul,\nOur heart trying to catch the fluttering invisible butterfly\nthat is meant to find itself home back in you~\n\nThere's peace and prosperity in perspectives,\nWhen clarity strikes our beautiful minds\nand each feather leaving our palms like eyes and saline,\nan ephemeral experience turning into ethereal epiphany ~\n\nThat's what life is all about,\nspur of the moment redefined...\n\nColour Compassion is a confluence of our two worlds, with Ashwini creating a picture with his words and Hetansh speaking through his photos.\n\nEdition: 1/1 \n\nDetails of Photo:\n\nLocation: Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India\nTime: Sunrise \nYear Created: 2021 \nGears: Phone",
