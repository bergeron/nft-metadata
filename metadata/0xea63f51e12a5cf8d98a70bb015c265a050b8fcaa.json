    "description": "I've always been fascinated with the beauty of flowers.   \n\nIn late 2001 I picked up a procedural \"organic modeler\" called \"Xfrog\" that allowed you to model geometry with nodes much like Houdini.   After a few crazy abstracts I attempted to create something \"real\" with it in early 2002.   \n\nOf course I didn't want it to look too real.   I wanted something that was both \"cybernetic\" and also natural.   I'd studied the Fibonacci sequence a few years previous and wanted to incorporate the Golden Ratio that so often occurs in nature.\n\nI created three different different color variations my daisy model in Lightwave3D.   The blue, or \"Cobalt\", version is the one I featured in my gallery.   \n\nThe \"Fire\" and \"Emerald\" versions were also popular but have only been available in my \"Pickle Jar\" alternate gallery since 2002.\n\nI returned to the project in 2012 for my \"Sunburst\" and \"Inverse\" versions.   \n\nI should probably add a new version in 2022...",
