    "description": "The Strange Parade has been an ongoing motif in my work for many years, and it marches through all the various imaginary spaces that haunt my whirling brain. Every Parade I draw is a smaller segment of the whole, a continuity of strange creatures and Dreamers that winds it’s way through all my art. I’m very excited to bring this segment, entitled ‘Strange Parade 7543’ to the digital realm as my Genesis Piece on Foundation. \n4725 x 3544px\n(Larger file available for printing IRL)",
