    "description": "I took this photo in Keflav√≠k, Iceland while out for a walk on the last morning of my 3-month solo trip. \n\nLike the photographed rock statue, I found myself gazing out to sea; sometimes lovingly, sometimes longingly, sometimes something else entirely. \n\nThis collection is a reflection of those mixed feelings one experiences with the conclusion of a profound, life-defining experience.
