    "description": "LNRZ SZN 2 WK 2\n\nEldar Zey has produced with artists like Daniel Allan, DLG., Deegan, Reo Cragun, Pluko, and many more, but has never released under his own name.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAmber is a sonic exploration and a true feat of sound design & imagination. The first of many Eldar Zey releases.\n\nA quote from LNRZ team member DLG. :\n\n\"Eldar is a mad scientist of music and it makes me so happy he's releasing his own songs finally that I might cry\"\n\nJoin LNRZ HQ here: https://guild.xyz/lnrz-hq",
