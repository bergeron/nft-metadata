    "description": "If you close your eyes.. you can hear the desperate moan of those, who were beaten, raped and tortured to death in Bucha, Irpin and Gostomel. And those, who are still alive, whose hearts are drowning in bitter sorrow..\n\nWe can’t change the past. We can’t prevent this tragedy. All we can do is gently take their warmless hands and make them free again. We can cut off the ropes on the unarmed hands of ordinary civilians who have become martyrs by the Russian army. With all tenderness to our breathless brothers and sisters we can take them from the cold streets of Ukrainian cities and give them dissent place for eternal sleep.\n\nP.S. By purchasing this nft you are supporting Ukrainian artist. Part of the received funds will be directed to support the Ukrainian army and people affected by the war in Ukraine. \n",
