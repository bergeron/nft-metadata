    "description": "In Search of Stillness: Journey Through the Pacific Northwest\n\nEdition 1/1\n\nArtist: Shaun Stewart\n\nAn incredible road trip through Oregon and Washington culminated with a final stop in Mt Rainier National Park. It was midsummer and the peak of wildflower season was coming to a close. After a spectacular day of hiking in the park, we arrived at Tipsoo Lake for sunset.\n\nWe watched the color set ablaze the hazy August sky from a splendid vista overlooking the lake and distant Rainier.",
