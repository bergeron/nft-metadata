    "description": "September 14th, 2019: Russian Hill, San Francisco, CA\n\nAfter living and working in NYC for almost 6 years, my (now) fianc√© & I decided to move out to San Francisco for a can't pass up job opportunity for her. It would be a last hurrah of sorts for us; living in one more city before settling back home near family in Massachusetts.\n\nLooking back on this photo, it was in the first month of me moving there. An awesome night with new friends, laughing and having drinks on their rooftop with this gorgeous view as our back drop.\n\nOnly a few months later, the pandemic hit and the next couple years were not what we envisioned when moving there. We are super fortunate and grateful to have not been significantly affected by COVID like others sadly were. Selfishly, we still felt a little robbed (or rushed) of our SF experience with the city locked down for most of our almost 3 years there.\n\nReminiscing... this was one of those great nights, before shit hit the fan and I'm thankful we had it.",
