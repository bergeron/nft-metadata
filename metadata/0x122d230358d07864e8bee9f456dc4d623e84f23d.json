    "description": "The tragedy of 9/11 is one of the most significant world events of the 21st century with millions of people visiting ground zero every year to pay their respects to those who lost their lives. The Empty Sky memorial is a monument to all those from New Jersey who gave their lives on that fateful day. The two pillars inscribed with the names of the deceased line up perfectly with the location of where the twin towers previously stood. The lone woman paying her respects, the United States flag, and the newly erected One World Trade encircled within the glow of the early morning sun have been used to highlight the importance of the past whilst giving hope to a brighter future.\n\nOver a period of three years, I was commissioned to work on a book that really got under the skin of New York. I spent many months exploring the city and telling the stories of the people and places that make New York such an enthralling and captivating city. The body of work I produced was vast but from all the thousands of images I shot this was by far the most profound.  Even being quoted as being “one of the most culturally relevant photos of our time”.\n\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
