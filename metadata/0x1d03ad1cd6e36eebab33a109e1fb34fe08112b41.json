    "description": "This NFT represents the Original Canvas Painting I did in 05/2022.\n\n100x60 cm (39x24 inch)\nOil on canvas\n2022\n\nGiraffes sit high, looking far away. Faberge eggs symbolize prosperity and wealth. Plus, judging by the content of one of them, fertility. TurtleHorn, an unprecedented creature, the most protected and impregnable. Lizards at a low start are vigilant, guarding the sleep of an unborn person. The landscape is serene and deserted. Everywhere is silence and tranquility. The baby is sleeping.",
