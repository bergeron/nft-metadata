    "description": "This rat is the happiest of his life. Represented through a rough sketch and colours, it shows the little rodent accumulating more and more cheese into his shopping kart, with the biggest smile on his little rat face.\nType. Digital Artwork (.JPEG)\n\n**by [@Murmure](https://twitter.com/MurmureArt) aka RatVinci**\nMurmure is a youthful and fierce Rat, drawing and painting whenever they can. French, born and bred, the true love of cheese flows through their veins (even tho they are lactose intolerant). Still new to NTF and Cryptos in general, they hope to share their love of Art and Art History to everyone who might be interested\n\n**Nine rats** is an 1/1 art auction organised by the artists of the Flooded District, at Rat Kingdom.",
