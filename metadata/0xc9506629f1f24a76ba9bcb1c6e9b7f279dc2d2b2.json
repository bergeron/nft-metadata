    "description": "I remember the first time my mother told me the story of the toothy mouse. The first Christmas waiting for Santa Claus. These types of illusions are lost with age but I continued to preserve the illusion of being a great artist with that same illusion and love that my brothers await at dawn to run to see the gifts under the pine tree. They say that maturing is gradually giving up dreams. I don't want to grow up, I want to keep dreaming forever.",
