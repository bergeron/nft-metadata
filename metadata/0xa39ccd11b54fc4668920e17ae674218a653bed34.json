    "description": "1/1 in Bryce Glenn's debut collection\n \"With Love,\"\n\nThis collection was inspired by both the sense of wonder & uncertainty that this life presents. It's a figurative love letter to anybody who feels overwhelmed by the unknown, and finds themselves in the search for something bigger than themselves. I hope you feel less alone on that journey, and can learn to see all the beauty around you in the midst of that. \n\nShot entirely on 35mm film, in Malibu California.",
