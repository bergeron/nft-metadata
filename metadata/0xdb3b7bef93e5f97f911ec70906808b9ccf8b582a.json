    "description": "The mysterious moving object, Oong, effectively embodies the overall structure and mission statement of HanDAO. Han(한) bears its namesake and symbol from the Korean character 'ㅎ (hieut)'. It derives its origins from the character, 'Han', representing the collective unity and spirit of the Korean people. Dot: A seed of creation; micro-universe; the beginning and the end of the universe. Horizontal line: Territories; land; boundaries. Orb: White hole; expansive cosmos; human groups; the natural world. \n HanDAO exists to restore the creativity of the human spirit and empower human dignity. HanDAO creates a coordination system for radical collaboration and three-dimensional synergy as an empowered DAO organization with a foundation in freedom and solidarity. HanDAO discovers and supports the impactful creators of our times, shapes narratives, and contributes to the world-building of digital spaces where a diversity of values thrive (metaverse/NFT ecosystem).",
