    "description": "The photo that started it all for me. \n\nAfter buying the sigma 35mm lens I took this shot and immediately fell in love with it. As the taxi was turning clicked the shutter and it was forever stuck in that fraction of a second jittering back and forth as it was making the turn. It's not that I hadn't tried long exposures before but this one got me excited about them. I love Japanese taxis and this photo while being blurred, shows the essence of the exterior on the typical taxi in Tokyo. The colors trail across the shot and remind me of paint strokes on a canvas. This right away became one of my favorite shots and I have since tried to build off of this shot to create more and more unique pieces like it. ",
