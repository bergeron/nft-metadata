    "name": "Memphis Recording Service Neon Sign",
    "description": "Former radio engineer Sam Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service at 706 Union Avenue in 1950. Having delivered a couple of rhythm-and-blues number ones, Phillips set up his own label, Sun Records.\n\nThe following year Phillips recorded singer, Elvis Presley, whose five singles for Sun are among the most notable pop records of the 20th century. Sun became a magnet for talented young artists throughout the South, including Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, all of whom Phillips recorded with patience, humor, and considerable inventiveness. \n\nHis simple but ingenious use of echo helped to define the new sound of rock and roll.",
