    "description": "Dust continually takes something. Time immediately stands still and the hot breath of the Sun pales away. The dust is a salt land for the city. The city, an abandoned oasis on earth; the weed rises from the grave and scuffs the height of the sky. Out number falls, lesser than before, but nothing changes. Your shadow loses its color and stretches through the water. You look at it and the moment stops.",
