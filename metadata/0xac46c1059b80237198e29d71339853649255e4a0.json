    "description": "\"1-800-CZ depicts a mysterious character, CZ, surrounded by imagery and symbols that evoke a new media sensibility. More specifically, CZ is intended to represent a witty, borderline heroic Talk Show host, who has a sort of dual personality. Hero or anti-hero? Altruist or Opportunist? \n\nWhat does he mean? What does he want? His motives? Under the thin veneer of a respectable and honest businessman, the crypto and web3 adjacent audiences are left with these questions. So, when you're ready, call CZ at 1-800-CZ. Maybe you'll find your answers, but more than likely you will end up with even more questions.\"",
