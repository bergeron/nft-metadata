    "description": "To those who do not fear the haunting, it brings disaster.  \nIt brings prosperity to those who worship the Spirit.\n\nTaira no Masakado once rebelled against the imperial court after a power struggle.\n\nHe fought against the Imperial Court to bring peace to the Kanto region, the eastern part of Japan, but was defeated when his aspirations were not realized.\n\nHe was decapitated and carried to Kyoto with only his head for all to see.\n\nHowever, his head did not rot even after three months; on the contrary, it shook the people of Kyoto with its nightly cries.\n\nThen one day, the head alone soared into the sky and flew away again to the Kanto region.\n\nHe then became a possessed god and began to bring various disasters to the people.\n\nFearful people sealed the calamity by building a shrine at the place where his head is said to have fallen and enshrined him as a god.\n\nMore than 1,000 years after his death, the shrine still stands and continues to bring misfortune to those who disrespect the shrine.",
