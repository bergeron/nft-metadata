We are longing for perfection but as we reflect on ourselves we are stuck in the present and the past.  \nWith self doubt. it may be dark and full of struggle now, but know that our future can always be brighter. \n\nWith entries from over 400 incredible artists, my work was selected as number 1 by 6 judges.  \nThe whole experience was a movement. Rik setup something beautiful and this can never be taken away.  \nTo have this piece minted on the blockchain, feels like a start of something new. A brighter future.",
