    "description": "**WHAT IS THE \"DIGITAL HAIKU\" SERIES ALL ABOUT?**   \nWhat can be created with just the graphic tools available on a smartphone? I posed this question to myself in 2013 and have been experimenting ever since. I called the series working name \"Digital Haiku\" and it has stayed that way. The tools available on phones have evolved a lot since then - where will this lead?\n\n**THE COLLECTION**   \nThis collection is part of the \"Digital Haiku\" series.\n\n[Description](https://medium.com/@st0cha5t1c-art/does-kitsch-exist-eddaa5ff4b98).\n\nTechnical Notes: All graphics in this collection were made with the AI text-to-image on a smartphone and have the aspect ratio of the its screen. Then they were postproduced with Photoshop and were then combined into an animation using DaVinci Resolve.\n\nThe collection was created from February 4, 2023.\n\n**ARTWORK**   \nFull name: The Milkmaid By Johannes Vermeer Milled By Kitschy Art Machine 78C.02",
