    "name": "The Adventurer and The Saint",
    "description": "Pilgrimage is based on the idea that travel transforms. One who truly travels may start out as a saint with an uncomplicated history, but the encounters on the journey may complicate their ideas of self-perfection and purity and if they have enough thrilling encounters, such a person might cultivate an appetite for travel and become an adventurer. Conversely one might begin as an adventurer, eager to explore and encounter people and situations that expand their capacity for empathy and refine them into saints. One often overlooked definition of pilgrimage is ‘the course of life on earth’. We are changed when we travel, there is always another self or selves refracted by our encounters on our journeys, waiting for us on the other side",
