    "description": "Underwater world\n\nGraceful fish, remarkable seashells, weird shapes and the blurred distinction between plants and animals inspired the NFT series by Myrtha Steiner.\nDuring 52 dives, which took 2382 minutes all together, the artist was exploring the flora and fauna of the South China Sea with growing fascination. Curious fish, colourful seashells, arcane formations, the disappearance of yellow and red colours while descending â€“ each dive brought new discovery.\n",
