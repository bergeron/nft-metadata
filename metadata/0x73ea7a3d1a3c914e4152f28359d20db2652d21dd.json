All ecstasies of life and rhapsodies of delight have been mine because of her. And here, at the end, I can say that I have known no sweeter, deeper madness of being than to drown in the fragrant glory and forgetfulness of her hair. ❞\n\nUnique artwork by Guillain Méjane (2019)\n\n\n\n[More info on the project](https://www.vagabond-des-etoiles.com/arts/photographie/voyageur-des-etoiles-guillain-mejane/)",
