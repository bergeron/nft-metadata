    "description": "“Even the light of day\nIsn't like the light that lights your way\nI like the way you look, I do\nBut I love the way u look at the world \n3rd eye looking out and you took it in\nYou got your outlook from looking in”\n\nImagine a Yogi meditating in the bush, caught up in ecstatic meditation. So highly enamored by chanting a mantra over and over again that when a passerby tries to get the Yogi’s attention, the Yogi just continues chanting.\n\nOne may feel disrespected or as we say in Jamaica you would feel like the Yogi “styled you”. In Jamaica \"Style\" can mean u have style as in you are unique, you have your own way of doing things. Another meaning is someone “styled u” as in they curved you, ignored you or deceived you etc.\n\nIn this example though, the yogi isn’t “styling” the passerby. It's simply the yogi’s style to chant for extended periods without interruptions. The passerby understands what is happening as well and sees the Yogi means no disrespect. The passerby actually feels welcomed and greeted by the love and bliss that the Yogi radiates.\n\n “I’m so high that when people say Hi, I don't have to say Hi back” \n\nThe aforementioned image of the Yogi inspired these lyrics. The Yogi is so high, or rather so deep, in meditation that they don't need to say Hi. The effect of the meditation says “Hi” for him/her, it speaks for itself, it speaks love, peace, prosperity, forgiveness. Everyone who encounters the Yogi feels the love and doesn't take the Yogi not acknowledging them as an offense. \n\nIn the song when I say “I’m so high that when people say Hi, I don't have to say Hi back” I’m saying, I’m so focused that my full involvement in the creative ‘work’ speaks of how precious my time is and my obsession has nothing to do with ignoring anyone, it’s about following through on the commitments in my life.\n\nIt’s about prioritizing the quality of our focus and the sacrifices that may have to be made to achieve our goals. Let your work ethic speak for itself. Regardless of the distractions that may arise, we must remain unwavering in our efforts. This requires frequent check-ins with our Self, our objectives and how we are investing our time.\n\n‘Meditate’ is a call to think deeply on how we want to contribute to the ecosystem at large. To become fully engaged in actualizing the vision we have for our Self. To commit to the daily work and the healthy habits that our purpose requires. To become clear with the people in our life about the value of our time. To be immersed in doing things that we value, with our time.\n\nEveryone who mints an edition of the Meditate Song NFT on SoundXYZ gets 2 free mints of the Music Video NFT, one of which they are encouraged to list for sale on OpenSea. Only collectors of the Song NFT on SoundXYZ are able to mint the Music Video NFT. \n\nThe song on SoundXYZ has a different arrangement and mix than the song in the music video, which gives both a unique element. \n\n‘Meditate’ is song the with most Patois (Jamaican Slang) i've released in web3.
