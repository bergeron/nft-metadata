    "description": "A non-linear and fragmented narrative, where the events are portrayed out of chronological order and do not follow the direct causality pattern of the events featured.\n\nScenes could keep repeating themselves to emphasize a parallel distinctive plotline, or include dream immersions to mimic the structure and recall of human memory.\n\nExplore the depth of the irrational and subconscious mind and its relationships to its environment.\n",
