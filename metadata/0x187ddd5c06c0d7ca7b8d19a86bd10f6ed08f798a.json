    "description": "The Vessels ASH collection is a limited run of characters from the Vessels universe.\n\nEarth is dead. Used-up and broken.  Humanity is on the brink. Our last remnants are clinging to existence on a dangerous alien world and we have brought our old demons with us to our new home.\n\nWhether cursed by fate, chosen by destiny, or just unlucky enough to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, Betsy is burdened with terrible power and terrible purpose. Humanity needs a hero, and she’s the closest thing they’re going to get.\n\nThe Vessels main collection, graphic novel episodes, ‘VesselsGen0’ and ‘Lost Vessels’ collections exist on the Tezos blockchain.",
