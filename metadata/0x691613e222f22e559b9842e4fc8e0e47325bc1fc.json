    "description": "If you had a shirt made of water, would you hang it up on a sunny day or a rainy one?\n\nThis is the first artwork of the Swimwear series.\n\nI found the idea for this series when reading that it takes nearly 2,700 liters of water to make a T-shirt. \n\nBaffled, I started to imagine what clothing would look like if this water usage was more obvious. This naturally led me to fantasize about an impossibility: what if you could wear clothing out of water?\n\nI began dreaming about the details of this series. After years of thought, 'Wet Laundry' was the first artwork that arose. It features a T-shirt made of water, billowing gently in the wind.",
