    "description": "Inspired by Juneteenth, a holiday in the United States commemorating the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, the artist depicts freedom from the shackles of the mind like clockwork being undone, letting go of dark,\nbinding thoughts and finding your ‘wings’ or your ‘flight’ to a better space.\n\nHere's to breaking out of shackles - emotional and physical, that hold us from our true human potential. May we find freedom from within.\n\n",
