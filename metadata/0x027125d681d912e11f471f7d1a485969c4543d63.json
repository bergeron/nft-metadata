    "description": "My favorite thing in my childhood was to spend time alone with my toys. Sometimes I would put on my cowboy hat and run after bandits on my horse made from a tree branch. Sometimes, I used to toss my toy cars around on my racetrack that I made out of books. They were good days. But now it's all gone. I've grown up and my toys don't need me anymore. They need someone who can spend time with them. Just like me. Yes, I took them out of their boxes again today to say goodbye to them. Each of them has a different memory for me. But it was completely different for me. My father gave it to me on my birthday. At that time, this piece was very expensive and I can say that it was the best gift I ever received. Headlights and even gauges were working! How cool was this thing? But now it's time to say goodbye to him. See you mate. \n- H. Riggs (2009)",
