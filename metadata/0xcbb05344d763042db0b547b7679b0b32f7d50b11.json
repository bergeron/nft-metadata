    "description": "秋游山水涧 is my homage to the art of the Song Dynasty using composition from a masterwork. \n\nThis painting used Ping Yuan composition method: clouds and fog to indicate the space relationship of mountains and water. Unlike traditional landscape painting, characters in here also play an important role. It shows the connections of people in the painting, also the connections of the characters and nature.\n\nBackground image: 《跋王献之保姆贴》。   作者：南宋，姜夔。故宫博物院藏。",
