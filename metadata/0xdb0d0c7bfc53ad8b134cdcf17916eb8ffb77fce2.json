    "description": "Ludie Sénatus is an intuitive Haitian-American artist. MetaBloom is a unique collection showcasing the beauty of textures, colors, & technology. Sénatus begins each work as a tangible painting &/or picture then transforms them into digital works of art by digitizing and manipulating the image & using artificial intelligence tech. This cross-process highlights the unexpected wonders of technology but also brings attention to the power of individuality & introspection. Each is a unique conglomeration of bold colors, floral textures, & feminine features, all working together to create a bold, blooming woman.\n\nSenatus’s background in fashion & beauty can be seen throughout this collection, as each figure is dawned in a variety of jewels, headpieces, & lipstick. These vibrant, metallic qualities work in conjunction with the soft bouquets of flowers & ferns, showing that femininity is a spectrum of boldness & beauty.\n\nMetaBloom is an example of the beauty of individuality & feminine unity.",
