    "description": "HeavenlyStar Story # 1 | Stuck (1/2)\n\n(1/1) I'm stuck in a world I made, a place I've always wanted and always had, and it's suddenly so weirdly empty that I'm afraid to go. I was full of passion. It used to be magical, but now it's just boring. I'm confused as to why I was so gifted with magic. A destination I've always desired, a universe I've imagined.\n\n(1/2) Everything I've ever watched or played, from cartoons to video games to movies. It used to be a lot more exciting and enchanted, from what I recall. Which makes me wonder, and I can't figure out why it wasn't as enjoyable as before.",
