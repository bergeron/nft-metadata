    "description": "In early 2022 I had the opportunity to finally visit Patagonia. Beyond the excitement to photograph the mountains and bright fall colours, I was hoping to get a clear night to capture the Milky Way.\n\nOn day 3 of my trek I was finally greeted with a clear night at the Paine Grande camp in Torres del Paine National Park. I patiently waited until the lodge shut off all their lights to capture the brilliance of the Milky Way. Having to wait until 1am, I walked outside my tent to eventually capture what you see before you, a bright Milky Way hanging over my tent.",
