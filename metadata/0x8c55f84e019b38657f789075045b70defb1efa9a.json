    "description": "Travelling is tricky for persons with mobility - limiting disabilities . When they travel , they need to ensure that the places they visit are generally accessible . Normal people may not have to think about ramps or wheelchair - accessible toilets , but these are crucial for people with disability . Virtual reality or augmented reality tour of a destination lets them experience a place and check for accessibility issues . This will help them plan accommodations , places to visit , and routes to take . These technologies also help in planning errands and other journeys . This can reduce a disabled person's anxiety over going out , as they'd know where to find accessible options .",
