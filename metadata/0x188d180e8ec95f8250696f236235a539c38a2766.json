    "description": "Pixel Wolves by Skylar for .JPEG\n\n .JPEG Squared is excited to announce our third collaborative partnership. We decided to work with an up and coming artist out of Los Angeles who goes by Skylar on a collection to represent our fifth season. The collection consists of 150 generative works dubbed \"Pixel Wolves\" with varying rarities and traits and has been created in the artists own style. Each NFT grants the owner access to our discord community and serves as a membership pass until the end of the season at which time the collection will transition from a membership pass to its own standalone collection. Each membership comes with access to our investment community, drop schedules, calls, support, giveaways, monitors and more. Please note that the royalties on all secondary sales go directly to the artist.\n\n.JPEG Season 5 â€¢ 1/27/22-2/28/22",
