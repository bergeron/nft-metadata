    "description": "For those who have been vulnerable enough to let someone so deep in that when they are no longer there, you want to go to sleep with no alarm and hope you wake up in a couple months... this one is for you.\n\n“You will have bad times, but they will always wake you up to the stuff you weren't paying attention to.”\n- Robin Williams as Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting\n\nBeen holding onto this song. I don't think I was ready to share it with the world, or at least the part of the world that's listening. There was a time where I couldn't even play the song for myself. \n\nA funny thing I have said before about being an artist is that it's the only profession where your next partner will know all about your last one. What comes with that is everyone else knowing as well. \n\nMany of you may know me as an extrovert(?) but truly I enjoy keeping to myself and not oversharing outside my close circle. This song was more of a therapy for me so I didn't feel the need to rush it out. I'll start here.\n \nProduced by Boston\nMixed by Mike Seaberg\nArtwork by Jackie Choj\n",
