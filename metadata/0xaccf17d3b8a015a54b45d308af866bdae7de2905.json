    "description": "The first from a series of 101 photo-montages, studying abstract design, learning that actual perfection looks robotic, cold, computer-generated, the more you work on getting it perfect and symmetric, the more it looks like a random background.  \n\nYou purposely create a perfect design and start messing around with it until it becomes interesting to look at.\n\nThe imperfections attract the eye and make your brain question what you're looking at and you can't take your eyes off it, but it's not always in a good way, you can go too far, or the other way, where you don't mess with it enough. \n\nFinding the right balance between imperfection and perfection - that is the key to a design that pleases the eye.
