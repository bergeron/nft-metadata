    "description": "M0N3Y PR1NT3R G0 BRRR0K3 is the 1st ATAB official release, acting as genesis collection. \nMPGB is a clear provocation with the intention of spreading a message.  \nIt aims to make fun of the trend of Open Editions and all the bad actors who have speculated and profited from it, using the concept of the most famous OE as the center of the artwork, combined with the most famous meme, Pepe the Frog, to ridicule the power of big players. \nIn few words: degens p*ss on your money printer.  \nAll trends die, Memes never.",
