    "description": "Following Australiaâ€™s worst bushfires on record we walked the blackened forest, hearts heavy.\nIf decision makers would only walk this path, and see the devastation wrought, perhaps things would be different.\n2C is small numerically, but untreated the effects will be unimaginable. \nThe heightened frequency of bushfires is giving our bush less and less time to recover, changing ecosystems and threatening the survival of various flora and fauna struggling to adapt.\nFor now life prevails, but for how long?\n\nFine art photography by Mountainwalk, published in Marika Magazine, May 2022.\n\n5304x7952",
