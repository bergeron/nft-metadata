    "description": "In Martinique, my native island, is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful jewels of the Caribbean, called the Diamond Rock. It is visible from the coast of the town, Le Diamant, about 2 miles from it. Only a handful of people have the right to reach it on the ground. Over the years, during my many visits to the city, I have been able to contemplate its beauty, but without really approaching it like most people. But one day my girlfriend and I decided to rent a place with a nice view of the rock to celebrate her 30th birthday, and that day the idea came to us to try something new. So, the next day when I woke up, the light was so perfect that I decided to send my drone to visit the rock, risking losing it, because the rock is over 1 mile from me. This photo was taken at over 1600 feet, with very strong winds and gusts. But I assumed that such a shot would require significant sacrifice and risk.\n\nGreg Jean-Jean\n\nIncluded a Print",
