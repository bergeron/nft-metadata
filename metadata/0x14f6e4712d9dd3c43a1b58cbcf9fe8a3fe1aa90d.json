    "description": "As I walked through the crowded observation deck that is Top of the Rock, my eyes fixated on the new skyscraper that is One Vanderbilt. From where I stand, I can see people crowding the observation deck on that building. Flash firing off from iPhones and DSLR, I looked around to see if anyone else was watching the building that now controlled a section of the Island. I was the only one. I took a minute to take in the new building and snapped a few shots. The city is always changing. Taken in April 2022. ",
