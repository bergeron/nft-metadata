    "description": "It's a hot, arid day, and the sun is punishing anyone who stays out in the open for too long. The fine sand blowing in the wind is gradually wearing down clothes and skin exposed to it. The vast desert expands across most of the planet, which is being temporarily inhabited to mine the valuable resources that are trapped beneath the rough surface.\n\nFortunately, Merrick, a patrol guard stationed past the camps, has found a small oasis of life and relief from the harsh environment. The only issue is that he must keep his eyes open for the very creatures that he is protecting the camps from.",
