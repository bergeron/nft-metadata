    "description": "My genesis NFT Magnetism is the first stop motion animation generated entirely by robots ðŸ¦¾ ðŸ“· ðŸŸ¥ \n\nhttps://youtu.be/RQ5lwMIYask\n\nThe ultra rare 4 part series titled Machineimation employs a novel process that took over a year to produce and involves over 100,000+ robotic movements, thousands of photographs and various technologies working together in real time.\n\nThe NFTs were created with stop-motion animation techniques driven entirely by robots without the use of CGI or 3D rendering. Each animation was captured in-camera with still photographs of physical objects manipulated by thousands of robotic movements.\n\nEach piece tells a story not only driven by robots and captured by robots but also including robots as performance artists.\n\nThe series explores a novel relationship where digital and physical worlds collide to produce animated works of digital art from physical objects facilitated by machines.\n\nEach NFT in the series is paired with a signed laser etched transparent acrylic box containing the physical dominos used in the animations with a scannable marker linked to the crypto art.",
