    "description": "**YouTuber Kings**\n\nOwn this stunning 1-of-1 memoir of a bygone YouTube eraâ€” perhaps the most important piece of YouTube history ever: the Original & Uncensored ***YouTuber Kings*** poster bequeathed unto iDubbbz by Sam Hyde on the final day of filming *The Truth About iDubbbz*.\n\nThere is one edition of this artwork in the physical realm, and one in the digital realm. Though the physical print may have already been shredded or burned by its unimpressed recipient, the digital version is ready to stand the test of time in your personal gallery, forever.\n\nWinning bidder may choose from one of two bonus prizes:\n\n1.) ~~All expenses paid 'A Date with Dani' in Providence, RI. Dani will be temporarily weaned off psychotropics and dolled up for a 5-star night on the town. Sam and his documentary crew will be in-tow, filming the elegant and charming date. If it looks like post-date coitus is on the menu, winner will be supplied with spy glasses to use at his discretion (we will be outside with GoPros and selfie sticks trying to find sneak peek angles and also doing on-the-fly director's commentary). Complementary Cialis will be supplied.~~ (nevermind)\n\nOR\n\n2.) A plain white Gildan t-shirt",
