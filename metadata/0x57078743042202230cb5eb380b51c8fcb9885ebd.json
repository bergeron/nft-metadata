    "description": "Often times we choose a path that seems to be the rational one, afraid to take the path that our heart desires. This direction that we choose comes along with difficulties and obstacles so big that they paralyze us and abruptly change the course of our journey. Although at the moment these obstacles are taken as a tragedy, at the end of our journey we understand that they were strategically placed in front of us so we can be true to our hearts.",
