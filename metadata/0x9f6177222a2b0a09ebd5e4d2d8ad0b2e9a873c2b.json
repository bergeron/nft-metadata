    "description": "Art & Poetry collaboration w/ Laurence Fuller & Richard Nadler\n\nThe vast abyss carried away by the waves,\nTouching the forbidden void at the end of days.\nI lost my grip, climbing sandstone caverns,\nI fell head first into an endless lamentation.\nSea lions danced,\nFluctuations of jelly fish in a swarm,\nDeath itself a passenger in the garden of salt.\nLove me the only way that you can,\nA rusted shipwreck of a man,\nWeeds tangled round the splinters of an emotion, \nBut in the deck a pulsating gemstone,\nThat all the sea and all its entities,\nBlossoming anemones, nudibranchs,\nDid gather to see what the sea had sent to me. \nPoetry by Laurence Fuller, 2023\n\nAI & Animation by Laurence Fuller & Richard Nadler\nMusic & Sound by Laurence Fuller\nPoetry & Performance by Laurence Fuller\nwww.laurencefuller.art/web3",
