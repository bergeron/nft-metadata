    "description": "There is no better way to end your 3-day trip to NFT NYC than with a light-hearted and fun after-party, especially when it is an immersive gaming on a cruise! We may have been the first to transform a physical cruise into a virtual world in order to provide an unforgettable event. During the two-hour voyage, players will dive into Metaverse through a teleport and immerse in an open and co-creative Metaverse that Delysium, the world's first AAA blockchain game, is willing to build.\n\nThe event is hosed by Delysium, Aspecta,ai and Mirror World.",
