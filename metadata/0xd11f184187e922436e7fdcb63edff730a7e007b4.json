    "description": "These 1/1 paintings are created using a palette of monochromatic colours, a combination of acrylic paint, pastels, and other mediums. The interplay of light and shadow and the subtleties of tone are important elements of the work, I strive to create dynamic and expressive pieces that capture the variations in textures, experimenting with different techniques and styles from physical to digital striking pieces.\n\nSing The Sorrow Collection  1/1\nTitle: Duet 1\nSize: 40 x 30 cm | 11\" x 15\" (Physical)\nMedium: image (JPG)\nDimensions: 3543 Ã— 4725 px\n",
