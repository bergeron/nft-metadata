    "description": " I wanted to take photos desperately at first but heard it was not possible because photography was not my major. So I recorded the every meaningful scene just with my eyes.\n\n  One day as I was a private, the operation team leader asked who  could shoot better and I raised my hand without hesitation. He said that I didnâ€™t seem to do the work well but he had no choice but to give me a camera because there was no other applicants. His order was to take a picture of the condition of environmental hygiene and I made a cut with all the techniques that I had acquired before. The cut was on the military newspaper the next day and this made me a soldier who could be able to shoot.   \n\n  Some time later I got a leave from the service and then I could see the films developed and this experience was very helpful in that the images that had been in my memory popped up before my eyes and it made me excited.
