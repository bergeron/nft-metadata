    "description": "LVX - Collaboration between Luca Devinu and Victor Scorrano, made in 24 hours on 22 • 02 • 2022.\nBased on one of the \"big questions\" that the Universe enlightens us about:\n\nOn the theory of dimensional relativity, we know that a dragonfly perceives time differently from us humans. To they 20,000 eyes we are slow as a mountain. While we can observe they whole life and that of another 1,080 generations (if life is good with you).\nSo I was wondering, a creature larger than the universe itself, would watch \"the everything\" turning on and off like a firework?\n\n\nHow much is this moment worth?\n\n\n\n\"Music in the background by Polyphony +\"",
