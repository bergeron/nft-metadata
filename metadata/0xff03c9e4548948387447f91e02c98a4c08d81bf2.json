    "description": "On a hot week of summer gifted with a great set of natural lighting this session took place with the usual carefree and spontaneous approach. \n\nThe undeniable chemistry between camera and model was all around the premises, on an at ease state of mind. A singular glance of everyday intimacy unfolded beyond our expectations. \n\nThe Canon AE-1 with the perfect match of the Kodak Portra 400 completed the essential set to register this unique statement on the value of analog photography into the blockchain era.\n\nThis collection of shots represents a great collaboration on the real power of film photography and the assertion of it as an artform.\n\nShot on Canon AE-1 - 35mm Kodak Portra 400 / 2021.",
