    "description": "This piece brings together layers created from paintings I have worked on for decades.  Some of them were worked on during times of struggle and addiction.  \n\nOther digital works that are layered into this work come from times after those struggles, when I have been working hard to right the path of my life.\n\nThe hope is to connect the pain of the past, and the happy work towards the future that now fills my life. I would love to use that connection to make a bridge from viewer, to art, to artist and share those universal human experiences.\n\nAnyone who purchases from this collection will be directly helping me to start my NFT career.  You will truly be my Cosimo(s) and I always work to create opportunities for my original supporters no matter where this web3 ride takes us as we move forward together as artist and patrons.",
