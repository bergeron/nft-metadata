    "description": "SILENTIUM is a poetic artwork that uses symbolism to illustrate how it feels to be in a situation where you are unable to speak or see your own truth. Hence, only seeing and saying what the world wants us to see and say.\n\n\"\ni am lost\nnot in destination but in mind\ni am cold\nnot in the absence of clothing but in heart\n\nthere is an emptiness in my voice\nthere is no direction in my poise\nthere is sound but i hear no noise\nthere is anquish in my own choice \n\nwhere am i\nthere is a hand that leads me\nhow are i\nthere is a hand that mutes me\n\nmy fear is not my own\nmy joy belongs to another\na question of what i am\na silent sheep that follows\n\"\n\nDimensions: 3456 x 5184 px\n\nThe first collector of the artwork will receive two additional NFT's, a poem, and an animated 3D render of SILENTIUM.\n",
