    "description": "This High Priestess Pepedy Gaga card marks the beginning of a new collection â€” the Ultra Rare Pepe Tarot Cards. \n\nThe unique series is a dark fusion of 2D and 3D, hidden Easter eggs, medieval mysticism and Pepe. The collection itself is the apex of 15 years of drawing, animating, experimenting, living, loving and embracing the Teaching of Pepe. Feels good, man.\n\nThe Ultra Rare Pepe Tarot Cards is a modern take on the Tarot, a deck of playing cards that have been used to predict the future since the early 18th century. Each card contains dozens of obscure references and arcane imagery that welcome individual interpretation from the reader. This modified Pepe Tarot deck consists of 88 cards divided into 2 groups: Major Arcana and Minor Arcana.\n\nThe High Priestess before you is a powerful card of the Major Arcana. Guest-starring as the High Priestess II is Pepedy Gaga, a Saint and a Prophet of the end-times with a penchant for loud pop music. \n\nMay the Pepe be with you.",
