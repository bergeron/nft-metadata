    "description": "The Bodega is an animated NFT that parodies a television commercial for a juice-box like kids might see while watching cartoons. The products marketed to lower-income Black communities are often foods and drinks of little nutritional value which merely satisfy hunger and thirst, while upper income communities have a passport to healthy options. This animation flips the script by showing a young Black girl with her third eye open, symbolizing a state of enlightenment achieved through access to proper supermarkets, schools, hospitals, parks, gyms, and the other infrastructure necessary to build healthy communities.\n",
