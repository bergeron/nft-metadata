    "name": "Eagle Keepers #1",
    "description": "In the far reaches of Mongolia, a small group of nomads keeps the tradition of eagle hunting alive. Also known as falconry, this ancient tradition requires skilled handlers to train birds of prey to assist in hunting wild animals. In ancient times, the practice was restricted to the noble classes. There are just around 300 eagle keepers left keeping this thousand-year-old tradition. I stayed with nomad family for a week to understand their traditions and bring these series.",
