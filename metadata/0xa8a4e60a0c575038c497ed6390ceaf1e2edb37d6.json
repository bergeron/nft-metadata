    "description": "The Rosette Nebula, an emission nebula 5,000 light years from Earth. The stars clustered in the center were formed from matter within the nebula.\n\nThe data for this image was collected over 8 nights in January and February 2017 from Samphran, Thailand through an Officina Stellare RH300mm F3.0 telescope using an FLI PL29050 29-megapixel camera cooled to about -30C. Bicolor narrowband data of hydrogen alpha and oxygen 3 were mixed for this RGB image.\n\nhttps://masterdarks.com/rosette-nebula/",
