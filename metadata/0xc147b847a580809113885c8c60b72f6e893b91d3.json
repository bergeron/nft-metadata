There are memories, which we bury and hide from ourselves but which come down to the way we perceive and experience our surroundings. we carry them on our backs like fragmented versions of ourselves whispering in our ears every time we want something or judging each of our actions, these memories prevent us from seeing clearly what is happening in front of us, they prevent us from seeing the present with its original colors our mind constantly compares, they make us feel constant self-rejection, they are all the voices and ideas of others that we have collected over time. I think it's our armor but the armor is very heavy and prevents us from breathing properly, it prevents us from seeing ourselves in the mirror without distorting the image, what are we? Are we all those voices in our mind? I would like to know... which of all those voices is me... Is there anything left of me there?",
