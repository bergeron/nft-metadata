    "description": "“Let's build bridges, not walls.”\n– Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nI like to look at bridges in a metaphorical way and think how important is to create those bridges or connections with other people. Progress and communictation starts when we start to connect with others, when we build our own bridge towards the others.\n\n1/1 edition;\nLandscape photography;\nPortugal;\n4000x2800px",
