Commercial use rights included below.\n\nLyrics:  \n\nFell through the looking glass.  \nFailed to establish contact.  \nThoughts shuffled, tossed about.  \nAnd now I’m never goin’ back.\n\nShadows shifting everywhere.  \nLike a sleep demon, hard-pressed.  \nA shard of mirror in my hands.  \nSlice through the fabric, earn my rest.\n\nIt’s only in your dreams,  \nHalf as real as it seems…  \nIt’s only in your dreams,  \nHalf as real as it seems…  \nNow take the glass again,  \nTake the glass again.  \nYou're fighting for your sleep,  \nYou're fighting for your sleep.\n\nWhite Rabbit, off again.  \nHe knows what his time is worth.  \nLate again, force of habit.  \nRollin' heads and an empty purse.\n\nSoft pelt, swaddles the heart.  \nBears the chill of a broken window.  \nYanks blinds to cut the light off.  \nStrings black thread like the widow.\n\nIt’s only in your dreams,  \nHalf as real as it seems…  \nIt’s only in your dreams,  \nHalf as real as it seems…  \nNow take the glass again,  \nTake the glass again.  \nYou're fighting for your sleep,  \nYou're fighting for your sleep.\n\nWe’re both haunted…  \nBoth sides of the mirror…  \nBoth showing what the other fears…  \nBoth reaching at a wheel to steer…\n\nA body….long in motion…. \n\n---Both Sides Of The Mirror---\n\nThe Known Factory is the work of musician Known Fact.
