For this very reason was my genesis painting for this project.\n\nI create artwork combining my photography and digital painting. I called it “Digital Bodypainting Project” \nI do a photo session with a model with the project in mind, to get the “canvas” I will need for the digital bodypainting.\nSometimes just working with just the shape of the body and others working with the texture of the skin.\n\nGalaxies, Nature, Landscape and seascape are the themes I prefer.\n \nThank you\nVincent",
