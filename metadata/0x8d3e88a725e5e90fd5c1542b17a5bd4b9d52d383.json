    "description": "Number 1 of 30. Today is the last day of the year. Ten minutes before the year ends, here in my hometown, where I grew up till 19. I ran away and made my own path. Faulty but sublime refers to how I lived from that moment onward. The choices I made may be good or bad, but they are my choices that make them sublime. This Artwork Is a celebration of my courage. I mostly did what I wanted in my life so far. I should remember to keep trusting myself and walk my path no matter how hard, difficult, or impossible.",
