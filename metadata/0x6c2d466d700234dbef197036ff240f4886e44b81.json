    "description": "\"Metamorphoses\" by Miss AL Simpson 100 iterations 31/05/2023  \n============================================================  \n  \n**Miss AL Simpson**, an award-winning crypto artist, has been at the forefront of the web3 movement since 2018. Renowned for her distinctive style, she seamlessly merges digital graffiti with animated 3D historical motifs. Notably, *AL Simpson* has embarked on pioneering AI collaborations that push the boundaries of traditional art paradigms. By embracing the potential of artificial intelligence as a creative partner, she redefines the future of crypto art.  \n* * *  \n  \nAs part of the curated group exhibition *\"Do Androids Dream About Electric Sheep?\"* by Kate Vass Galerie, opening on 31/05, Miss AL Simpson presents her first AI long-form project *\"Metamorphoses.\"* This series comprises 100 unique live-generated iterations and serves as the beginning of the ongoing show. Drawing inspiration from the epic poem *\"Metamorphoses\"* by the Roman poet *Ovid*, **Miss AL Simpson** embarks on a novel approach for a long-form project. The mythological tales within *Ovid*'s work explore themes of transformation, encompassing love, desire, power, and social and political climate, often incorporating themes of transformation and change that mirror the turbulence of our current society.  \n**Miss AL Simpson**'s rendition of *\"Metamorphoses\"* is a timeless and enduring series of works. *Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\"* has profoundly influenced Western literature and art for centuries. **Miss AL Simpson** draws upon these timeless stories to explore the complex relationship between AI and humanity. For instance, in the tale of **Narcissus**, who becomes transfixed by his reflection, *Simpson* finds a parallel to humans fixating on the output of AI, perceiving it as conscious and relatable rather than recognizing it as the product of an algorithm. With masterful skill, she adapts the themes of transformation and the interplay between the human and AI realms, resonating with contemporary audiences. Leveraging the capabilities of *0KAI*, *Miss AL Simpson* develops her concept by employing prompts and a combination of traits and rarities, blending the poems with her earlier analogue artwork from 2018 to create a beautiful body of work.  \n* * *  \n  \n*\"Metamorphoses\"* will be presented as a Dutch auction on May 31, 2023, at 8 pm (CET) on https://0kai.k011.com, offering art enthusiasts an opportunity to engage with and acquire this remarkable collection.  \n",
