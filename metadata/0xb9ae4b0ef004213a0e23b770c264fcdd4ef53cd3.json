    "description": "This classic Steadman image dates from the original Gonzo days with Hunter S Thompson. As one can see, creatures have always figured somewhere in his work. When we first started working together on portraying different species, I remember asking Ralph whether he had always been interested in wildlife and he said he didn’t believe so, but he would investigate it. Then the next day he phoned me and said, “They’re everywhere! They’re pouring out of my drawers! I’ve been looking through old work and found animals and birds in so many drawings and I don’t remember drawing most of them. I must have been doing this subconsciously. It shows my mind is a weirrrd thing.” Thank God for Ralph’s brain!",
