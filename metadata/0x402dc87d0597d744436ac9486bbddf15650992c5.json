    "description": "“Via Montenegro” is a series of videos and photographs captured while traveling through my home country - Montenegro. \n\nFrom mountains to streets, seaside and countryside, to unique moments and heavenly views.\n\nYou could say it’s a slice of life, my life. It’s all the moments I like coming back to.\nI decided to share these moments with you, with the idea to promote this tiny Balkan country and its wild beauty, but also to share this amazing footage and photos I am selfishly holding onto. Enjoy, and come visit!\n\n--\n\n\"Sunset in Montenegro\" is a short video I captured with my DJI Osmo Pocket while experiencing a breathtaking view on the seaside of Montenegro. \n\n3840x2160px, 4K / MP4 VIDEO\n\n--\n\nSee more on my Instagram - @lukapsd",
