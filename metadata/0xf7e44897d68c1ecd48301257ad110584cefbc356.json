    "description": "A scene straight out of the movie Independence Day unfolded in a small Texas town on the evening of May 22nd, 2022. An enormous supercell structure moved overhead with just incredible structure. I have never seen such a dramatic sky at night with all of the layers this supercell contained. It felt like you were staring up at an UFO coming in for landing. \n\nThis storm earlier in the evening put down 2 very large wedge tornadoes. This storm also contained some insane dust and winds being sucked into the storm like a vacuum. This made it incredibly difficult to photograph as wind/dust was whipping up everywhere making it hard to keep a tripod stable. \n\nMay 22nd, 2022 - Morton/Levelland, TX\n\nNikon D850 - Sigma FineArt 14-24mm @14mm,\nF/4, ISO-1000, Shutter - 2sec. \n",
