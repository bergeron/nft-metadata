    "description": "In 2019 I had a performance for my fabric design in Italy. First I printed my textile design on the fabric. Then my Ballerina friends danced with my fabrics. While the audience enjoyed the performance. I was sitting in a corner. drawing from their movements in my notebook. Then I performed their fashion illustration with marker technique and polychromes and watercolor. Now I have done my illustrations with digital painting and I'm converting them to NFT. ",
