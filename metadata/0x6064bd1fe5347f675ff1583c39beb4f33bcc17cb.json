    "description": "Watching the ocean in motion is one of my favourite feelings in the world. Growing up near the beach, I was so intrigued by the way the ocean was ever-changing and multifaceted - each wave unique with itâ€™s own character.\n\nI woke up early for sunrise and waited. The sea was calm, the golden sunlight slowly leaking into the day,  bringing the ocean to life. Every 15 seconds or so a single golden wave would roll through, break in perfect formation, and then dissipate onto the beach. Rinse and repeat. Another beautiful morning with waves that will never be replicated in the exact same way ever again.\n\n1/1 NFT original comes with the option of a signed print.",
