    "description": "The feeling that every work I produce with productive art evokes in me is different. \nSometimes I sense simple and superficial, sometimes complex and deep meanings. \nWhat I feel in this piece is the light of hope. It is the only abstract concept that allows us to continue living in our darkest times and has no opposite in this reality we live in. \nWhen you feel pessimistic or lost in a great void, all you need to remember is 'There is always hope'.",
