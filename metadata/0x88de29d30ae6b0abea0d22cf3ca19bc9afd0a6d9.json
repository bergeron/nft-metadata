    "description": "*Orange Bunny* was my first ever NFT. He is undoubtedly my favorite too.   \n\nBefore I started on a larger project based on my bunnies on OpenSea, Orange bunny was what started that vision. It made me believe Crypto Fruit Bunnies had potential. \n\nOrange bunny is thoughtful and serious bunny, but he is always thinking about you.",
