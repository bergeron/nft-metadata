    "description": "The Whispering Witches {of Poland}, are a clandestine faction of haunting women who heal in whispers. \nThis particular piece embodies my own vision of one of these witches centered around Poland's national flower; the poppy. They have been cultivated for centuries and used medicinally, in the kitchen and magickally. The poppy is feminine and resonates to the energy of the moon.",
