    "description": "Macro is confusing and we need help navigating these chaotic waters.\n\nThat’s why we bring on Lyn Alden. She gives us a wholistic view on the current macro environment, from inflation to bank runs and insolvency, to how crypto fits into all of this. \n\nLyn has the answers and she always hits the market.\n\nArtwork generated from timestamp [1:08:02 - 1:08:17] “I think the long arc of time points to this becoming relevant on a global scale. It’s already relevant for people. It’s relevant for individual Nigerians, it’s relevant for individual Argentinians. Individual people in Lebanon. It’s already a global money for people.” \n\n10% of proceeds donated to Bankless DAO.",
