    "description": "Exploring motion on Film. Put a moving subject in front of an old film camera and see how it processes the speed and light to create unique and unrepeatable frames of Photography. \n\nEach photoshoot produces completely different results. Not knowing what will work or not work is an exiting aspect of experimenting with motion in film photography. Possibilities are endless. Creativity is key. A bit of luck is always welcome.\n\nUsing a - Leica Mini\nTaken on - AgfaPhoto Apx 400 35mm \nDeveloped by - OnFilmLab.de",
