    "description": "They tell you that the choice is always yours. They tell you that you are the creator of your own destiny.\nAnd you, you're sitting all alone in your room, wondering what your life would have been like if you'd agreed to go on this wild journey 10 years ago. Perhaps now you would be living in a bungalow on a forgotten island, waking up in the morning to the sounds of seagulls and a ray of blinding sunlight shining on your calm, peaceful face.\nAnd you repeating to yourself that - Everything in our life is a matter of our choice. And we will never know what's behind that door until we dare to open it and step inside…………………\n\nUsing existing material I transform emotions, experiences and feelings into fragments of a non-existent life. I'm trying to find answers to questions that have no answers.\nCreated in After Effects & Photoshop | 2000×2000 | Martin Mitty (a.k.a. Innokentii Kashin). 2022.",
