    "description": "[https://www.deathclock.live/](https://www.deathclock.live/)\n\nDeveloped by DIS in collaboration with Special Offer, Inc. and Chain/Saw, Death Clock is a serial NFT project in which you are invited to provide personal data (age, gender, screen time etc.) in order to mint a personal Death Clock NFT, which estimates how much time you have left on Earth and stores your date and time of death on-chain. Death Clock NFTs can be bought and sold, but with each transfer the clock is reborn.\n\nTime is crucial in the engineering and ideology of the blockchain. Transactions are secured by timestamping; the infrastructure is chronologically enforced as each transaction hash contains the timestamp of the previous block of transactions, forming a chain of blocks; block time determines how fast a blockchain can grow; data is tamper-proof and thus permanent and thus eternal, even if the blockchain is only a few years old; speed and FOMO often define the experience of trading with crypto. Death Clock establishes a relation between the limited, uncertain time of human life and the indifferent, distributed, infinite time of the blockchain infrastructure, and contrasts the speculative drive of flippers by generating a “soulbound” NFT, to use a term that Vitalik Buterin borrowed from the world of gaming: non-transferable NFTs that define who you are and that can only belong to whoever minted them.",
