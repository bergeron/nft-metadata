    "description": "Thank you for looking at this photo.\n\nIn Japan, there is a custom called \"Obon\". At that time of the year, people who have left for the cities come back to their hometowns.\nWhen I took this photo, I thought of the people returning home.\n\nA bus heading for the big Irimichi cloud. The place where the clouds used to be is now under construction for the Shinkansen line and will probably never be photographed again. This is a miracle shot.\n\nThis photo got 63,000 likes on Twitter.\n\nPhoto size 14.9MB\n",
