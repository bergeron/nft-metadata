    "description": "society ... is hypocritical and cancels you out, if you think differently from them if you don't go with the flow .... but your voice counts. You have the right to speak your mind, share information, and demand a better world. You also have the right to agree or disagree with those in power and to express your opinions about it ... the heads abuse their authority and if they see that they can't control your way of thinking they cancel you.... society ... is a joke\n\nBlue and Pink \n\nA series of illustrations that represent metaphors, desires, and experiences of myself, uniting fantasy and reality without distinctions",
