    "description": "Average Goldfish is a limited collection of 555 Goldfish as part of the first collection in the Average BoB NFT collection.\n\nGrowing up, Average BoB was given his first Goldfish for his birthday from his mother. Ever since then Average BoB has always owned an Average Goldfish. Throughout the years Average Bob has had many Average Goldfish, some gold ones, yellow ones, blue ones, big and small ones, some mashy and some pineappled. \n​\nAnd in general, anything but Average.\n​\nKnowing how passionate Average BoB is about his Average Goldfish, we felt that we couldn't release Average BoB into the world without his Average Goldfish by his side. \n\nCreated by GavinS and some traits supplied by, Pixlcanz and petetheo.\n\nhttps://www.averagebob.co",
