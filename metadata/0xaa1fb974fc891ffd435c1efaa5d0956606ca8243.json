    "description": "My neighborhood is near Uluabat Lake. After the rain, I went for a walk by the lake with my friend. We found a small puddle during the walk. In this puddle, the reflections of trees and clouds looked great. But I looked for a movement to live here, and I wanted my friend to be a model for the photo. So this image came out.\nOur lives can be very bad sometimes. But that depends on which way we're looking at it. It may be possible to see better when we change our perspective. If I hadn't paid attention to this little muddy puddle, this photo wouldn't have happened.\n\nCollection: Between Black and White\nArtist: Recep ELAL\nLocation: Uluabat Lake, Bursa, Trkey\nSize: 5911 x 4000 px 300 dpi\nType: JPEG\nDate: 26 February 2022\n\nAbout Artist:\nHi, I'm Recep ELAL. i've been interested in photography and video since 2012.
