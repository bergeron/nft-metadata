    "description": "The modern person’s internal questionnaire:\nwhat’s it all for?\nam i doing the most?\ncompared to everybody else?\ncan i… ?\nwill i… ?\nwhat if… ?\nthe \nlist\ngoes\non\nand \non \nand\non…\n\nToo often do we get stuck in this cycle, lost in it’s feedback until our thoughts become a piercing hiss. Is searching for something that matters comparatively to societies expectations of happiness, success, beauty, freedom, etc. “healthy”? How can we re-examine our internal dialogue to project a “healthier” reality that may have been there all along? \n\nSure, making music is a form of therapy to help cope with these questions; providing a space for ourselves to explore without boundaries or judgement. Furthermore, sharing that music can allow it’s listener to sort through some existential questions of there own. Divert a crisis perhaps, gain a new perspective, reach for forgiveness instead of anger, or simply alleviate life’s struggles for 3 brief minutes. Enjoy! \n\n\nWritten, Produced, Mixed, & Mastered by NBF at our studio at the legendary Sound City Center in Van Nuys, CA. \n\nArtwork by Jeffery LaLiberté \n",
