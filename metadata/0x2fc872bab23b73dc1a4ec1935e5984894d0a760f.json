    "description": "Specimen : HYBRID animal half octopus half \"human brain\" (Octopus vulgaris - Cerebrum)\n\nConservation status : every year, 130,000 tons of wild octopus are consumed in Europe, twice as much as ten years ago.\n\nThe work and its history: OCTO-CEREBRUM© is an octopus with a human brain. I was amazed and charmed by this unusual animal which has no less than three hearts, eight arms, nine brains and blue blood. Octopuses smell, taste, and are curious, they analyze their environment with their eight tentacles able to grow back in case of amputation. According to a new study led by the Max Delbruck Center in Berlin, this intelligence could be due to their human-like brain. \n\nIts message: OCTO-CEREBRUM© demonstrates and reveals the height of its intelligence.\n\nFloriane Lisowski, OCTO-CEREBRUM, 2023, 3D, video .mp4, 10 sec, ‪2048 x 2048‬ px, Edition 1/1, Collection Hybridation",
