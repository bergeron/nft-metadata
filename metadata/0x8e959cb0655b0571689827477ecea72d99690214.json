    "description": "Proud to share the first in the \"Watching\" collection:  \na study that aims to capture candid moments observed through subjects.  \n\nWhat captivated me at the time that I took this photo was the story being told through the jacket alone. \"EAT SHiT AND DiE\" written on the back as, from the shadows, he watches a band joyfully perform together on Bourbon Street.\n\nShot on 35mm Tri-X 400.",
