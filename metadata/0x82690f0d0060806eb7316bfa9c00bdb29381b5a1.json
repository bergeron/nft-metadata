    "description": "It was like a sensation, she was the owner of that terror that we always try to avoid, that mystery that we will ALL figure out sooner or later.  \nAt some point I saw her, she seemed to ignore me, but I know that she wanted to take me to her kingdom, her very presence already indicated danger to me, and I also felt something so strange that I still can't explain very well, it's a mixture of senses, it's the smell of a light that is already going out, something very weird; while everything happens, my predecessors occupy the heavy atmosphere trying to embrace their old home...\n\nThe sweat and chills that possessed my body suddenly wakes me up, making me believe that it was only a dream, that I am safe, but my mind lies to me, my brain doesn't want to assimilate it, but I am resigned, I know that her arms will embrace my neck and that my spirit imprisoned in leather walls, which today is terrified by this premonition, will escape into the world of those who are no longer afraid...\n\nDigital Painting Fully made in Photoshop  \nResolution: 6201 x 8681 px\n\nSPECIAL ARTWORK  \nThis piece is a gift for the collectors of the Solum's Pieces",
