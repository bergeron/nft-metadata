    "description": "This entire EP was written, produced, mixed and mastered in 48 hours. Kevin and I set ourselves a challenge to not question any creative decision we made. To entirely act on instinct. There's something enlightening about being against the clock. Decisions that previously were arduous and sometimes impossible to make became easy. The resulting music isn't perfect, but it's some of the most honest and raw stuff that we've made and we're both immensely proud of it. We hope you enjoy this insight into our creative process and remember to trust your instincts. \n ",
