    "description": "Draugr is an extrasolar planet in the Virgo constellation,  too far away to get a close-up view with our telescopes.  But the landscape can be recreated using a fluid-erosion algorithm written in vanilla JS.   The algorithm autonomously carves valleys, canyons or mountains, creating an artist impression of the planet within minutes.\n  \nPng 4096x4096 pixels.   Created in feb 2022 by Matthijs Keuper ",
