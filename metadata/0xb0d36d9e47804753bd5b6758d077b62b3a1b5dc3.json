    "description": "The girl here in the picture looking directly into my soul questioning me do you see my beauty or do u see my pain? Then I couldn’t reply because I wanted to project the same thing with the viewers too. She is beautiful, and also she had a few dreams. And when I asked her about her dreams She smiled with a little hesitation & said Brother If you can help please make our story, please let us have a home and help us in having our studies. \nI have questioned myself, I wasn’t broke but I was questioned. So, I wanted to make this picture speak to someone who can help. \nPhotographer Name: Arun Kumar Nalimela\nEdition: 1/1 \nDimensions: 5304 × 7952\nLicense: As long as the creator is credited, the primary NFT holder can use the NFT in advertising, to display privately and in groups, and to create virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays.
