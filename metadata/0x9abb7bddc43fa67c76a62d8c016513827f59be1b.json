    "description": "POW NFT 1. The genesis token, the first token ever created with Proof of Work NFT mining.\n\nPOW NFT atoms are generated according to a scarcity model relative to the natural distribution of elements. The element, ionic charge and generative properties of the render are all determined by the token’s hash – an unpredictable result of the mining process.\n\nAtoms are rendered as a Live Model, this model is contained in the metadata and can be displayed in any browser. The video is a short capture of the live model. The metadata also contains a poster, which is a still rendering of the Atom optimised for print.\n\nPOW NFTs are the first ever mineable NFT, and are mined with an increasing level of difficulty using Proof of Work – a fundamental feature of blockchain first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper. When a POW NFT is mined, a unique and increasingly rare ERC-721 token is created. The mining process prevents front-running and network congestion while maintaining security, and parallel mining-difficulty and price-demand-curves create natural, market-driven scarcity. \n",
