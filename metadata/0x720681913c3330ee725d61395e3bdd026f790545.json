    "description": "MADGOD2.001 (2000) was the first full-length dance-media performance by Ventura for which the entire choreography was created with the aid of choreography software. This excerpt shows both the animation and the dancer's interpretation.\n\nSoftware-based simulations of the human body constitute formal and disembodied abstractions which opens up the possibility of introducing algorithmic and computational methods into the choreographic process of working with the human body. \n\nThe invention of transformation rules to algorithmically generate novel animated dance sequences led to a further distortion of the movement capabilities of a human body. The application of these principles intentionally broke the wholeness of the human body by modulating it in isolated elements that were manipulated separately. By decorrelating the movements of these isolated body elements, the natural synchronisation and balancing of a professional stage dancer was broken down and replaced by a machine-like control",
