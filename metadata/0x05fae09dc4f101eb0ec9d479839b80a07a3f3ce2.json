    "description": "This is the 1st 1/1 unique NFT in a collection of 6 photographs.\n\nSize: 4662 x 7000 px\n\nBali for me is first of all about freedom.\n\nFreedom of self-expression, freedom from unnecessary thoughts, from unnecessary actions. \n\nHere I learned to concentrate more on what I like and what really matters. It was as if life was cleared of BS. \n\nAll that was left was the essence. \n\nThat's where I really learned how to be happy no matter what the circumstances. \n\nIt opened me up, my soul.  \n\nThere is an opinion that the island does not accept some people. \n\nIt seems to me that this is when a person resists, is not ready to change, to take lessons for the growth of the soul. But if you are open to everything, then the island is open to you. \n\nBali is my great love.\n",
