    "description": "This is a physical drawing which has a very small digital details too! This is the first work that I put up for sale in this space and it represents me and my personality!\nA strong and independent girl who is actually an architect and you can understand this by the buildings that are drawn above her head.\nAnd at the same time, in Her dreams, she is an artist who portrays Her art in an environment full of color and beauty by combining different cultures, and of course She knows what she wants from this world.\nPS: there will be a day that some unbelievable information will come out of these paintings and will surprise everyone.
