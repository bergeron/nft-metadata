    "description": "Collaboration of  the artists Pablo E. Peña P. and Remedios where two languages from the analog and the digital come together around a common vision.\n\nUsing the patterns, textures and colors of Remedios' works, Pablo creates an algorithm that generates abstract geometries, particles and colors that flow organically around the “Chrysina” beetle.\n\nEach piece in the series is a unique and unpredictable result, the balance between the rich pictorial work of Remedios and the processes in programming and design of generative art of Pablo give rise to a work as a whole where the individual representations of nature and its connection to memory.\n\nchrysinaunpredictable.com",
