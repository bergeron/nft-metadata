    "description": "Exurban is an experimental project that explores the intersection of AI and art. Using a state-of-the-art image generation model, the project generates unique abstract images that are constantly evolving. These images are then displayed on a webpage using P5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The website allows visitors to explore the generated images and discover new patterns and shapes. The project aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI and inspire new forms of artistic expression",
