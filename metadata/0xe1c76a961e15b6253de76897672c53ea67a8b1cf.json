According to The Conference of the Birds a book by Attar of Nishapur a famous Iranian poet, a group of birds climbed Mount Qaf (mystical mountain) in order to reach the truth and exaltation of the soul, but due to the difficulty of the path and the lack of purity.\n At the end, only thirty of them remained and reached the perfection and attained enlightenment.
