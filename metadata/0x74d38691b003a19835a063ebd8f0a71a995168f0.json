    "description": "一期一会 translates to \"One time, one meeting\"; but in Japanese ZEN Buddhism it's interpreted as \"For this time only\".  \n \nThis refers to the practice of treasuring the unrepeatable nature of a moment.  \nBy achieving this practice, the moment remains sealed in our memories since not the future nor the past can change it.\n\nI use reflections to create a juxtaposition that blends two worlds recontextualizing the entire scene.  \nThe lights on both sides of the glass create a grid that frames the subject in a world where she appears to be surrounded by others; but thanks to the strong contrast in color temperature between her and the remaining elements there’s a hint about an explicit separation, suggesting an introspective journey.\n\nBy: Ilan Derech Collection: Dreaming Tokyo  \nShot on: Leica SL & ZEISS ZM 1.4/35  \nLocation: Toyko, Japan Year: 2021 \nwww.ilanderech.com",
