Palazzo Pamhpilj\n100x70 cm, oil on canvas, 2019\nExhibitions:\nBoomer gallery, London, 2021\nArt Russia 2020\nThe artpiece was lost in 2022 \n\n\nI didn’t know I have a soul,\nthat wants to speak, that’s looking for a way out.\nI didn’t know there was something that had no name,\nUntil you say it yourself,\nThat floods you, and it comes flooding in\nAnd won’t let you think or plan,\nIt’s vague, it’s powerful, it’s uncertain.\nAnd there’s nothing you can do to stop it,\nTill you can put it into words\nTill you know it’s a need\nTo speak, and to be heard.\n\n26. 06. 2019\n\nW. Maria",
