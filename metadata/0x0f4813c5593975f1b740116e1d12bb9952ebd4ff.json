    "description": "\"The tigers have found me\" represents the inner conflicts, problems, negative feelings and adversities that life offers us while \"and I do not care\" is just my answer to all this. This artwork is one of my few ones to be set outdoor and the title is references to the last sentence of \"For Jane\" by Charles Bukowski.\n\nThis artwork will be sold in cooperation with Galerie Nagel Draxler on the occasion of Art Basel 2021.",
