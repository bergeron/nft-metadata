    "description": "It's not that faeries were incapable of remembering anything, it's that for the most part, they simply didn't feel the need to. If it wasn't relevant to the games they were playing, they would cast it from their minds like flower petals tossed to the wind. And besides, why would they rely on their own memory when they had faeries such as Eldmyrr? This peculiar old faun had been around for centuries, and most importantly, remembered nearly all that he'd seen and heard. The only difficulty lied in reaching him. Using his crafty imagination and power over nature, Eldmyrr hid himself deep within a thriving, verdant lair to trick and test any who wished to see him. For despite his age, he was far from done playing games, and was always interested in seeing who possessed enough resilience and cunning to reach him, and what sort of questions they'd bring along.",
