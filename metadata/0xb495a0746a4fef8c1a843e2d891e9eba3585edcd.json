    "description": "I have a (bad) habit of staying up all night until 7 AM working on music because sometimes that’s the only time of day I’m able to pursue my passions. ‘7AM’ is about the workaholic tendencies we fall into when we become addicted to progress, desperate to make our dreams a reality. This record is about the dangers of conflating productivity with self worth, and a reminder that great things take time, so we have to take care of ourselves in the process.\n\nWritten, produced & engineered by RMS.\n\nJoin the token-gated Telegram chat if you’re a collector! \nhttps://guild.xyz/rms-and-friends\n\n",
