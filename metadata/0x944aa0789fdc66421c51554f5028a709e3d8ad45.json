    "description": "Sometime ago I took my first steps for the second time in my life. It was incredibly exciting and scary\n\nOne day, having passed a long and painstaking path, we understand that the road has not led us to where we would like to go. I think each of us has faced the fear of starting something again when so much has been covered\n\nIt is normal to walk your path, find answers, get lost, realize all your answers are shit, start that search from the beginning. It is a very new road and very first steps in a history of humanity - let's think of it this way. Let's imagine we are the first ones to find that road to happiness. Stop the guilt for not understanding, and start investigating the possibility and sense of new road. And please remember - being not 24/7 strong is not ashamed. It means you are alive\n\nSometime ago I took my first steps for the second time in my life. And I'm not just talking about steps without crutches",
