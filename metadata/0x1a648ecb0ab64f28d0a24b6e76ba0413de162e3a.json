    "description": "This record came out of me taking my first step into new territory, and experimenting with tempos I was previously unfamiliar with. It’s meant to represent the distractions and temptations around me at the time the record was written. \n\nEarly pandemic, spending most of our days in the garage cooking records sun up to sun down, Temptation happened to be the first record Grady and I had finished front to back, and really was the turbo boost that fueled the relationship and art we make today. It set a new bar for our production style and sculpted the nuances of my sound today.\n\nIt’s one of the first records I was able to directly translate the things happening in my current life to a track, and is comprised of three distinct sections. The calm before the storm, the storm itself, and flood that follows.",
