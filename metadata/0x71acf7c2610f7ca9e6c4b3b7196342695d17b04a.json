    "description": "What does it mean to be truly timeless? Is it simply outlasting all the rest? Or is it making such a profound impact on the present, that your presence is felt throughout time? I explored this concept with expired film. Creating art with a medium that for all intents & purposes should have faded long ago. I learned that certain scenes will leave an impact on you long after they happen. They are timeless.\n\nThis moment is now forever on the blockchain amplifying, yet again, the timelessness of this point in time.\n\nThis photo is the capstone to the project Borrowed Time. It was taken on expired Fujifilm Superia 400 with the Contax G1.",
