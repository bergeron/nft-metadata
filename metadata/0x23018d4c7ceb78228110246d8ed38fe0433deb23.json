    "description": "Juicy Lucy wants you to know that she’s not putting up with your shit any more.\n\nYou’ve been a filthy little degen, and it’s time you showed some respect.  \n\nIn fact, why don’t you confess your web3 sins. Write them down on the desk in front of you. That embarrassing shitcoin you bought that went to zero. That awful Discord you schmoozed before flipping their NFT the moment it dropped.\n\nYou. Savage. \n\nNow bang your head against the desk. Repeatedly. Until you see sense… sense or stars… she doesn’t care. You are going to treat her like she deserves to be treated. She’s not some ugly little 10k tramp. \n\nWhile you’re doing that, she’s going to roll a joint, light it up, find her favourite Riot Grrrl album, jam it into her 8-track, and scream her lungs out. \n\nNo one here is taking notice\nNo outline will ever hold us\n\nIt’s not a new wave. it’s just you and me!",
