    "description": "The episode that started it all. Justin Drake, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, proposes how the implementation of EIP 1559 and Proof of Stake advances ETH into the next evolution of sound money: Ultra Sound Money. \n\nThis is the episode that coined the Ultra Sound Money meme and one of the most iconic episodes from the Bankless Vault. \n\nArtwork generated from the timestamp [30:23 - 30:47] â€œWhen you combine these two things together, economic security and economic efficiency, then out pops kind of something amazing, which is economic scarcity, but not just the standard vanilla kinda of capped supply, economic scarcity, but a new paradigm, which you could call ultra sound money.  \n\n10% of proceeds go to ultrasound.eth, the organization behind [https://ultrasound.money/]\n\nETH is ultra sound money ðŸ¦‡ðŸ”Š",
