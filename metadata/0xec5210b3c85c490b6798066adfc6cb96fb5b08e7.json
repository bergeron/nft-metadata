    "description": "Last Part V. - site specific installation, 150x140x60cm, sand, gifts of the sea, Sepangar, Borneo, Malaysia 2022\n\nDo we assemble reality from parts, or do we disassemble it piece by piece in order to get to its core and then assemble a new reality from the disassembled parts? One that we will want to understand because we created it in our own image? The last part as a puzzle in the composition of our knowledge, in which what is just an illusion today can be a new reality tomorrow.\n\nArtwork was created as the real physical installation in Malaysia, but was destroyed after finishing and does not exist in reality anymore. Only in digital documentation.\n\nIf the first holder wants, he can get: \n- exclusive paper print from the limited edition 01/10 in size 61x76,2 cm  \n- catalog book with my site-specific works and texts  \n- one hour online personal talk with me\n\nArtwork by Patrik Prosko",
