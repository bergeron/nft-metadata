    "description": "Australian Native Flowers are the focal point of this collection. For natives to flourish they must undergo extreme and adverse conditions like wildfires before they can emerge from the darkness.\n\nVulnerable and fragile but with an infinite inner strength, singular and resolute, this flora is a visual metaphor for resilience and love.  \n\n\n\n6000px x 4000px\n\nFranca Turrin\nPhotographic Artist \nSydney, Australia",
