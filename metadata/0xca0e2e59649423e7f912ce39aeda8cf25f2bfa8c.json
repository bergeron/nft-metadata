    "description": "Art for Zombies, a collection of 1024 ai-generated brains for those with cerebral tastes. In an environment where artists of all types can create anything they want with ai, the only way an artist can set himself apart is by building and curating art around a focused theme; for Morph_VGArt that theme is about the challenge of expanding one's creativity around a solo subject - the brain. By collecting a piece, you are supporting the drive to hone ai-artists' creativity not on the quality of the output, but the ability to stretch your creativity to new limits. Additionally, Morph_VGArt is donating 1/3rd of the proceeds to a charity that helps children with ADHD find success in life, which hits close to home as his child and other family members live with the condition. If you're a zombie with a heart, you are welcome in this movement, and this collection is just the first big step in making that vision come true.",
