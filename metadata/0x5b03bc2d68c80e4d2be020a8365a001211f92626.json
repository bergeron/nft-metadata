    "description": "Poombarai is a small village in Kodaikanal, Tamilnadu, India. I had visited this place in 2014. I happened to see this boy.  His face and eyes are mesmerizing. I wanted to take a portrait of him. I asked him for permission to take a portrait. I took a few portraits of him and this one came out well. \n\nInternational Awards\n\nPrix de la Photographie Paris (Px3) 2014 - Silver Award in Portraiture/Children\nND Awards 2014 - Honorable Mention\nShoot The Face April 2014 - Finalist\n\nArtist: - Mahesh Balasubramanian\n\nEdition: 1/1\nDate: 22-Feb-2014\nDimensions: 5203 x 3469, 300 DPI",
