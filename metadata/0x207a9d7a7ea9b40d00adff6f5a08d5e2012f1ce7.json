    "description": "This collection of photos is formed around a color palette inspired by Van Gogh's paintings, in general it is a religious tribute to this painter, but elements that are very important to me are included in it, the most important of which is minimalism.  and the choice of color are suitable and after that is the form, in this collection of photos, the relationship between different frames has been tried to be preserved and a continuous collection has been created. There is a special focus on the look of the subject and the lighting is done in such a way that it has a sense and mood that matches the colors and the subject and the whole space.\n\n4254 × 5318 px",
