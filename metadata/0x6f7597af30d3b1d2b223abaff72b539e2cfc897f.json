    "name": "The Fluid Batheress",
    "description": "“The Fluid Batheress” is my contemporary, obvious abstract interpretation of an oil painting by Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres, a French classicist oil painter. Ingres called his painting “The Small Bather”, finished it 1826 and depicts a woman, leisurely sitting in a bath. \n\nI interpreted the painting with heavy-body and high flow acrylics, as well as acrylic inks.  \n\nDigitally it has a dimension of 2500x3100px, the physical artwork is in private collection and not for sale.",
