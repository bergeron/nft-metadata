    "description": "I want to make a new sea and propose an alternative to \"crypto punks” by launching a new trend «crypto boys“ and would be grateful if you support me. Sometimes mankind forgets that \"Everything genius is simple\" Today NFT artists focus on the graphics, but not on the meaning of the work! We are between art and the crypto world, the balance must be in simplicity. I have been thinking for a long time about how to create beauty and communicate it to the viewer, and eventually I realized that the trend is focus, but in different shades)\n\n",
