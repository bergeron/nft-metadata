    "name": "Yggdrasil",
    "description": "In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the massive tree whose roots and branches stretch through the nine realms of time and space. The concept of a great tree on whose body rests the world, though, transcends any culture, and the four-dimensional structure of spacetime evokes a similar metaphor. We are the fruit of the tree of time, and as we are born we become its stewards. In this token we see the image of a tree appearing in front of metatron’s cube, a sacred geometric design which contains schematic information for all of the platonic solids, those mathematically perfect shapes that were once theorized to be the building blocks of reality. Yggdrasil is the icon of cosmic unity; the blend between the divine feminine chaos of nature, and the divine masculine order of math.\n\n The tree illustration used in the Yggdrasil token was crafted by St. Louis artist Shawn Gaston, and its visual design was assembled by Anthromancer’s director, Daniel James Drake; The card back design was created by Calen Blake; and the 3d model used in this token was compiled by Richard Darling.",
