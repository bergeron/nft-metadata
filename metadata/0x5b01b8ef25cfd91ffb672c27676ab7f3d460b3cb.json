    "description": "This well-known spot shattered all previous perception of desert beauty for me. This oasis changes annually as new floods and water flow push away the soft earth and form new giant features like this cliff edge and pool. After a very dry trip into the desert, this water gives life through the canyon, and endless enjoyment.\n\n- This mint has been offset to be carbon negative (even if it isn't purchased)\n- First collector has option to receive 20x30 metal print at no additional cost.\n- After original NFT sale, only a current collector can buy IRL prints.\n- Most importantly, the sale and resale of this NFT supports me to work on my next photography project. Thank you.\n\n- 5304x7952\n- *Edition 1/1*",
