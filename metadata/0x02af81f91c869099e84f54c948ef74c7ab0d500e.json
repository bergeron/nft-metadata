    "description": "I will write briefly. The main thing. February 24th. Horror. Fear. Hatred. \nLong road. Another country. But the horror of what is happening is the same. Hatred for all Russians who are involved in the war. \nI want to back home. There are my family and loved ones. There, at home - war. \nWhile we are here, we will help our country win.\nThat's what this post was made for. The illustration is being sold at auction and half of the proceeds will go to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. \nGlory to Ukraine! I will definitely come back home.\n\nResolution: 6425x4500px  300dpi",
