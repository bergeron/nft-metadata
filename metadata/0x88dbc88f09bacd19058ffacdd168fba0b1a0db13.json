    "description": "Each art piece has a meaning behind it which is meant to be discovered by the viewer. It can be a message, a calling, a sign, or simply a way to connect with the simplicity and beauty in the world. Maybe the meaning is even not having any meaning at all, but just to connect with the piece emotionally.  \n\nWhat does this piece says? How is the title connected with the art? \nI let it speak by itself, without me, the author, describing what was my intention when created. But I'm open to chat about it if you wish. \n\nArt done by Magusz, on Procreate.\n\nTwitter and Instagram: magusz_art  \nWebsite: https://maguszart.com/",
