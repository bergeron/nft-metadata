    "description": "More than a year has passed from the desire to make this shoot to the realization of the idea. \nIt was not easy to fight for shooting in the style of a brilliant artist. I admire Caravaggio's painting, as a true genius he was far ahead of his time. \nI immediately decided that the light would be one of the actors of the shooting. Therefore, it was important for me to find a location with good natural light, and to place accents with additional light sources.\nThe classic plot requires no explanation. \nSpecial thanks to the models and my entire team, without which I would not have coped.\n",
