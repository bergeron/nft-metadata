    "description": "mingle showcases the world around our mems. the infinite array of moments that we all “mingle” with. each piece of art will contain a spread of scattered characters; their placement, quantity, and color randomly based on a unique algorithm. in addition, the pieces feature generative window scenes portraying the location of each “mingle”. quick fun fact: each ‘place’ will be drawn with comparatively accurate “elevation” and curved to degree of the actual land, in real life. we’re sparing no details. same with the grass. more trees in arkansas than madrid? arkansas will receive a richer shade of green. every corner of this collection will offer our collectors the ability to find value and the joy of discovering an easter egg. All pieces, we hope, will resonate with people differently. scenes that echo specific memories from the past, or ones planned for the future. all outputs have been crafted to guarantee that the art is not only aesthetically captivating, but harmonious in its color palette. examples can be found below, as you can see — quite flirty of an idea",
