    "description": "VT70 is an animated NFT art collection that reflects on the restrictions and limitations faced by women in the past, particularly in the United States. The art pieces show women longing for the freedoms and opportunities they see on television, but being unable to attain them due to societal and cultural barriers. As you delve deeper into the collection, you may discover meanings that invite you to explore and interpret the artwork in your own way. The collection uses surrealism and animation to convey a sense of longing and frustration, and leaves room for interpretation. The collection is meant to be a commentary on one of the many small reasons that may have contributed to the women's freedom movement we see today, and to remember the struggles and progress that have been made in the fight for equality. \n1/5",
