    "description": "a mac application that helps the user navigate family dynamics that may be familiar or unfamiliar. it has been conceived as a puzzle box to unlock and explore, and as a poetic support that can give form to the unnameable. you are welcome to multitask this application with other tasks, such as monitoring email and scanning for viruses. as the family is a process, updates may be distributed in the future.\n\nfor optimal experience, please ensure that text-to-speech is enabled in your mac system preferences. \n\nNOTE: this 32-bit application functions on macos versions prior to catalina. a 64-bit update will be provided when available.",
