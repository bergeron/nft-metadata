    "description": "\"Momento do Gol\" (Goal Moment) is a Phygital artwork that combines the physical and digital realms, creating a hybrid experience occurring in two stages.\n\nMoment 01 - Expectation (Physical artwork)\nIn the first moment, the proposal is to transport the observer on a journey of deconstructed forms that challenge the figurative and provoke a free, profound, and individual interpretation. Breaking away from the imitation of the visible world opens up space for an affectivity that can gradually reveal itself in a personal manner.\n\nMoment 02 - Euphoria (Digital Artwork)\nIn the second moment, the proposal for immersion can be intensified, bringing forth new feelings that potentially enhance the emotional connection. The observer is invited to explore hidden meanings, diving into a journey of movements that transcend inertia and allow the active force behind the intended moment of the artwork to be fully perceived.\n\n8th Brazilian Art Salon in Liechtenstein - June 2023 ",
