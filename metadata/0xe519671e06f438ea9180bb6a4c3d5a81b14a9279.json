    "description": "This picture was taken in the Dolomites when we wanted to reach the Schlegeis Stausee bridge at the top of the mountain. After 1 hour trekking in the rain we got stuck in a storm and we had to stop at a refuge to spend the night there. We finally left the refuge the morning after to access the bridge and we had the chance to take this incredible lightning shot !\n\n\n2594x3243 pixels",
