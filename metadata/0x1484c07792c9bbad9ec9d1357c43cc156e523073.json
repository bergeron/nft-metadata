    "description": "Hugs on Tape satisfies a visceral need for physical contact in the pandemic era. In the early days of the pandemic lockdown we wanted to distribute hug-simulations and share bursts of joy and intimacy. We sent a call out to friends and family requesting recordings of hugs with someone in their pod. The recordings captured tenderness and love among those spending more time than ever together, and a choreography of closeness inside the familiar frame of video, animation, and zoom calls. The series is created with tools ranging from handmade audio/video synthesizers to smartphones and digital animation software. All the patterns and colors in Hugs on Tape are made exclusively with hardware, analog synthesizers and other analog instruments from recording sessions weâ€™ve made over the past 20+years.",
