    "description": "I started doing collage art because of the pandemic. As an photographer the lockdown was specially difficult. So I started making random things in Photoshop.\n\nBut this was my first work that got shared on social media and made me thing twice about the road I was starting. This, I can say, is my genesis. The first time I thought what I was doing has a meaning and a worth. \n\nSo this is my first piece. Explanations are meaningless. Just enjoy the ride.",
