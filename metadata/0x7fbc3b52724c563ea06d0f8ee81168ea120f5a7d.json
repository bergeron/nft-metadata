    "description": "Elite class tribes are the third rarest of the four tribal classes in the Banana Kingdom. Only 150 exist in each region. Holding an Elite class NFT will give you 30 tribal member slots in the region marked on this NFT. As a tribal Chieftain of a Kong class tribe you earn 7.5% of all tokens spent on crafting by all members of your tribe, and 20% of the tokens won in the Tournament of the Elites â€” a monthly tournament exclusive to this class. Your tribe members will also enjoy elevated earnings and the third highest payouts, by percentage.",
