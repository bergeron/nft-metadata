    "description": "At times I wonder if my feelings, hopes, fears, and dreams are the same as my previous generations. carpet-weaver women know how to illustrate these emotions by weaving and I express the same emotions in my paintings.\nIn this collection, I'm trying to create an illustration combined\nwith 2D and 3D spaces.\nthis work is inspired by The motifs in the Qashqai carpet.",
