    "description": "\"The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night\" - KidCudi.\n\nThis piece visualizes Noir's daydreaming, stoned out of his mind. His studio apartment is where he spends all his time. On a quiet night, Noir contemplates whether the eccentricities stemming from his social ineptitude will ever be accepted socially. An outcast, a lonely loner. ",
