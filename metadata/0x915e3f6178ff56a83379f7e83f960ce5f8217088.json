    "description": "This piece of art shows a \"Black Shaman\" represented as a Shaman Priest. Shamans serve as a bridge between both worlds, this world and the underworld/world of the dead.\nBelow is a full breakdown of this art.\n\n The sky represents the danger that envelops us as Blacks and also the powers that govern us.\n\n The shooting stars represents opportunities that are flashed right in front of our eyes and also represents a symbol of hope.\n\n The dry grasses represents the supposed harvest of what was sowed but now as been affected by the Sky (Dangers and powers that rule over the blacks)\n\n The hands coming from the ground represents the ones lost to the race",
