    "description": "Vol.1\n\nSELF CONTROL\n\nThe ability to manage one's impulses, emotions, and behaviors to achieve long-term goals  \nis what separates humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. Self-control is primarily \nrooted in the prefrontal cortex the planning, problem-solving, and decision making center \nof the brain which is significantly larger in humans than in other mammals.\n\nThe richness of nerve connections in the prefrontal cortex enables people to plan, evaluate alternative actions, and ideally avoid doing things they'll later regret, rather than immediately respond to every impulse as it arises.\n\nWhen your thoughts control your actions. It prevents you from moving forward and become  \nthe best version of yourself.",
