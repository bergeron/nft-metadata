    "description": "The media plays a significant and complex role in our lives. To say otherwise is naïve. However, it’s also not accurate to claim that we are simply sheeps, moved to action by what’s on the telly. Our experiences, socialization, education, political views and economic situation are all factors and how we interact with mass information can also change by the medium: We are more likely to internalize what we hear on talk shows as guiding ideas than what we see in violent video games, for example. We recognize propaganda and other persuasive techniques more than we realize; We’re simply too emotional to resist. And we’re capable of identifying the purpose of the media we consume. Ultimately, it falls upon our choice in what we do with that information.",
