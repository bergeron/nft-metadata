    "description": "my genesis drop on Sound (!!!) and the second song in a series of 10 🌸\n\n“leamme lone (붊)” is a track decades in the making, produced by bankx. we’ve been friends since 2002, always dabbled in music together, but never put out an official release — until now. bankx used to say he wanted me to spit in Korean on one of his beats, so i knew i had to kick off the song the way it is now.\n\nthe song itself is a reflective sketch of fading memories, wanting to be alone but not lonely, and all the contradictory emotions of growing up.\n",
