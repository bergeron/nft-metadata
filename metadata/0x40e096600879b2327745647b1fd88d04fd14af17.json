    "description": "Photography has a unique way to change your perspective and narrow your focus. \n\nReality takes on a different shape when viewed through the eyes of your lens. \n\nHours turn into minutes in long shooting sessions in nature, and, occassionaly, you are gifted with a special moment of insight and clarity that turn into a beautiful shot.\n\nThis was one of them. \n\nTaken in the High Sierra of Bejar in Spain.
