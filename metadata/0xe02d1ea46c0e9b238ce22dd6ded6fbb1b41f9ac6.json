    "description": "Meet Bitty \n\nBitty got his \"ticker\" by being the smallest puppy of them all. He may be tiny, but he has the biggest heart. He looks at you for approval with every move he makes. \n\nColoring: He is blue with white markings.\nPredicted Adult Weight: 20lbs\n \nIdeal Forever Home: Bitty is on the submissive side. Meaning he will be an excellent addition to any family with or without additional animals in the household. He needs guidance and seeks approval, so his human should ideally be someone that would benefit from an emotional support animal, as Bitty is extremely in tune with human emotions. He is a true definition of a lap dog and sweet and calm companion.",
