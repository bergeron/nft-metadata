    "description": "In this piece I was striving to capture the essence of the human experience in times of crisis and uncertaity. It is a surreal and abstract depiction of a woman giving birth to herself, surrounded by mass devastation and panic that is taking the world by storm. The woman's birth is a symbol of life and rebirth, a reminder that even in the face of destruction and despair, there is always the potential for something new and beautiful to emerge.\n\nMixed media art.\nâ€”â€”\nðŸ–¼ 4500x5626\nâ€”â€”\n2 0 2 3",
