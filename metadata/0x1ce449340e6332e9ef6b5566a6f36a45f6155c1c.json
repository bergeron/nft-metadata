    "description": "Orina is the Angel of Peace. \n\nA girl abandoned in the Ukrainian war. The only things she has are her older brother's Hoodie and a Teddy Bear. She has yellow hairs and light blue dress as in Ukrainian flag. The hoodie, protecting Orina, is colored in blue and white as in Russian flag but without red. A symbol of peaceful and civilized Russia. Yet there is no one to protect her she is strong enough to be a protector of the Teddy Bear herself. And this strength reveals her power. \n\nShe is holding a symbol of Peace in her hand. And The paper origami Wings are spread behind her. Orina's power protects her and everyone struggling in the war conflicts with a Shield Field. \n\nUkrainian name Orina comes from a Greek goddess of Peace - Eirene.",
