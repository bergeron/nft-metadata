    "description": "Cycles of nature are marked by the changing of seasons, the flowing of tides, and the growth and decay of flowers. In this digital version of ‘Reconnecting’, flowers blossom from saplings to full blooms, and finally, they disintegrate back into the earth to make way for new life.\n\nThis digital art is a testament to the circle of life and death; as earth nourishes us, we nourish back, so death becomes nourishment. Mother Earth is a cycle, and the feminine power of nature is manifested through this circle.\n\nEdition 1/1\nArtwork by Hana Shahnavaz\n2022",
