    "description": "Sunday’s are for family.\n\n“domingo” was shot on a Sunday afternoon at Chapultepec Park, Mexico City. It’s the representation of the importance of the day in the Mexican culture; a fun, family centered 24 hours. It is common to hear about “el domingo familiar”, while growing up, there was no more important plan than to be with the family, liked it or not. \n\nOn the other hand Sunday’s, for the longest time, were a dread for me. While living apart from my northern-based family, the now common loneliness hit harder on that specific day, creating mixed feelings for that last day of the week. \n\nThis collection was shot in 2017 on Ilford 3200 film.
