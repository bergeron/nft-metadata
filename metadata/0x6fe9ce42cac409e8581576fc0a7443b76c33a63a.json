    "name": "Burry Port Beach",
    "description": "Nestled on the Loughor estuary in Carmarthenshire sits the town of Burry Port. The beach there is a massive expanse of sand that easily dwarfs many in Wales. Located nearby is Pembrey Sands, another large beach but flatter and used for military landings. In 1928 Amelia Earhart landed here after, as a female aviator ,she successfully flew solo across the Atlantic Ocean.\nThis image was taken on a day where the conditions dictated the output, that being monochrome. Along the beach on the day I arrived, a natural S bend had been made with the different sand heights that interacted with the natural water path of fresh water coming off the land. \n\nThis is natures art on the beach at it's finest in monochrome.",
