    "description": "The Meta Comedy club is an exciting experiment that is making two worlds collide—comedy and blockchain technology. We are not simply launching another NFT project, but pioneering how businesses are built on the blockchain, along with community ownership. We aim to create a fun and profitable environment for our members, while driving real innovation in comedy and entertainment. Also, we’re providing new mechanisms for the next generation of comedians to become recognised for their work and contributions, as well as developing a virtual comedy space for professional and industry partners alike",
