    "description": "Just because she was of royal bloodline, she couldn't let anyone tell her how to live. So she listened to that rebellious side of herself that she couldn't resist and rejected the noble blood in her veins. Although her family turned their backs on her, she had became the Lady Liberta of all the Martians and had promised herself that one day she would liberate all the Martian people. In the light of this dream, she embarked on a spiritual journey, which embraced her, to gather all her power and return to her planet.",
