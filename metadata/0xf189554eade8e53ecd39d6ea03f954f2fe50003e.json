    "description": "I took this photograph in the village of Karabash, close to the heavy industry center of Cheliabinsk, in the Ural region of Russia, which the UN has marked as one of the most polluted spots in the world in its environmental pollution reports. The toxic fumes from the chimneys of unfiltered copper factories and the pouring acid rains had filled the waters of the artificial pond in Karabash with heavy metals. The pond, which was the only entertainment for the children of the poor village, was actually as dangerous as a time bomb.",
