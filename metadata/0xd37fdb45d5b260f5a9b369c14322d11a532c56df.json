    "description": "The dark part of the picture is like a reflection of the past. The light part is the future, where you have to take a step away from the door before you can enter. The door, on the other hand, shows fear - and it reaches out to open the doorknob and take you away. The shadow of the doggie is hyperbolised on purpose - the further away from the light the greater the fear - that is our shadow side. The floor is a reflection of pure consciousness, because every day we make choices - what comes next. The red carpet speaks for itself - 'you have to run' - and the important thing is to notice this red signal, indicating that it's time to \nchange.\n\n",
