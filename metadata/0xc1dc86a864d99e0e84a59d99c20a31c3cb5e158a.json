    "description": "I often think back to my childhood and the two really tall slides in our local park. They were huge, the size of a house, or maybe two!\n\nTo scale the steps to the top was an achievement in itself, the fear of falling as you climbed up was immense. Once the steps were done the frightening slide down was next. The whole experience was full of fear, perhaps that was half the appeal. \n\nThe slides have since been demolished, they'd surely never allow such dangerous things these days. Were they really as tall as I remember them or was I just a small human. I'll never know. But the fear remains in my memories. \n\nDigital paint and collage/photo manipulation. ",
