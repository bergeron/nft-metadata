    "description": "Emergency training in Wesel, northern Germany. The\nauthorities simulated a situation where a bus collided with a train containing toxic gases.\n\nIn 2016 the German authorities released a statement that recommends all German citizens to store food and water for at least 10 days. Terror attacks in Europe have created a feeling of general insecurity and the war in Eastern Europe is fueling anxiety in the population. The fear of war and terror is growing, although according to the Global Terror Database, the number of terrorist attacks in Europe has been in decline since the 70â€™s. \n\nWith this background we have been researching on how people get ready for any kind of crisis or catastrophes. The so called preppers stash food, some built shelters, others are getting weapons. We traveled through Germany and photographed exercises and facilities that serve to protect the population. Sometimes private and government measures go hand in hand.",
