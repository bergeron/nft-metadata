    "description": "Hades and Persephone, an outwardly complicated tale, their story has been told in variations. From kidnapping, sorrow, and love. I believe their story is left to one’s imagination. In my collection, I bring to life the love story between Hades and Persephone. Persephone’s infinite cycle of arrival and departure to the underworld and the immortal ruling of Hades. This is Hades and Persephone.",
