    "description": "# Chill City Penguins\n\nThe Chill City Penguins hail from deep within the arctic regions of the Metaverse!  Every citizen of this ARCTOPOLIS is a unique, randomly generated NFT. Whether biz and tech-birds working downtown, penguin hipsters of  ‘CICLE PARK, or commuters driving in from CHILLSHIRE suburbs, these birds got style.   \nIllustrated by comic artist Josh Blaylock, inspired by a world of penguin characters he’s been drawing forever, including the comics Penguin Bros. and Igloo Barbecue.\n\nDimensions:  2499 x 2499 px. Created on the Ethereum blockchain.   \n\nRights: NFT owners may reproduce one-off units of prints, t-shirts, or other merchandise for personal use, featuring their Chill City penguin, unchanged, with or without background (not for mass production). **Chill City and the Chill City Penguins are © & ™ 2021 Josh Blaylock, All Rights Reserved.**",
