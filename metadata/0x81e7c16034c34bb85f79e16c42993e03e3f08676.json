    "description": "Not just a Man, \n\nThere will come a day that we realise that all that is hidden under the surface, The pain, The Scares, The regret is just trapped by our own selves.\nThe past has gone and cannot be changed, Regret serves no purpose other than to remind us of the times past.\nScares disappear and heal if we let them.\nDeep down we all know this yet we hang on to the above like a addict!\nForgive my ramblings for i am just a MAN"
