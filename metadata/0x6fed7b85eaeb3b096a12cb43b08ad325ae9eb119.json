    "description": "All ballerinas have such an elegance about them moving gracefully, along the stage and really do dance like angles floating on clouds. It was both an honour and a privilege, to have worked with Olivia from, The Royal Ballet of London and equally the street artist Jim Vision.\n\nJim Vision is well known British graffiti artist and muralist based in London best known for his participation in the Save the Bee project. Jimâ€™s unique style has earned him recognition not only in his native country but also around the world. His mural, Wings, was created on a wall in Shoreditch, London as a memory to his late grandmother.",
