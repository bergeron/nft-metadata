    "description": "This piece is an absolute favorite of mine. I think it's because the lines and composition aren't created by light and shadow, as usual, but by the layering of the spatial elements. The perspective is so unique that it almost creates visual confusion about the actual space and how these layers are formed. This creates an abstract, almost surreal artwork. And the unique tiles with their particular coloring do the rest.",
