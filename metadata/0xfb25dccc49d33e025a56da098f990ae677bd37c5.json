    "description": "I took this photo in Paris in February 2013. The poster of the movie, which was originally called \"Bullet to the Head\", spread throughout the city. The poster on the back of a bus caught my attention. It was as if Sylvester Stallone was really shooting at passers-by. I observed for a while and looked for a suitable angle. I took this photo after a long effort.\n\nThis humorous photo sometimes reminds me of a serious matter; armament in the world! I wish guns like in this photo were only used in art. But every year, hundreds of thousands of people lose their lives in gun-related incidents around the world. Sometimes this happens in wars, sometimes in conflicts, and sometimes by accidental bullets. In the world we live in, people can die while walking on the street with the gun of someone they don't know. How treasured! I dream of a world where guns don't cause deaths.\n\nPhoto by: Emre Bostanoglu\nDate: 19/02/2013\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 4046 × 2240\nLocation: Paris\n",
