    "description": "This piece features my brother, Andre, and some of our closest friends in Miami. We were celebrating birthdays on a yacht. The colors of Miami inspire me and are in sync with my vision. Miami has become our new home, and we are thriving. This is the next chapter in our journey as creators and entrepreneurs. We have created our success, and have earned the right to leisure and wellbeing. This is an ode to our team, a visual toast to the future.",
