    "description": "This world is like an illusion, the realm of oblivion. We wear masks here, live by someone else 's rules, live by expectations, disappointments.. We've forgotten who we are.. Oblivion breeds sorrow. Sometimes, something real and alive fleetingly awakens when that part of us that is not from this world speaks to us.. And then oblivion again..",
