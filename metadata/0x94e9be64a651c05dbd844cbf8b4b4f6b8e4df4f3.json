I was woken up by a photographer friend informing me we had an Elk or \"Wapiti\" in our campground. Photographers from the campsite over were taking photographs and had the elk's attention. When I emerged from my van, the elk was facing the other group and I found myself about 20 yards away, creating this unusual view with from my 300mm lens. \n\nThe winner of this auction will receive a 24\" by 36\" canvas print. This is the only copy that's ever been printed and has been sitting above my fireplace for the last 5 years.",
