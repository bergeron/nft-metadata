    "description": "“You yourself will always be the worst enemy you can encounter; you yourself lie in wait for yourself in caves and forests.”  \n\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", Friedrich Nietzsche.  \nMore often than not, what stands in our way is our own fear. Our fear arises from our thoughts, our thoughts arise from our desires, our desires rise and fall based on our understanding of the world, and our understanding changes through contact with reality.  \n",
