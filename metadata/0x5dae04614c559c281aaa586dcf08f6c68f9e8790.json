    "description": "The tree of life is rooted on a piece of land and hands, like a special external force, ensure its safety.\nAn open cage on a tree is a symbol of freedom and flight. With gaining freedom, the path begins along the stairs to the top of the tree, to its free flight, development. But this path is not easy, as there are many branches, many forks, many obstacles.\n\nArt is the result of my life experience associated with overcoming difficulties and limitations on the way to free creativity.\n\nArt created in oil on canvas in 2022.",
