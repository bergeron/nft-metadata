    "description": "One of the aspects I love the most\nabout this collection is the quiet, calm breeze when flying my drone. There's something about finding lines within our world, and the simple directions that they can lead us. \n\nWhen I flew above this store, I remember the stories of myself on top of this store when I was a teenager, young and wreckless, simple minded but yet still a story teller. Wanting to know more about the world and the space we all live in. ",
