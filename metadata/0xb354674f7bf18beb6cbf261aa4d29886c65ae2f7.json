    "description": "Alpha Pass-ion Genesis owners get the right of free mint at all our projects, right of  airdrops and right of voting at DAO. \nAlpha Pass-ion has its own creative team and compared to other Alpha teams we create all of our projects within our team. Best advantage of this you can get the right to win free mint instead of WL from all of the projects. \nAccording to the project details minimum 2 projects are presented per month. If you are Genesis owner you have the right of word on the projects. What does that mean? You will be able to determine type of the category of the project ( 2D, 3D, animation, pixel etc), which blockchain will be preferred etc. \nAlpha is you and this is your alpha.",
