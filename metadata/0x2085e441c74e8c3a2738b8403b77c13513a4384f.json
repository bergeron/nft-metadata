    "description": "After two years of Coronavirus pandemic, the schools have just reopened, and I was very excited to see these children coming back from school. They themselves were happy and smiling, as if life had returned to this dead city. Seeing these beautiful red pomegranates along with children's joy created an indescribable scene for me.",
