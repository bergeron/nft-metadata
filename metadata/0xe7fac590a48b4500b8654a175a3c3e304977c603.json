    "description": "You're wearing a white shirt, sipping your coffee. You get distracted for a moment and a drop of coffee drips from your cup on your shirt. \n\nYou know how that feels. It's like the image you see when you drop a coffee-soaked cup on the tablecloth.\n\n The combination of coffee with fabric or paper is not always the result of setbacks. Now, a concept called coffee art has become a rapidly rising fashion in the world.\n\nNowadays, coffee is not only drunk, it is also used as an indispensable part of art work. All the aromas that the seed took from the soil emerged one by one. \n\nThe flavors left on your palate while drinking are a surprise! Black mulberry, chocolate, vanilla, lemon... Understanding and discovering what you drink with every sip is just as enjoyable.",
