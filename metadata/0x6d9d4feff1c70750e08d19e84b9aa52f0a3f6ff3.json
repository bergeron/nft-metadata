    "description": "The world we know and the other, as yet unknown, parallel... But which is the real one? I deal with these and many other questions in my works, which I now present as a unique NFT. Our world presented as a true reflection of reality and paralleled as an inversion of color, once known as a photographic negative. Sometimes it is the relationship and action of colors perceived as a heat map, other times as a black and white image. The model for all the things I offer is a real oil painting on canvas. Each piece is a unique 1 of 1, so you don't have to worry about rarity. You own a rare work of art, nothing like it and will never be created again. You can print it or use it as a profile picture.",
