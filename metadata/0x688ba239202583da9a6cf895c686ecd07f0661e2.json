    "description": "Hello friends. This is picture 1, if you buy it, you will get the unique piece, the original, sent by post from me. This kind of pictures are exactly my style and unmistakably me. In making the original image, I was daydreaming about the universe and our future. I try to reproduce my imagination and my thoughts with paint and canvas. I beg you, what does this picture say? Let it affect you and follow your own associations. One theme is transhumanism and the expansion in the universe. Kind regards, yours Sebastian Becker Weimar (NFT-Beckus86-NFT)",
