    "description": "In the burst of life that is spring, there are multiple creatures that live in different dimensions as Blossom Spirits. They are powerful and cyclical expressions of nature in material and etheric realities.\nThis piece connects me with the experience of being an animal breathing in an exchange with visible and invisible existences that make me feel the immensity of being awake.\n\nThis is a 1/1 digital drawing done by hand over a manipulated photograph I took a few years ago. The piece was completed in February 2022.\n\n9449 x 7087 pixels\n.jpg\n\n",
