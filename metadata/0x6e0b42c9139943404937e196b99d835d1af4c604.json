    "description": "As an artist, I have always been drawn to the power of visual storytelling. Through my work, I aim to create images that challenge the viewer's perceptions and encourage them to think deeply about the world around them. I have a diverse background in traditional mediums, such as Photography, 3D and graphic design. Still, when I discovered the world of AI art, I felt liberated from these mediums' constraints. In The Great Freeze, I am creating an imaginary event where everything got covered in snow. The collection explores how a photography documentation of this event around the world could look like. My goal is to harness the power of AI to tell stories that inspire, provoke, and engage the viewer on a deep level. With AI, I can create images that push the boundaries of what is possible, exploring new concepts and compositions that would be impossible to achieve through traditional means.\n\n\n\n Year: 2023\n\nEdition: NFT 1 of 1\n\nCopyright: © 2023 Antti Karppinen.
