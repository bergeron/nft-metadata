    "description": "windows 7 is the latest piece in a series of abstract works based on the Microsoft graphical user interface of the same name. I take my own previous artworks, extrude the images into a third dimension then stretch and warp them into new forms. These forms are layered over each other like windows. \n\nThe windows series comes from the idea that screen objects are not separate from the material world, because they have materiality in their code. The dichotomy between the physical and digital is a false one. Computers represent material reality in new ways and we see differently as a result. Screens displaying these objects are simply a different kind of window.",
