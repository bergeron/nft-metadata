    "description": "Being from a smaller city in the Midwest, Iâ€™ve always found big cities very intriguing. There is this sense of organized chaos with everything moving at such a fast pace. Everyone is so focused on what they are doing and how busy they are, that they rarely take the time to look at their surroundings and appreciate the beauty that is civilization.\n\nAs I stood in a high-rise building looking down at everything happening on Michigan Avenue, I was able to appreciate the city with an entirely new perspective. Everyone and everything felt so surreal. I saw this man, who was dressed professionally, walking down the street. I found myself wondering, who is this person? Where are they going? What is their story? \n\nHaving this view of bustling Chicago made me realize how small we truly are when compared to the scale of a large city, let alone the world as a whole. \n\n\n",
