    "description": "“Shilling is a marketing tactic used to promote NFTs. Common characteristics of shilling include posting about your NFT on social media constantly, sharing links to it, and mentioning it whenever possible. Shilling is often viewed as a spammy way to market your NFT.”\n\n- NFTing\n\n1/3 of the collection \"I'm Buying! Shill Your Art Below!\" \n\n\"SHILL:: 1\"  invites the viewer to consider the complexities of the art world and the challenges that artists face in a fast-paced, technology-driven landscape. The artwork provides a commentary on the shill culture that is widespread in the NFT art space, and emphasizes the mental fatigue that artists can face when trying to promote their work in an overly saturated marketplace while constantly competing for recognition.\n\nThe title of the artwork, \"SHILL:: 1,\" derives its meaning from Ai art generation tools' ability to assign weight to certain words in prompts. In this case, the word \"SHILL\" has been given symbolic emphasis, implying its significance in the overall theme of the artwork.",
