    "description": "\"BLOND:ISH LIFE IS\" Drops Tues April 11 \n\n8pm CEST / 2pm EST / 11am PST  on Sound.xyz.\n\nEach NFT will be reedemable for 1 copy of the world's first biodegradable vinyl made of bacteria. Its really about owning a part of history.  DROP details on http://life-is.blondish.world/\n\nBack story. This is a track I made before my trip to Antartica, was feeling inspired by being in nature away from humans :)\n\nI'm super passionate about making the music industry single use plastic free, and when we met Evolution Music, a collective who is also as passionate as us to make the music industry more sustainable, well...... we had a crazyyyy dream!\n\n\"HOW THE F*** do we create a plastic free vinyl that sounds good?\"\n\nSo here we are 4 years later, and nature to the rescue as usual :) \n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Does it Sound good? \n\nA Yes! Innovating a bio vinyl was actually not so hard, because nature can mimic other materials, but getting the actual sound of the record to portray its full spectrum like its plastic fossil fuel counterpart was the challenge, but WE DID IT!!! \n\nQ:  Does it need new machinery, or can this new material be used in existing vinyl pressing machinery? \n\nA: In addition to finding a plastic free material, one of the goals we wanted to figure out, is to actually come up with a product that can be mass adopted for actual change, otherwise it just becomes a novelty item. Yes, this PHA bacteria based material can be used with existing machinery. \n\nQ: When will the bio vinyl be ready to ship\n\nA: Summer 2023\n",
