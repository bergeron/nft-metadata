    "description": "2020 was a unique year in my career as a street photographer. After six months of strict curfews and stern Covid measures as well as vandalism and destruction caused by civil unrest,  New York City turned into a desolate shell of its former self. The once bustling metropolis started to look and feel like scenes from a post-apocalyptic movie. As I wandered through the empty streets, normalcy began to slip away. Over time, things slowly improved but it wasn’t until a cold and snowy night in December that the city felt alive again. \n\nThis photograph represents a city reborn and is a personal reminder of my experiences during darker times. Wandering the empty streets I no longer recognized while trying to remember what how things once were.",
