    "description": "Drifting in a daze, I am neither awake nor asleep.  The crisp, cold air compliments a sleeping bag immersed in frost.\n\nI’m completely alone…isolated…hypnotized. Without a tent, my view of the stars is unobstructed as the glacier calves…\n\nRocks begin to fall, and the light begins to change; the full moon rises as a deep, bitter cold mass continually flows from the west.\n\nThere’s an urgent rush to view the illuminated glacier behind me.  \n\nCerro Torre stands tall, glowing as it looms overhead…  \n… something abnormal is sensed.\n\nCountless days & attempts to capture this mystical mountain have led to now, this moment….the abnormal.\n\nTime seemingly then warps as night becomes blue hour…  \n…am I dreaming?  \n…or am I awake?\n\nAbove a sea of clouds, I feel as if I’m floating; the mountains revealing a character I’ve never seen before.  \n\nA pulsating mist slowly reveals more of the surroundings over time. I have never seen these mountains like this…  \n…are they breathing?  \n…or am I simply dreaming?\n\nAnd in this darkness, I can only stare at the lagoon and my surroundings; pondering if I’m awake, or simply dreaming…\n\nAnd only then, I realize the truth. I’m neither dreaming, sleeping, nor awake…  \n…I am actually alive.",
