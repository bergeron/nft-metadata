    "description": "The structures represent hope and liberty after World War 2. \nI believe there is a war inside of us between our logic and our emotions. We don't know when it has deeply affected us until we are waging war in our minds between the two.  \nI hope \"Sign Of Peace\" brings you to a place of tranquility for a moment, putting to rest the battle of opposing thoughts!\nThe mesmerizing structure 'Les Braves' is found on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France.  \nThis image was taken March 2022, while enjoying the scenery of the Normandy coast. ",
