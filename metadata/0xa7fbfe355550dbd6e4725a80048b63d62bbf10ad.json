    "description": "\"Montreal\" was a record I wrote at one of the lowest points in my life mentally and emotionally. I used this record to recap how ego, selfishness, narcissism, and lack of self awareness tarnished one of the most important relationships in my life. The record is completely transparent and touches on how I wished this relationship had come my way, later in a more mature segment of my life. I wanted this record to be the second release from the album strategically as a juxtaposition to my first release \"Count Bands\", where I used things like money, ego, and material things to mask insecurities and pain I was feeling. This is just another steep drop in this emotional rollercoaster of an album and opens up a different segment of my life to the world.      ",
