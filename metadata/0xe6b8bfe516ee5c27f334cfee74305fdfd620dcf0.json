    "description": "“Along with cave paintings, threads were among the earliest transmitters of meaning.”  -Anni Albers\n\n “Quilted One\" is from a unique collection of 1/1 digital images inspired by my grandmothers' and great grandmothers' quilts and quilting scraps hand-stitched from early 20th century flour sacks and cut from worn out clothing. Some of the textiles are more than 100 years old. \n\nOver the years, I've collected bundles of these items. Painstakingly photographed, scanned, composed, and digitally manipulated sections from quilts and scraps, I've added my own marks to continue the history. Returning my foremothers' art to life with technology—analog meets digital. \n\nThis image holds memories of the past—family, identity, thrift, creativity, skill, love, and longing—and melds them with our present moment to bring together generations of artful women.",
