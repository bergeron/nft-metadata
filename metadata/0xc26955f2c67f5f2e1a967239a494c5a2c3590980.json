    "description": "I have a habit of waking up early. Earlier than most at times. One morning I found myself in an empty downtown Los Angeles. The streets were silent as I explored this vast and eerie version of the bustling city I am normally use to. Off in the distance I saw someone walking across the street. With my Leica MP and a unique thambar lens I made this photograph. Using Cinestill 800t film stock I pushed it to 6400. In my mind I envisioned a surreal image to match what I felt this morning. The texture of the film makes the photo feel like it is on a canvas. The unique thambar softened everything up to what I saw in my mind as I made this picture. This photograph demonstrates a capable artistry we all have with photography. My lens was the brush and the film stock was my canvas indeed. Visually translating a physical feeling through photography.",
