    "description": "CAR CRASH GAME\n\nIn the Circus Republic, even tragedies are turned into play. \n\nCar Crash Game thus becomes the playful representation of an improbable theatrical performance, where even a head-on collision between two cars manages to take on grotesque and amusing tones.\n\nA freak show that draws from the goliardic spirit of old circuses like Barnum's, where even the human oddities generated by the whims of nature - which in my case I randomly generated thanks to the whims of the AI - such as the 3 Legged Man Jonathan Redaviv, the hypertrichotic Lion Man or the Lilliputian General Tom Thumb, in the Circus Republic would have been elevated to national heroes.",
