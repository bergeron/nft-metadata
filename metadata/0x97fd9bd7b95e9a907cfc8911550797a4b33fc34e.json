    "description": "From \"Waking Suburbia\" - 1/1 NFT by Austin J Schofield\n\nPictured is a woman watering the plants she has scattered along the sidewalk in front of her home. Gentle light illuminates the pictured woman as she leans over the sidewalk to reach the underside of one such plant. Within this small pocket of light, we see the blue of her shirt outshine the blue of the sky, and the texture in her creased skirt stand out against the softness of the surrounding details. \n\nAt a first glance, we see a quiet storyline, one devoid of any complication, resting in a web of everyday life. It is only after scanning this pocket of light, the one in which she stands and waters, that we realize its properties differ from the rest of the scene. The picture is not about the day we are observing - it is specifically about the day that she is experiencing. ",
