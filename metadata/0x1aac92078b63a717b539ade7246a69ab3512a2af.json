    "description": "This is the legend about an unusual love story. A ballerina who just wanted to take a look at the sea fell in love with the Pacific Ocean, and with its waves he made music for her to dance. Some say that late night instead of the tree,  they see a ballerina dancing into the ocean, until they see her no more. With the sunrise, the old tree log is seen again in its eternal dance pose.",
