    "description": "We donâ€™t fall, we overcome bridges by keep moving & finding new ways if necessary. That is life. There are no mistakes in life, but mere experiences & knowledge we acquire to move through the infinitely abundant cycle of life. That is how this story begins of a place far out near a star called Vega on a planet known by its light and life full of inhabitants as Vasuvia. The Vasuvians are a peaceful, loving & respectful culture. Little did they know that there are others in the multiverse who bid to differ in opinion because of the insecurities they possess & the hunger of power and dominance they mean to possess. On one side were the Vasuvians, who were proud of their faith in hospitality and oneness while on the other side were the beings of the planet Ruzaka from the Rizoro Star System whose prime focus was to expand their colonization across the multiverse. Hence, their decision comes into being to invade Vasuvia. ",
