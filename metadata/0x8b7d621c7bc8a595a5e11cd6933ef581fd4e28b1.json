    "description": "Concept art for V.0 PHUNKY (SOCKS FOR PHUNKS) inspired by Unisocks Edition 0 created by Uniswap designed by Callil and Leander Capuozzo.\n\nSocks for two left feet. Notice the arrangement of the toes on each sock.\n\nPhunk is Punk\nCryptoPhunks (;Phunks) is a Non-Fungible Token (;NFT) collection on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was created in June 2021 by a group of anonymous developers. \nIn July 2021, after receiving DMCA served by LarvaLabs for copyright infringement, biggest NFT trading platform OpenSea censored and banned the collection from their platform for the third and final time. Shortly after, original developers compiled Open Letter to LarvaLabs and left the project since.\nIn a Spirit of web3 culture a renegade group of community builders took it upon themselves to create their own Phunk marketplace called NotLarvaLabs and open-source the code.\n\"By owning a CryptoPhunk, you will forever commemorate this ongoing fight against centralisation.\" - from CryptoPhunks Manifesto.",
