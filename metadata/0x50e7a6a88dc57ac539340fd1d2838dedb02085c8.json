    "description": "We are all witches. We are all glitches.\n\nWITCH GLITCH is a 3D dance piece created by mixing the language of dance with animation techniques and 3D simulation.\n\nWith WITCH GLITCH I keep asking: how to dance in Web 3.0? How to choreograph in the metaverse? How to reprocess the revolution brought about by the relationship between dance and 3D simulation? As a dance artist, I seek creative answers to these questions by articulating dance and 3D, NFTs, web3 and metaverses, provoking a dialogue between the classic and the contemporary and reflecting on the future of Art and Dance. Other bodies, other movements, other dances.\n\nArtist: Diego Mac\nDuration: 1â€™34\nMusic: Force Dance (Szegvari | CC0)\nMP4 | 1920x1080\nCollector receives high quality version.",
