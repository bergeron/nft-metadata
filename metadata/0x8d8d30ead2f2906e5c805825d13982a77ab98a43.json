    "description": "The smile was spontaneous and heartfelt. I might've only just clicked her smile, but the warmth of it still lingered. \nEverything around Fort Kochi (A city in India ) on that  day was festive. Joy filled celebration!\n\"Holi\", a festival of colors, was widely celebrated in Northern India, but the South didn't miss bringing the essence of it here. People from all the other continents and culture came to partake in the festivity. \nColors, people, talks; everywhere, everyone bathed in enthusiasm â€¦\n Among all the beautiful moments I stored in my camera film on that day, this girl's spirited smile remained to be remembered.\n I told myself I must take photographs because I must retell this ebbing human emotions around me.\n\nEDITION - 1/1\n\n",
