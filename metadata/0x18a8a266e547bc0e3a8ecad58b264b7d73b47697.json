    "description": "Coward only to losing a loved one , no amount of strength nor experience with pain can change that . \nespecially when you are an overthinker with a photographic memory , you can see them even when your eyes are closed . as a child my way to deal with death was to bind a star with every soul I lost , I stopped at the point where I ran out of stars and the sky was not clear enough to watch them twinkle ..\n",
