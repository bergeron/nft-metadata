    "description": "In a world increasingly dominated by the corporate, the Medici are a relic of an era where business was personal. They understood that in order to succeed, they had to be willing to take risks and make sacrifices. They were also aware that this might result in their public face being perceived differently from their private one.\n\nThe three faces of Medici is an attempt at creating an object that embodies this dichotomy. It is a triptych depicting portraits in Renaissance style combined with post-modern expressionistic techniques. It is a merge of old and new, deconstructing the old. The triptych evokes the three faces of the Medici: their public face as patrons of art and culture, their private face as ruthless businessmen and politicians, and their secret face that is hidden from history.",
