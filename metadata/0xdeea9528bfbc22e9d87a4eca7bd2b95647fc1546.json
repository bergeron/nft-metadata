    "name": "Narcissus",
    "description": "Narcissus was a very beautiful young man, and many fell in love with him. However, he only showed them disdain and contempt.\none day, while he was hunting in the woods, Echo spotted him and immediately fell for him. Echo tried to hug him. However, he pushed her off and told her not to disturb him.\nEcho, in despair, roamed around the woods for the rest of her life, and wilted away until all it remained of her was an echo sound.\nNemesis, the goddess of retribution and revenge, learned what had happened and decided to punish Narcissus for his behaviour.\n She led him to a pool; there, the man saw his reflection in the water and fell in love with it. Although he did not realise in the beginning that it was just a reflection, when he understood it, he fell in despair that his love could not materialiseand committed suicide.\n According to legend, he turned into the flower that bears his name, th narcissus.\npoet by ovid.",
