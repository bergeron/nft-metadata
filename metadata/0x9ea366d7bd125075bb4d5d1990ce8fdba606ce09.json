    "description": "Built to be experienced in the Metaverse on [Spatial.io](https://spatial.io), the Peace Pavilion is set in the heart of a vast, golden Ukrainian wheat field and under a gentle blue sky. Ukrainian 3D artist Max Sheika invites us into a compelling story of turning pain into power as he honors his family still in Ukraine, those who fled, and all who have been affected & uprooted by unjust conflict. \n\nThe large floor-to-ceiling windows give you a 360-degree boundless view out to the horizon as soothing sounds of birds and moving water fill the air, giving the Pavilion a feeling of tranquility and calmness. \n\n\"Inside the pavilion, you will find a portal in the ceiling, a portal to a peaceful sky where no fighter jets fly, where no rockets are whistling. There are no explosions, no roaring sounds of tanks,\" Sheika expresses. \"Just a peaceful blue sky, a dream of every Ukrainian, of every human being.\" \n\nAll primary sales and secondary royalties from this space will be split between Max and the official Ukraine government's cryptocurrency wallet, all in support of the people of Ukraine. Join us in this moment of history.\n\n\nDesigned by [Max Sheika](https://www.maxsheika.com/) and [Polycount](https://instagram.com/polycount.io/), 2022.",
