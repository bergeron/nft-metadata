    "description": "MechaMiniX and Cryptobengz come together in the first-ever Singapore [SG] NFT community collaboration to present two extraordinary NFT Art pieces. A one-of-one collaboration between the insane minds of two NFT brands that are distinct yet fused with an unexpected art piece.\n\nWe presentsâ€“ Anti CryptoBengz CryptoBengz Club [ACCC] MechaBengz. We are a club where we are different from the Web2.0 world, thus, born a human with a half bengz and a half mecha identity. A one-of-a-kind artifact influenced profoundly by our local culture and unique core identity. Finally, the fiery aura is a homage to the legendary Aurabengz.\n\nYou will own one of the first local NFT art piece collabs that may well be written in your kid's NFT history book in the future.",
