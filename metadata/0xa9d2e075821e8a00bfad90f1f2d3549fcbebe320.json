    "description": "I am a woman,  I am a mother Of course you know that by observing my physical features, but there's more to my essence than meets the eye. I am full of strength and wonder. Many people wonder at how I am strong enough to contribute to the workforce in my community while nursing the kids, many wonder at how I'm able to handle many things at once with deep wisdom and flexibility, many wonder how I support and hold the fort situation of life, yet I handle the expectations.  Many marvel at how much pain and abuse is meted out to me by men and even fellow women sometimes, yet my back never breaks.\n\nI marvel at how much beauty and strength the Creator has invested in me. This is why I celebrate myself. I won't be afraid of telling my stories and fighting for the things I hold dear and the well-being of the people I support, because I know there's much to my essence than meets the eye, I am a mother.
