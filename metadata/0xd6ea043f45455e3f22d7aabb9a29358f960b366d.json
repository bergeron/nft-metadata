    "description": "MY ART TRIBUTE is my new art project. The idea is to draw and reproduce with real color pencils artworks that were created by famous artists, both traditional and digital.\n\nEach drawing is made on real paper, size 21x30cm, and then I take a photo of the work which is minted here.\n\nThis work is drawing #5 paying tribute to TAKASHI MURAKAMI.\n\nThe first buyer of the NFT will receive the original work on paper. \nYou can communicate with me on my Twitter for that.\n\nMy fellow artists in the digital space ask me a lot about Art history because they know I have been a traditional painter for the past 20 years. I want to pay tribute to all the great masters that have enlightened my life. They all have made me the artist I am today.\n\nHere you will find no AIRDROPS, no DISCORD, no METAVERS, only color pencils on paper.\n\nIt’s a work in progress….",
