    "description": "Future with CryptoLIFE or DEATH  \nby Nadiia Forkosh\n\nLife Death & Cryptoart No. 4\n\nThe symbolic form of crypto evolution and traditional monetary system. \n\nCrypto technology started (as symbol) it's life existence as a primitive plant under the water and now it has started to shape its own intelligence world. The green and red veins built the face of the alive intelligent creature with the crypto as the part of life cycle, where there exists blood, body, natural freedom and possibility for each human. All the creature needs for normal life. The opposite side is a dead fixed world without crypto technology (inflexible with lifeless coins in the dead mouth of skull). These are two parts of our future (in the world where we will exist in the close future). \n\nPS: The Ethereum sign location is in the eye (water pond where life began), this eye place symbolizes intelligence.  On other hand the place of the coin in the mouth is a symbolic form of immense constant consumption without the possibility to feel and see the future.",
