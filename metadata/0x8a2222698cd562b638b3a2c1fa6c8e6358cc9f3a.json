    "name": "16th Century Cosplayer",
    "description": "Having successfully returned home, to the 16th Century, after many years away time-traveling, the nobleman now wanted to have his portrait taken. \n\nWhen asked by the painter if he wanted to be featured with something that reminded him of his great adventures, he looked at one of the objects he had brought with him, a curious head piece from the 21st Century, and took it. “Paint me wearing this, as a sign of admiration for the culture from that era”, he said. \n\nAnd that’s how the portrait of a nobleman cosplayer was painted.",
