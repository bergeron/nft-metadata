    "description": "This collection is a subset of my \"Lifeguard Towers\" series on Opensea, focusing on the 30+ towers on Miami Beach. I wanted to create a catalog of sorts making studies of each tower. To have them stand out, they were photographed with no people, using similar framing and long exposures to produce minimal sky and sea backdrops. In this methodical way, the photographs highlight the tower's bright colors and eccentric shapes revealing their unique personalities and bringing them to life.\n\nAwards for \"Lifeguard Towers\":\n• Prix de la Photographie (Architecture Photographer of the Year)\n• FAPA (Bronze in Architecture)\n• ND Awards (Bronze in Architecture)",
