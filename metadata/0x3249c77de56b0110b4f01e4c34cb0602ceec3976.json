    "description": "The artwork shows the sync between nature and humans, how they are all connected, and its impact when they come together to play a harmony of re-birth.\n\n\"Itâ€™s going to rain soon,\nAs nature awakens\nWith the sound of Malhar.\nThe orchestra of wind,\nblowing through the trees,\nBuilds the whisper of nature itself.\"\n",
