    "description": "«I woke up and saw the laid out leaves on the floor like trophies. They were all washed and dried. Sasha walked in the rain at night. It was autumn and the trees slowly began to undress. He collected the leaves to photograph them. In the morning I was getting ready for work and I wanted to get out when Sasha said: I want to take pictures, but it seems to me that by the evening the leaves will not be so beautiful. I undressed and the process began. I was late for work that day and was very happy.»\n\nfrom diary (2021) project. film photography",
