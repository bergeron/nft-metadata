    "description": "People often dream of a past, believing that it's impossible to bring back this past glory, singing its praises, while there's a future behind them with countless possibilities to surpass it in other ways, but they are too absorbed in what had already been to see what they really could do.\nSometimes history is a mistake and people are bound to repeat it until they realize this vicious circle and start anew their own story.\nRemember, past is a previous stage of your evolution, don't try to recreate it, leave it behind, it's keeping you down from flying high.\nPrehistoric fish that crawled out onto the surface would have died if it continued trying to swim. \nAdapt.\nPast exists to learn from it, not to live it.",
