    "description": "Light Mirror I\n\nThe Light Mirror Series ponders double-slit light experiments, the mysterious behavior of light, and western epistemology. The viewer becomes light source, often casting a shadow or separating a subject's light onto the background. A proposition that reality is generated and participatory inasmuch as it is perceived. The political philosophies and epistemology of our failing societies cannot withstand observations of modern physics, nor are they prepared to provide spiritual navigation as systems fail.\n\nThe 1/1 pieces in this series contain mixed media: oil painting, photography, AI generated elements, digital painting, and post glitch. Each tool and technique is utilized with integrity to liberate the soul, remind myself and the viewer of our infinite and luminous nature, affirm life, and connect with what I love. ",
