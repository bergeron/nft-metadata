    "description": "Spirits I is the first of a series of nine 3d sculptural pieces. Each piece of artwork is an idol(sculptural pieces in African traditional religions). These pieces hold the history and spirit of its people, black people. African traditional religions normally believe these idols are a form of bridge to the spirit world. They believe various forms of spirits inhabit these idols. In view of this they pray to these idols to guide, protect and help them in times of need. I made these purely from imagination. I believe I am a modern day idol maker. These pieces of art exist both in the spiritual plane and the digital plane.",
