    "description": "This is a part of a series of still lives that considered the idea of computers making art by dreaming about themselves. This particular piece is reminiscent of the work of Gustav Clint, and I call it, the \"Golden Dream\"\n\nThis work is by Patrick Lichty, Pioneer New Media Artist who is interested in the realities we make with technology.  His work has been seen in the Venice and Whitney Biennials as part fo the Collective RTMark, and his work is in collections like the Spalter Collection, British Computer Art Society, Verostko Center for Digital art, and Boca Raton Museum of Art.",
