    "description": "THE WAY OF WATER\nThe shot I wanted here is to convey the scarcity and importance of water in our life as we may take it for granted. \nIn the frame, you can see a girl from a tribal village named Bayyakkapeta, located in Telangana, India gathering water from a pit and collecting them in the vessel. This is the daily activity of the girl and women in their village who walk kilometres to gather drinking water. \n\nI captured this image on 16th September 2022 at 7:30 am IST on my Sony Alpha 7R iii, with a 35mm lens. \n\nArtist: Arun Kumar Nalimela\nAchievements: NFTYDREAMS Photo Contest Winner 2nd\nTheme: Water\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 6681 × 4456\n\nLicence: As long as the creator is credited, the primary NFT holder can use the NFT in advertising, to display privately and in groups, and to create virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays.
