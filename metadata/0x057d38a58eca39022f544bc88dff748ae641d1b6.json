    "description": "\"I've been out of college.\" is an abstract generative watercolor painting created with Python and a pen plotter (Axidraw). The painting instruction (a vector image) is created with a generative algorithm.  The painting is physically rendered with a plotter. While the algorithm can produce countless designs, due to the nature of plotters and watermedia, this is a unique piece that cannot be replicated even with the same painting instruction. \n\nIt is a 35.6 x 25.4 cm (14 x 10 inch) painting on 300 gsm watercolor paper. The paper size is 40.6 x 30.5 cm (16 x 12 inches). It was painted in 2021 with a customized extra-fine watercolor brush, using assorted ink, watercolor, and liquid pigments. The first owner of the NFT can claim the physical painting. The artwork was signed on the front. The NFT and the physical painting can continue to be traded separately.",
