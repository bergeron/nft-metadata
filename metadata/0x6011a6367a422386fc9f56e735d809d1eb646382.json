    "description": "This collection is named after a cyberpunk novel called the wind-up girl. It's a very foreboding tale of what we should not do as a society in the future. \n\nBecause this is because I intend to donate a percentage of every sale to anti-domestic violence and human trafficking causes with proof, so by collecting one of these NFTs you not only get a fantastic piece of art but you were helping empower people to get away from their abusers.\n\nIn the book the wind-up girl “the new people”  they are not human and while they are strange and beautiful creatures, they are engineered beings,  programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of businessmen, but like so many others of her kind, she's abandoned to the streets. Regarded as soulless beings by some, and devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near dystopian future.",
