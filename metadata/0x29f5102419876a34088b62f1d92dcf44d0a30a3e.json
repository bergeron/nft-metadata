    "description": "This collection is about desires. Desires that come by the impulse of our body, compensating for the eternal hunger of our mind in search of eternal road.\n\n“I often wonder about the hours when a man sits alone, watching the smoke a cigarette, thinking. I wonder what great things have come from those hours. When a man thinks, there is a spot of fire alive in his mind - and it is only proper that he should have the burning point of a cigarette as his one expression.” Ayn Rand.\n\nShot on 35mm film.",
