    "description": "If you read this letter, it means you already have My Idealism Works, and I want you to know that I'm so glad you have my work. In this first work, why did I choose destiny? I want at the beginning to set goals, namely my destiny and I know that my destiny and yours are different right? Here I illustrate the ways, “Decide” when you clash with two choices, “Plead” when you feel narrowly jostled by other humans who want to go towards their destiny too, a “Blessing” where there is a God factor that helps you achieve and bestows the destiny that you want specifically just for you. That's what I feel too!!!\n\nFor me, the destiny that I want to achieve is \nCreate Our Own Legacy that really belongs to us, you and me, thank you very much for helping the destiny that I set at the beginning and hopefully everyone of us can create our own legacy.\n\nBest regards, Tugeng_artwork",
