    "description": "‘Solitary’ has been my all-time-favourite piece amongst all my artworks. I saw this sea turtle when I was scuba diving in Ishigaki in 2018. I had never felt such calm and free ambience under the water. The turtle was simply enjoying being alone, swimming along very slowly. I first captured this magical experience with mixed media on the panel, yet I added a little fish for the turtle. The little fish was an analogy of my dog ‘Brie’. Recently, animation and sound were added according to the memory when I encountered the turtle, as my first ever NFT.",
