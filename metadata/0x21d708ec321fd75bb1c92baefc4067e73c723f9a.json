    "description": "Humor vs violence\n\nJust smile, joy, happiness and humor can help us to keep going and don't give up when the world is turning hard. The clowns and satirists have contributed to the creation of this free world by breaking taboos and keeping an open mind. \n\nThis collection is inspired by Chris Rock's correct and non-violent reaction to a violent act, and it's designed to remind us that tact, comedy, and intelligence reduce violence a lot, so maybe we should all work on increasing our capacity to deal with jokes.\n\nMore than ever before, we realize the world needs people who are still in touch with their childhood and who like to give a smile to others, as clowns did for centuries before Hollywood monopolized them with terrifying movies.\n\nPlease support us to be able to create more anti-violence art which is one of our world's most important issues.\n",
