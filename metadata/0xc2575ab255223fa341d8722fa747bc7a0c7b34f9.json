    "description": "I am a prolific artist using AI and digital art methods in conjunction to create new art - underlining \"new art\". I believe that this technology gives all artists the speed and confidence to push their limits, and I for one intend to!\n\nThis is a Hieronymous Bosch-inspired art I made, named \"A Quiet Place in the Jungle\". It represents the distractions and static we have in our lives, in the form of jungle animals and stuff... and the quest - the longing - to find a quiet, secluded place in all the mess.\n\nThe image is quite large and detailed: 10800x7333 px. Enjoy!",
