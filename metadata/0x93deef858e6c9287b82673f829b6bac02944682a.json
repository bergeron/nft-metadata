    "name": "Giant Otter (Brazilian)",
    "description": "This is a smart and strong predator, much larger than almost all other representatives of Mustelidae. Their size ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 meters. Perfectly adapted to a land-aquatic lifestyle. They have short hair, they recognize each other by a spot on the chest (everyone has a different shape). Giant otters live in large family groups of 5-8 individuals. It lives in the Amazonian rainforests in sluggishly flowing and overflowing rivers, streams and lakes. They breed very poorly in captivity. In the 70s, they were on the verge of extinction, they were hunted because of their fur and because they caught a lot of fish. Currently, there are about 4-5 thousand individuals of the giant otter left in the world, and its numbers continue to fall. After the sale of 8 NFTs from this collection, 30% will go to help animals or a nature reserve with the help of WWF.",
