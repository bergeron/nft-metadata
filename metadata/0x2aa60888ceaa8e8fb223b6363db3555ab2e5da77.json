    "description": "Yu do things. They live in our same days but, in a parallel universe. They worship the swoosh as a deity.\n\nWaro's inspiration comes from the great metropolises, like New York and Milan. The energy found in these large cities motivates him. It is where chaos reigns in a suspended harmony. In essence, lines cross and intersect, levels overlap and become dimensional, and it is always varied, yet there are constant elements that populate the surface, creating calm chaos.\n\n",
