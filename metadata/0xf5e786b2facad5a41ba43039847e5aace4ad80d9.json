Many minds gathered, great ideas were born, but nothing happened*. Nobody moved. Nobody threw a stone. Some fell down**. Commoners watched the scene but were very careful not to participate in it. It was awesome!\n\n*Mlibty Shadows have no ears, so can't hear one another\n**Mlibty Shadows have no legs and arms, they fall easily. Others can't help them to stand up again, because they have no legs, no arms and no ears.",
