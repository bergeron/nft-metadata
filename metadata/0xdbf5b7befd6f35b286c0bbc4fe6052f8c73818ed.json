She thought for a moment, then frowned.  \nThere was only one thought on her mind: \nWhy would Collins write to her about self love when he makes her feel alive?\n\nHe wrote her a two sentence note:\n\nDear Amore,\n\nTry to be nicer to yourself,  \nBe kind to yourself.\n\nLove,  \nCollins\n\nIn that moment, her heart fluttered a bit. She was caught off guard by the thought of she not finding happiness in herself but in him alone.",
