    "name": "A Happy Place - Northern Lights Ketchikan Alaska",
    "description": "The Northern Lights are always a magical moment to witness, being in Alaska when it's not raining and the sun goes down early in the evening you can see the lights most of the time. Then when you get a nice solar storm you get amazing shows of different colors. \n\nSometimes during a solar storm me and a fellow photographer will drive down old logging roads and up the mounains outside the town. This vantage point is higher in elevation, where you get a nice sky view and you can see the fog down in the valley below.\n\nI will always be amazed and excited to photography the Aurora's and am really lucky to live in a place where I can experience this amazing event regularly.",
