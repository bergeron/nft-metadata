    "description": "Whosoever thou art! Out in the evening roam,\nOut from thy room thou know'st in every part,\nAnd far in the dim distance leave thy home,\nWhosoever thou art.\n\nLift thine eyes which lingering see\nThe shadows on the foot-worn threshold fall,\nLift thine eyes slowly to the great dark tree\nThat stands against heaven, solitary, tall,\nAnd thou hast visioned Life, its meanings rise\nLike words that in the silence clearer grow;\nAs they unfold before thy will to know\nGently withdraw thine eyes â€”\n\n - Rainer Maria Rilke",
