    "description": "This is the first Mushroom NFT by ozimaster.\n\nMid autumn is mushroom picking season in Europe. This activity is very popular in Poland. Lots of people, families with kids, individuals go to local forests for mushroom picking. Some of them are poisonous and can be very dangerous in extreme occasions may cause death so you need to be very careful and sure what you take from the forest. Mushrooms are being cleaned and cooked or dried. They are tasty addition to sauce, meet, dumpling (pierogi z kapustÄ… i grzybami), bigos and lots of other polish dishes.\n\nI like picking mushroom culture. Its brilliant occasion for communing with nature, to calm down and stay away from every day noise. 2019 autumn season I spent mostly not on picking but mushroom hunting. With my DSLR camera. I managed to take couple of interesting shots of mushrooms which were base to my editing project. Initial post-production started in Lightroom, and Photoshop where I focused to make night style and light effect so the mushroom looks like taken directly from mysterious, magical kingdom of gnomes. Than it was edited in Glitch and Adobe Photoshop Mix to give this strong digital context mix.\n\nBelow are details read from original photo exif metadata:\n\nArtist: MICHAL OZMINA \nBits per sample: 8,8,8\nContrast: Normal\nCopyright: ozimaster\nDate: 2019-09-28 14:49:49\nDate digitized: 2019-09-28 14:49:49\nOriginal date: 2019-09-28 14:49:49\nDigital zoom: 1.0\nExposure bias: 0/6\nExposure mode: Manual\nExposure program: Manual\nExposure time: 0.008 sec.\nFlash: Off\nFocal length: 200/10\n35mm focal length: 30\nF-number: 4.8\nGain control: None\nImage width: 6000\nImage length: 4000\nCamera make: NIKON CORPORATION\nCamera model: NIKON D5500\nCamera maker note: Nikon\nLens max aperture: 16/10\nMetering mode: Spot\nOrientation: Normal\nPhotographic sensitivity: 100\nPhotometric interpretation: RGB\nPlanar configuration: Chunky\nSamples per pixel: 3\nSaturation: Normal\nScene capture type: Portrait\nSensor type: One chip\nSharpness: Normal\nSoftware: Ver.1.02 \nUser comment: INSTA: @michalozmina\nWhite balance: Auto\nX resolution: 300/1 in.\nY resolution: 300/1 in.\n\n",
