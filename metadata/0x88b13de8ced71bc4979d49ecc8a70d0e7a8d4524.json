    "description": "Some viewers develop a deep illusion of intimacy, friendship and identification after many hours watching a streamer. Over time, the audience learns details of the streamer and their life that are commonly shared with closer friends. This veneer of intimacy can reenforce the attraction that viewer feels and the relationship progresses. This has led to some popular streamers employing security details after audience members begun stalking and violently confronting them in person. \n\nOften viewers attach meaning to spending extreme amounts of money on their favorite persona. They believe this transaction makes them stand out or entitles them to attention.\n\nExamples can be found of viewers who have convinced themselves they are married to their favorite persona.\n\nViewers vehemently defend or attack the persona causing conflict that has lead to an otherwise ordinary person on the internet to navigate life in a way only the Beatles or the Pope can fully understand. \n\n2307 x 4096px\n248 frames",
