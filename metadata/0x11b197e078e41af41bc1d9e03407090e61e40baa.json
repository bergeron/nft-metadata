    "description": "“Explorer” recreates a scene from the movie “Blade Runner 2049” in which the main character embarks on a process of searching for the truth to find out if he is a real being or a man-made artificial intelligence.\nIn this case, the scene created by me presents this character in total darkness, where everything is visible thanks to the light emanating from the ETH symbol which is a radiating source of energy. And the storyline of this scene gains new meaning as it is a quest for the understanding of the ETH blockchain as the ultimate truth, as a kind of creative source of life, as a kind of light of hope, and at the same time of uncertainty.\nIt is an ambiguous scene where we cannot be sure whether we are in the presence of the beginning or the end of a journey.\n",
