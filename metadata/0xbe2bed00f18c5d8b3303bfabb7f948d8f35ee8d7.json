    "description": "When I am taking photos, my girl usually spends her time reading. Like someone going to the playground with their kid. In this case I was the kid playing with my camera. The sun was slowly setting and she had no idea that I was photographing her and not the sunset. After I got my shots I sat down next to her an we enjoyed the last sunrays together.\n\nLocation: Tenerife, Spain  \n\nYear: 2021\n\n 1/1",
