    "description": "Prophet Enaia, the one who bequeathed a sacred power. She speaks of the past, present and forthcoming events. Allowing her to witness the fall and creation of all mighty things. Though she speaks in a slow manner, one must be ready to accept any answers given by her.\n\nThis immense of a power that she has, triggers the fear from people around her. Thus, she blamed often for her prophecies. Despite the circumstances, she remains calm and neutral. Embraces her power not for the good nor bad.",
