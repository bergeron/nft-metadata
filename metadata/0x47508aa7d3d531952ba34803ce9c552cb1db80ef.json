    "description": "Acrylic on canvas (130 x 110 cm) by Martinho Dias. MARTINHO DIAS was born in Covelas, Trofa, in 1968, where he lives and works. In 1996 he finished his degree in Plastic Arts - Pai nting, by the Faculty of Fine Arts of Porto. Exhibits since 1995, having held to date several solo and group exhibitions. Touching on irony, cynicism, or paradox, the excellent technical mastery of Martinho Dias' work transports us beyond the painting itself, to legitimate and different experiential realities, as well as to a world in transit, even if involuntarily.",
