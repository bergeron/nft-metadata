    "description": "Homo Papyrus is a choreographic-visual essay on the hybridization of the human body with the botanical body. In a world where life is vertiginously threatened, it remains for art to imagine what are the forms that result from the union between organisms in their efforts to survive. A plant-body. A body-antenna. The history of humanity written on the body. The botanical writing on flesh, bone and leaf. Homo Papyrus. Piece created by mixing dance language with 3D simulation and animation techniques.\n\nDance and 3D: Diego Mac\nMP4 | 1920x1080\nPorto Alegre | Brasil\nCollector will receive a high quality version",
