    "description": "“As they’re dripped in gold and dazzled with diamonds, Leo is the definition of royalty.”\n\nThe angel of Leo was the second piece that I created in the ‘Psalms of Celestials’ series, that I began shooting in 2019. I wanted this piece to express not only how the world views Leo, but how Leo views themselves. A sign that is not afraid to embrace their royal status, they’re vivacious, theatrical, and passionate. However, above all, they’re natural leaders and dedicate their life to their friends and lovers. \n\n“These lions are ruled by the sun, a star that never goes into retrograde, and likewise, these lions are renowned for their stability, loyalty, and consistency.”\n\nI wanted to not only show that black men are strong and powerful human beings, but I also wanted to express that there was once a time that black men and women were seen as kings and queens. \nImage size: 9537 x 8075\n",
