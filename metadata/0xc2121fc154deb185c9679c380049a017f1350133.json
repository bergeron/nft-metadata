    "description": "This photo was shot during a trip to the city of Fuji, Shizuoka, Japan. Fuji is located 30km away from Mt.Fuji and you can see this iconic mountain from almost anywhere in the city.\n\nAs I walked around the city, I ran into this spot. With its peak covered with clouds like dry ice, Mt.Fuji looked both heavenly and infernal. The stairway was a starting point of your adventure.\n\n2569x3211\nSony a7siii",
