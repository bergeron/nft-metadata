    "description": "Mao is one of the Gods that rules the Astradelics in the world of Astradelia. Mao is known as the Daffodil God, the God of Balance, and the God of Rabbits. Mao's sweet gaze and fragrant scent captivating all hearts as she walks gracefully in the juncture of honour with her fluffy and sweet purring familiar spirits levitating around the great applause of respects. Admired by many, walking so brightly like an embodiment of daffodils in winter and spring, cheerfully greeting all people with a polite and dazzling smile. Mao preserves her beloved people with grace using both of her Sensu, elegantly wielding through the air as she exerts her power from the stone of her magical Sea blue luminescing like a bright star attached on her hair adornment.\n\n\n\n2039 x 3360",
