    "description": "This visual is from the \"Goddess Portal\" series, a collection of images documenting live liquid paintings projected directly onto Muses. The analog technique was created by Metagasm to make visible a cosmic spectrum of her Musesâ€™ primal creative electricity.\nColorful transparent liquids are cast directly onto the model with a vintage overhead projector and photographed through prismatic lenses. No filters or digital modification is used in creating the images. \nThe muse and collaborator pictured, Natasha Phoenix King (@bendybombshell) is a renowned contortionist, shapeshifter, and performance artist who has appeared in commercial campaigns such as Yeezy, broadway stages, the pages of vogue, and on film and TV in the TODAY show, Law & Order, etc.",
