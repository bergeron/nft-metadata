    "description": "Once when I was walking near a lake in Guatemala I found myself surrounded by a kaleidoscope of butterflies, thats the official collective name for a group of butterflies and after this experience I can see why. There were literally thousands of them all around me, it was truly magical. This experience inspired the scene for this piece which explores the fantasy worlds that children allow their imaginations to take them away to, a child's playful jump and longing to fly.  \nWatching my children grow I have been taken back to my own childhood and have remembered how immersed in my own fantasies I could become. When playing \"Make Believe\", children aren't just pretending, for that moment they are fully immersed in their own make believe idea. This piece allows us to step into their world, to fly away there with them.",
