    "description": "Beauty comes in many forms. \n\nThe light of the sun illuminates a rare, elegant tornado as it dances across the field, full of life and wonder. \n\nCaptured on my Nikon D800 near Ashby, Minnesota on July 8th, 2021.\n\nCollection Description: \nArt of The Storm\n\nThe sky is a blank canvas for the most powerful art of Mother Nature. Storms are majestic and beautiful while also ominous and destructive. They are the ultimate representation of the Yin & Yang, the balance between light & dark. We can never tame Mother Nature, we can only bear witness to her strength and her beauty.\n\nThis is a collection of some of my fine art style storm photographs from 20 years of documenting severe weather.\n\n10% donated to \"Girls Who Chase\" initiative. Empowering & inspiring women & girls to pursue the weather, the sciences, and their passions.",
