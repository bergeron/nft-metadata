    "description": "The photo was taken in the camp by a reindeer herder who lives the same way their ancestors lived hundreds of years ago, in the middle of the tundra in small tents (called \"chum\") covered with reindeer skins. For hundreds of kilometers around, there is nothing but endless expanses of snow and piercing cold.\n\nCamera: Fujifilm X-T4\nLens: XF 10-24 f/4.0\nSize: 6240 Ã— 4160 px\nISO 3200 | 12mm | f 4.5 | 30 sec\n\nCommercial license. So feel free to use this photo for print, display and promotion.\n\nAbout Elena Liseykina: I started photography over 15 years ago. I travel through deserted and hard-to-reach places. And I try to show things and plots that most people do not notice. My goal is to show that in every moment there is something unique, kind and unique. I am Fujifilm and Skylumambassador. Winner of international competitions.\n\n\n\n",
