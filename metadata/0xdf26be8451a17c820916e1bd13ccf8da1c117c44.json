    "description": "I wasn't. \n\nI wasn't first to the internet, I wasn't first to social media, I wasn't first to crypto. I wasn't first to so many life changing events.  \n\nWhy? Probably because I wanted things to get social acceptance and then join the cause. Not any more. \n\nBut. I was early enough. Early enough to see thing grow, develop. Early enough to learn enough. \n\nI am a misfit. And I know that. And I grew to like it. \n\nTL:DR This is my first Eth mining rig back in 2017. I still remember the constant humming of fans that dispersed the heat in my loft on hot summer nights and even hotter days. \n\nWhat did I do with my yield? Ofc I sold it to buy new camera equipment.\n\nIf one day I will shine in glory on my photography journey that will be the first OG image that marks it. \n\nMaybe some day it will one of those historical shots. Maybe it won't, but no matter what I am giving it away in a form of an NFT for the lowest possible starting bid. \n\nMaybe that will be you starting out as a great collector. ",
