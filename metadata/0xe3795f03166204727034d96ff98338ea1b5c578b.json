    "description": "Meet Tess - an amazing woman who endured domestic abuse as a teen. Her experiences are often disregarded and minimized due to the age it happened at and she has since had to grapple with the effects of both the abuse she suffered and the treatment of others. Now, Tess's story is one of hope and courage; she has moved through that period of her life and found a way to love & be loved.\n\nViolence against women has no place in our world,\nEverything within us must stand and be heard.\nActions that harm must be stopped in their tracks,\nCourage and justice will not turn back.\nWe are powerful and strong together,\nOur voices rising up to storm any weather.\nIt's time to stand our ground and fight,\nTo break free of this wrong with all our might.\nOur voice so united can never be ignored,\nAs we rise up together an army of kindred souls accorded.\nWe can shape the future of justice anew,\nAll rallying together we will break through.",
