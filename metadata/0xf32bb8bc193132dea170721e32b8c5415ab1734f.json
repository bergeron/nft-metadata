    "description": "The Metatron's Cube is the symbol of Archangel Metatron, the angel of life who watches over the flow of energy in creation and provides a connection to the divine source. \n\nMy fascination for geometry instantly drew me to this mystical cube which is said to contain all the shapes and patterns that exist in the universe including all of the Platonic solids.\n\nIt contains 13 circles held together by straight lines from the midpoint of each circle. The central circle is surrounded by six circles, forming a flower-like shape, and another set of six circles extending from it.\n\nEvery piece I create in the Mind Diver series bears significance to this piece through the Metatron's Cube as I evolve in my journey to express my true self through my stories like never before.\n\n3100 X 3160 px\nDigital painting\nHand-drawn on the iPad using Procreate",
