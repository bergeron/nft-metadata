    "description": "I got the opportunity to write a song for sync to potentially be placed in a Marvel movie. I heard the reference track and thought I could do better, but couldn't do it alone.\n\nSo I tapped in Oceantied to help produce and this song was created. We got it finished over a weekend while I was fasting for Ramadan. Despite how quick this came together, it's one of the more fun songs I've written and worked on.\n\nWe then got help from Moises to help generate the visual for the cover. \n\nHaven't really had the opportunity to release the song, so thought this was a great way to do it :) - Enjoy the first song I've ever written in Urdu/Hindi!",
