    "description": "This song came from a conversation that MIKE SUMMERS and I had about what we want to create when working on our album. Our whole idea was just about being as open and honest as possible. So that’s why 5’9 is basically a here and now type of record, where I tell you very plainly exactly who I am in this moment in time and how I feel.\nWritten by Curci\nProduced by MIKE SUMMERS\nMixed and Mastered by Jordan Criddle",
