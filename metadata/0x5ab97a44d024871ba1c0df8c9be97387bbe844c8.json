    "description": "The project takes its inspiration from The Double Screen, a book on the role of the traditional Eastern screen seen in Classical Chinese paintings by the acclaimed art historian Wu Hung of the University of Chicago, and explores an alternative understanding of spacetime. It is a portal, a node, through which the creative minds of artists can connect."
