    "description": "KCS is a teenage bedroom-based non-profit foundation composed of hackers, eco-activists, poets, and billionaire philanthropists whose initiative is to safeguard culture via meme-based non-art computer images. Web 3.0's community and social farming features need a sarcastic and metaphorical approach to critique our mishaps, which is what KCS is mostly about. It's possible that the new concept of cyber security might be elevated on the level of social infrastructure, where we need contents that are not an only shitposting craft but also references to the playfully artistic visual vernacular of an already cheesy sociopolitical alchemy.",
