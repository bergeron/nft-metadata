    "description": "Do you often get lost in time? You disappear into some event so that you do not notice what is happening around you. Your thoughts are immersed in some one thing and everything around you is just a background. Like, for example, a certain game that gets into your head and you dive into its virtual world, you forget about food, water, friends... You live in it. Only this game world fills your thoughts. You become blind and see only one thing, as if you will return to that brave new world where your avatar can do almost anything. You can love and hate her. But are you sure you need it? After all, there are so many interesting things in the world, you can find something for yourself that will hook you and pull you through a lot of exciting events in real life. Draw, sing, learn languages. You can do a lot, live. Go beyond the virtual world, enjoy and create your future.",
