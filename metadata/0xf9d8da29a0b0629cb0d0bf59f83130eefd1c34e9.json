    "description": "I always make photography as my healing therapy.\nSIMPE (meaning lonely in Sundanese)\nI like to be lonely and lonely, but sometimes there is sadness in my heart. Until on 5-5-2018 I went alone to give some privacy. More than 2,118 KM from home, sitting here alone, enjoying the silence of the morning waves. People said that I'm crazy, but I need it... Try to heal from 'simpe'.",
