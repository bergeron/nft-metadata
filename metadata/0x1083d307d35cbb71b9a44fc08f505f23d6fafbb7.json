    "description": "The Millenails Is a Generation with the most buying power than any other generation right now. They have very important decisions to make and have to deal with so many things that are wrong with the world today. One of them is billionaires. The reason we are kind of poking fun of billionaires is because they have a vested interest in keeping web3 from growing. We want to know why Bill Gates is really buying farm land. Like we care, but we donâ€™t care that much. What we do care about is Alpha and driving it to our NFT holders. The Millenials WTF offers several ways to generate alpha for our holders. We do so through various methods of managing risk and offering something special every 4 weeks for our community. We are Builders, Investors, NFT Lovers, Finance Experts, Brainy Devs, Arists, Fast Thinkers, with Mamba Mentality. Always. Invest in the Team, We Have No Shame In Saying That We Only Care About About Alpha With the Goal of Continually and Perpetually Raising The Floor.",
