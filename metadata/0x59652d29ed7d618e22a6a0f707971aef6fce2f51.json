    "description": "In my latest series of paintings compare the figure of the clown.\n\nThis idea was born from the exaggerations of the expressive and somatic features of the previously painted faces.\n\nMany of my visual sources do not present clown photos, they become so later, when the painting is almost finished, when the color of the make-up blends into the colors of the face.\n\nThis ambiguity between what is real and what is makeup allows me to highlight and expose an identity / otherness of what it represents.\n\nI alternate with portraits, paintings of figures painted in clownish clothes, in pairs or in solitude that symbolically express my emotions and my questions about life.\n\n",
