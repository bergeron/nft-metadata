    "description": "Now more than ever before, George Orwell's \"1984\" resonates with us. Writing the book in 1948, he somehow predicted a world filled with screens, fake news and paranoia. Having recently moved back home to Ireland after spending 10 years in the film industry in London, I found myself in lock down in a house in the countryside with my only overlooking neighbours being a field full of cows. Big Udder really was now watching me.",
