    "description": "Bored & Dangerous, almost a year in the making, is a historic moment for the NFT space. This work is the result of 3,000 members of Jenkins the Valet's “The Writer's Room” banding together to drive the creative direction of the work. Neil Strauss, a 10x NYT Bestseller, wrote the novel. All characters featured in the novel, in the illustrations, in the game of 'Where's Jenkins' and in the acknowledgements are owned by members of the community and licensed to Tally Labs. A special thank you to MBSJQ for creating such special artwork and for Murda Beatz who produced the beats you hear as the book rotates. This NFT may be burned for an Azur Root (a sacred item within Azurbala that can be redeemed for a PFP) or staked for membership in Hawthorn (a DAO dedicated to reimagining collective creativity). Visit www.jenkinsthevalet.com for more information and join us in creating future community-generative works.",
