    "name": "CYBORG DREAM",
    "description": "Cyborg Dream represents a dream made by a cyborg child who meets technology. The dualism in the coexistence of human and robotic elements is inspired by Japan, the design concept is taken from both ukiyo-e art and the cybernetic universe. In the project the circular shape indicates the repetitiveness of the time loops in which we live, taking up the principle of the Phi phenomenon (Ï†), which creates the illusion of movement due to the rapid succession of sequences. In the dream, the city is a transition process from the Edo period to the hyper-technology of the future. \nOriginal music by Vincenzo Salvia.",
