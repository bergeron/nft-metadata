    "description": "The aesthetic of ruins is the moment in which nature and time have left their mark forever. The collection was created using gilding and the unique pigment PbK11 - iron oxide, which provides granulation of paints to simulate rust. Time irrevocably modifies the forms, turning the ruins into ashes that are disappearing before our eyes today.",
