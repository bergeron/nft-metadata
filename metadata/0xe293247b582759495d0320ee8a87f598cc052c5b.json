    "description": "Part one of an ekphrastic AI poem cycle in 12 parts, inspired by the color theories of Bauhaus artist Johannes Itten as well as the 2022 arrival of an intelligent machine system that can see “millions of colors.”\n\nGenerative AI-powered text written by pioneering poet, artist, and AI researcher Sasha Stiles in collaboration with her AI alter ego, Technelegy – a custom text generator rooted in AI-powered large language models, which, for this project, Stiles has fine-tuned on examples from Itten’s The Art of Color and other research materials on Itten’s work.\n\nIn this work, ekphrastic generative visuals use words as paint to embody the poem’s meanings and metaphors, created by Stiles in p5.js. Colors and shapes refer directly back to Itten’s iconic masterwork, “Horizontal-Vertikal.”\n\nThe electronically enhanced spoken word poetry performance of the poem by Stiles, with original sound by music producer Kris Bones, is inspired and influenced by twelve-tone musicality manipulated via digital tools.\n\nPart of Stiles’ ongoing concept and series, REPETAE, which explores the relationship between poetic recursion and generative repetition.\n\n- [View High-Res Artwork on Arweave](https://arweave.net/veM1QbY4435zH7JkGhYxs8oSdikHTbJQY1H6-e_jMEE/1stiles-aeye-one.mp4)\n- [View License](https://arweave.net/zmc1WTspIhFyVY82bwfAIcIExLFH5lUcHHUN0wXg4W8/5)",
