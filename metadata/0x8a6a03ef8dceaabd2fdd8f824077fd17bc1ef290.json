    "description": "Birth, when life begins in a new environment.\n\nBorca is a morph of Bear and Orca. Grounded to move on land, swim free in the sea, and sometimes merged with an Eagle to fly. Borca can merge with many life forms and energy. Animal characteristics that are one with each other. Sometimes dispersed into individual forms, to different dimensions, always connected through space and time. Borca embodies friendship and family. \n\nYoborca is where the being(s) are with physical, mental and spiritual stillness and transformation.  \n\n1/1",
