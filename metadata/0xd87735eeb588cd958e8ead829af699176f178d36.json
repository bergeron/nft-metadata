    "description": "There is always something missing, a disappointed desire or a frustrated ambition, an unfulfilled dream.\nThe main theme of these works is the  vulnerability of people, an idea that I like to convey with portraits, which express feelings and moods well.\nI see my art as an exploration of the human soul. I go in search of lost truths, I aim to discover the most authentic inner voice of being, which guides the creation of the external world in which we live.\nThe ties that have linked human beings up to now tend to diminish if not disappear, hyperconnected but individually alone, we embrace consoling fictions.\nI try to break down the habitual view of things by achieving a certain degree of abstraction, and by aiming not at resemblance but at content. \nThe primary sale buyer will receive a limited edition glyc√©e print of the work below. Buyers of the secondary sale, will be able to request printing at a reduced cost, as regulated on the specific page on the website https://www.luro.it .\n",
