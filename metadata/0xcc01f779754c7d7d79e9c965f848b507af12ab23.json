    "description": "Depiction of women has been historically represented by an overwhelming majority of men, usually in some form of nude form. This trend of hyper-sexualisation of female bodies has been adopted by the current digital, gaming and NFT circles where female “eye candies” are becoming a staple for brands and pop culture to catch attention. \n\nThis short film explores a new side to the ethical metaverse, where women are represented by something else that is perceived as \"pretty\". This space is inhabited by humanoid creatures representing human form in more or less abstract shape, with customized stylisation and movements driven by the person represented by the avatar. To help fight unconscious and conscious bias, their avatars are abstracted to the core, often being classic “stick” figures. \n\nYour digital self is your own standard of pretty, this certainly does not need to be defined by your physical attributes, sex, nationality and whatever that is perceived as “normal”. \n",
