    "description": "2nd from the collection is \"Cute Little Girl\"\n\nThis vibe gives a smooth R&B Soul vibration that could be easily enjoyed in a cafe over a warm cup of coffee. This song tells a story of myself as a little girl going through trials and tribulations with my culture/religion. I always knew that I didn't want to do what everyone around me did. I became the black sheep of the family. This reflection helped me acknowledge my breakthrough from religion and family customs. Reliving those moments as a young girl made me realize more about myself, in that I'm constantly changing and not afraid to go against the grain.",
