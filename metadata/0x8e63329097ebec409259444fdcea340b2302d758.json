    "description": "Acrylic Painting on Canvas  \n20” Diameter  \nAugust 2020\n\nThis painting is part of a collection of paintings released September 3, 2022 called “Huemorous\", this painting  illuminates my effort to demonstrate comics as fine art.  Humor is often omitted from paintings, interior design and gallery curations.  Through my art practice I like to challenge the narrative of not just where humor belongs but what form it can take.\n\nThe purchase of this NFT includes the physical painting.",
