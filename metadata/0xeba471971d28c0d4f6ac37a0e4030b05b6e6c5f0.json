    "description": "Ài Huà (愛 畫) Collection explores the historical art of traditional Chinese figure painting by taking up the subject of the Chinese Courtesan. Sometimes misunderstood as prostitutes, Courtesans in ancient times were highly trained entertaining performers and masters of the arts. Often considered mental equals to aristocrats, scholars, government officials and all manner of high society Courtesans gained prominence in the literati arts, playing a formative role in shaping cultural ideals and were affiliated with extraordinary beauty and taste. \n\nThe title of this body of work, Ài Huà (愛 畫), is a play on words. ‘Ai’ reflects the generative art technology used to draw out these artworks, but here it has dual meaning as Chinese the character Ài 愛 means Love. Ài Huà (愛 畫) literally translates as \"Love Painting\" but can also suggest “a love for painting” or “paintings of love”. Entertainer, muse, lover and political influencer, with Ài Huà (愛 畫), the exquisite & fascinating world of the Chinese Courtesan brings to life sumptuous fashion, rich culture, power, vulnerability & incredible beauty.",
