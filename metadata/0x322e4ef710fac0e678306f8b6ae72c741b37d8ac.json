    "description": "Hey, Lead here. Please call me and my siblings the Post-Transition Metals. Just because we're not as hardcore as our cousins the Transition Metals, doesn't mean we're not as useful! We're just taking it easy y'know.. \nLead (/lɛd/) is a chemical element in the carbon group with symbol Pb (from Latin:plumbum) and atomic number 82. Lead is a soft, malleable and heavy post-transition metal. Metallic lead has a bluish-white color after being freshly cut, but it soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air.",
