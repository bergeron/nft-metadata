    "description": "As a 45-year-old Latina, I love the color. This NFT capsule was born as an experiment with fluid art. I had mixed feelings for this messy and non-controllable technique.  But I did my research and let myself go for days creating with different surfaces and materials. Once I had so many extraordinary pieces with vibrant colors and textures it made all sense to create unique pieces with the painted fabric.\n\nEach piece was cut and tailored individually, creating a unique capsule with a fluid presence, inspired in nature and every individual's beauty in this world. \n\nSigned by the artist.\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST \nMy name is Joyce Mac Cormack Barrientos, born and raised in El Salvador. In a Spanish-speaking country, pronouncing my name has always been an issue. And that is how Josh Cormack was born as an inside joke with my family, but I thought it was the perfect artistic name for my art. Never take yourself too seriously, learn to laugh about yourself, and simply have fun.\n",
