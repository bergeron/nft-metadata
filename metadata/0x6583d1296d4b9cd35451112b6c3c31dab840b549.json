    "description": "Dumbo, Brooklyn, New York City. 2017\n\nAs I roamed through the streets of Brooklyn, I arrived at Washington Street, arguably the most famous spot in all of Dumbo. It was a cold evening in February, so this popular tourist spot was a little less crowded than it usually is. I've shot the Manhattan Bridge so many times, but this time, I wanted to try something new. \n\nI took out my water bottle and poured some water onto the sidewalk, creating a puddle on the ground below me. This puddle made for the perfect reflection photograph, an image that has become one of my all time favorites.",
