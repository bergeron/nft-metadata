    "description": "“Inception” is the first installment of illkoncept’s Illusions series. This image was shot in Chicago, IL entirely in-camera by using the reflective glass bottom of a skybridge. Illusions is a series that provokes viewers to slow down, think outside the box, and question the way they look at things. All of us ultimately live in an illusion where our perspective determines our reality, and no two realities are the same. Using reflections of glass and puddles, this series creates candid optical illusions around urban settings that leave viewers questioning which direction is even right-side up.",
