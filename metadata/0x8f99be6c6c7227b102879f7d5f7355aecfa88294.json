    "description": "This is the first piece in my Serenity collection. \n\nThis was actually one of the first outputs that my algorithm created, it was the first palette and the first line type effect that I had. It's the very beginning of the journey and I really love this combination.\n\nIf you're the owner of this piece, you can reach out to me in Twitter and I will be happy to make any custom changes, rescale it or do whatever you'll need. I'm fully dedicated to my collectors and happy to support them as much as they support me",
