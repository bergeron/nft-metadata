    "description": "The earth is dying. We are slowly creeping past the point of no return where we have depleted resources. I’m scared for our children. Will they suffocate because of our decisions? Or can we change our course of action to leave the earth in a better state?\n\nWomen are the living embodiment of life itself. So is earth; The bearer of life. There’s a beautiful symbolism in a pregnant woman. The gas mask symbolizes the actions of both Mother Earth and the future of our species.\n\nBut fortunately, it’s not too late. We can remove the mask, and take a deep breath knowing we can leave the world in a better place.",
