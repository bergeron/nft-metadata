    "description": "Everything is Nothing, and Nothing is Everything.\n\nI believe everything in this universe is connected and maintains the Harmony of Life. The wings of butterflies get affected by the direction of the wind, the way the ocean plunges and drifts the sand into it, and the way light unites with the darkness.\n\nWe are all equal but different. We are all connected but boundless. We are all distinct yet indefinite. If we look beyond the differences of this illusionary world, we will see - A nurtured, kind, beautiful life. \nThat is Filled with waves of colours, dancing between everything and nothing- creating the perfect Harmony of Life.",
