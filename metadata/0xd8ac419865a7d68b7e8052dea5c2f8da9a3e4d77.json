    "description": "Our conceptual work Misery of a Point is based on a scenario where a point seeks the aesthetics and beauty of its own discontent in the creative process. When the point begins to flee with the artist's first move, it is already connected to the presence of other elements of the visual language, but it has no intention of immediately surrendering itself as well.",
