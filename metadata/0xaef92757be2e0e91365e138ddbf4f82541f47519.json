    "description": "Why do you go that far?\n\n*I've been told by quite a few people since we announced the 25%split after Ukraine charity.\n\nI don't remember the exact number, but I think it must have been at least 10 people.\n\nLook at the title. Here's the answer.\n\nFive months have passed and this idea has not changed. NO REASON.\nIt is very very easy to make up a plausible reason, but I don't want to big flag something I don't think.\n\n\nI made this NFT for myself.\nI will be looking at it over and over again until next March when I am done with split.\n\n\nI don't list it as I don't want to actively give it away myself, but I am open to offers.\nOf course, I am also setting up a split\n\nFinally, I would like to thank everyone for their help and support, although I will refrain from naming names individually.\n\nthx all!!\n\n【Character】HSG #00\n\n※　https://foundation.app/@kuraja/hsgplus/5\n\nI have declared that after this charity, 25% of the proceeds of FND will be split into Ukrainian wallets for one year.",
