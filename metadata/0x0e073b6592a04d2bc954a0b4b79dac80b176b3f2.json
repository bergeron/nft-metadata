    "name": "Abundance of Peacock",
    "description": "Peacock symbolism has great importance because it forces us to think about spirituality, freedom, self-expression, integrity, love, and pride. This symbolism can help us to do our best in this world. It also a symbol of immortality because the ancients believed it had flesh that did not decay after death. In a way this scene is a prequel showing how the peacock became immortal.",
