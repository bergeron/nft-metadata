    "name": "Mask of Tikar",
    "description": "This African mask from the Tikar people of Cameroon is hand-carved of wood and features finely detailed brass embellishment to the eyes and forehead. Tikar masks, with their ritual scarification and formalized hairstyles, are some of the most desirable in African art.\n\nMasks of this type are used during agricultural festivities, such as during harvest ceremonies. The basic concept of these rituals was the belief that the soil is sacred because it belonged to the ancestors. Therefore, once the harvest is good, there is great reason to celebrate and be grateful to them.\n",
