    "description": "\nSome of the oldest evidence for life on Earth comes from ancient chemical signatures and fossils in sedimentary rocks, which likely formed on the ocean floor about 4 billion years ago. There are hot springs, ponds of Mercury, rivers of Methane and Hydrogen Sulphide on the ocean floor contributing to the formation of Primordial soup. 60% of the human body is water which means we carry the sea within ourselves even after years of evolution.\nHere is an image of the Gannet colony in Muriwai Beach, overlooking the mighty Tasman Sea. These large birds return from Australia each year during the months of July and October to establish contact again with their lifelong mates in New Zealand.\n\nI am Manoj Kesavan, a New Zealand based Scientist & Photographer @ www.filmsutra.co.nz. I am an empirical enthusiast, always fascinated by the meaning of life.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, virtual galleries.
