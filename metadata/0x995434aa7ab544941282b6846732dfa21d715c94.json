    "description": "On Nov 7th, 2020, I was invited to talk on a panel with esteemed guests @m1guelpf, @StaniKulechov & @0xKofi.\n\nIt was NFTLDN ran by some amazing people, some of which evolved into the awesome @WeAreNFTUK\n\nThe subject: ‘The Future of Web3’\n\nAt that moment, my life changed forever.\n\nDuring that talk, I learned so much, but also felt I had a little to give.\n\nI tried to raise a bit of that passion deep within to talk of our future:\n\n- Of the power to do good.  \n- Of being excited AND afraid.  \n- Of building a better world.\n\nAnd I think it worked.\n\nIt was life changing.\n\nI knew I was onto something, and I knew there was no going back.\n\nPosting the video online it’s on 21k views and still going, and I hope it has helped a few people along the way.\n\nNow I wanted to share this speech with everyone, so mint, and join me, in this BRAVE NEW WORLD.  \n",
