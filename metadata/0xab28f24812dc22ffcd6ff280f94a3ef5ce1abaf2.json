    "description": "In the near future, as part of an experiment 10000 Apes on the Ethereum Blockchain were exposed a super-ape serum which transmogrified them into 6969 CHAD APES with super-ape capabilities. However, the experiment was not a 100% success, as 3031 Apes had an adverse reaction of the serum which turned them into vicious monsters. These monsters now roam the Ethereum blockchain and thus threatening the very existence of Ethereum blockchain if not found and treated on time.",
