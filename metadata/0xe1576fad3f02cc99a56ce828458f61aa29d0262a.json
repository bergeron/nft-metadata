    "description": "This NFT is my vision of acid snow, this scary beauty, which has been made of real snow picture taken by myself. I also compose the sound.\nAll of my artworks are done in \"Adobe Software Family\" and also \"Resolume Arena\".\n\nI was a dreamer in my childhood, from my mind to my vision. In darkness, I tried to see objects and even my parents’ faces in different ways so I could dream about it and make stories in my mind. I used to look at the ground and continue the footpath by widening and tightening my eyes. As child only I could see my vision, now with digital arts I can show you the way I prefer to see the world by playing with sounds and pictures. \nVisuals and sounds bring us an experience of a journey, in which every single of us can tell our own story. \nSo, let’s enjoy it!\nUse headset to have a better journey!\n\n",
