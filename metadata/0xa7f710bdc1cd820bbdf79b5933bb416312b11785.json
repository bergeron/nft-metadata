    "description": "As winter slowly releases its icy grip and the first warm advections of spring advance north over the still-frozen valley, fog envelopes the terrain. The recently thawed waters of the Hudson River aid in cooling the invading air, turning light haze into impenetrable walls of white. Though a regular seasonal occurrence, the fog never quite seems to settle the same way twice.\n\nThis shot, a crystal-clear memory in the obfuscating mist, is particularly special. The combination of elements created a surreal, almost mythical scene all too poetically punctuated by the lethargic, melancholy bellow of the fog horn and its reverberating echo that faded like light into the mist.  In the surrounding city, bagpipes blare and Step Dancers thunder as St. Patrickâ€™s Day festivities, much like the fog, lumber unapologetically on into the night.  It was a unique vibe.  A strange mix of opposites that for some reason was rather enjoyable.  Not unlike carrot cake.",
