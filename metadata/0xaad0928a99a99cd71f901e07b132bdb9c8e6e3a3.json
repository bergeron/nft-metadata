    "description": "\"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.\"\n\nNow more than ever, to merely believe in something is to fulfill its prophecy. Nowhere is this better exemplified than by the NFT, a machine that translates hype into concrete value via code.\n\nCrafted by a team of award-winning 2D, 3D, audio artists and creative coders, the Books of Ye is the latest social commentary from the makers of the Book of Yeezus. It explores the novel power dynamics of an era in which hype has become the preeminent currency: He who feeds the hypebeast is king.\n\nOwners of The Books of Ye assets enjoy a unique AR experience and private viewing room with an original soundtrack where they can interact with their asset and read a foreword elaborating on the concept.",
