    "description": "Caesar is an expression - note to self. At this paint in my life, I was swimming through a paradox of success & grief. In the months prior I had lost a lot yet gained so much. It was a cycle, I felt stuck & unable to process what was actually happening. I began to question everything around me - Why do I feel so empty? What’s the point of life if things get taken away? Why are we working so hard?  \n\nI had to change re-focus. I had to reflect. So I linked up with Fuzz, got in the booth & the words began to pour out of me. \n\nThe message behind Caesar is to be able to deal with life and stay true to your purpose no what happens. As things rise, they will fall. Caesar had many accomplishments & at the height of his reign it was all taken away, a similar feeling to what I was experiencing. But I realized my purposed hadn’t been fulfilled, I was still surround by love, there was still work to be done.",
