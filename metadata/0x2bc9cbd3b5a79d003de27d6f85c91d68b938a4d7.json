    "description": "«THE RED SPRING» — fear as it is. That’s how we remember this spring of 2022.\n\nThis artwork is my personal fear. I’m afraid of doing and NOT doing this even more. But I chose the first thing because I’m capable of it. \n\nI’m capable of helping those who has even greater fear than I do. I’m capable of minting this artwork and provide earnings from selling it to help those who suffered from the war in Ukraine. \n\nAnd you are capable of participating in this.\n\n#nowar",
