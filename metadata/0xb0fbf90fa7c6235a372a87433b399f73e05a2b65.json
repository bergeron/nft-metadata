    "description": "In the foundation of human life, menstruation marks the dawn of fertility which starts the whole reproduction cycle. Despite the importance it holds, it has been stigmatized by many communities. But in the middle of those, Odisha celebrates a three days festival of mensuration of mother earth known as “Raja”. During the festival for three days, women as symbols of mother earth spend their time relaxing and merrymaking. While not a single agricultural activity takes place during this time, giving mother earth her time to rest. \n\nThe current artwork symbolizes menstruating Mother earth, which is the origin of all the known life forms.\n\n\n",
