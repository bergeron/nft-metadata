    "name": "War between Realms",
    "description": "Legend says after the Shattering of the Black Glaive the seal of immortality broke on the Ethereal Plains by the old one named Agony, the veil to the Dark Realms was lifted and the horrors of purgatory entered the human realm. Shards of the Black Glaive were lost & a vicious war between realms began, which lured down the Lord of the 7 realms to the surface. The one who commands the Army of Demons, the immortal Lord Death. \n\nLord Hunters marched into the battlegrounds trampling over corpses that foretold their fate, with lives replaced by corpses and screams swallowed whole by hellhounds failing to battle through the everlasting nights.\n\nThey say that there will be one who will defy the Lord Demons for he shall be born by the Shard of the Black Glaive, He will find the shards of Black Glaive to command the Ancient dragon, confront Lord Death & end this curse forever. The God Hunter Vaegance.",
