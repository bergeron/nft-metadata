    "description": "It's rumored that when Steve Jobs heard the demo for this song, shortly before his untimely passing, he said it was his favorite song. He went to describe it as \"futuristic R&B with an ever-present air of nostalgia.\" Nice. Produced by the legendary Noah Beresin and Cloud Atrium, with slick vocals by Glassface, \"Whatever\" is likely to cause pregnancy. Listen at your own risk.",
