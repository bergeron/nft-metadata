    "description": "I think “non-fungible” represents life itself. \nLife’s value is inequivalent for everybody. \nNothing can compensate for it. \n\nArt productions mostly lose people who admit the value because they are regarded to be over their expiration date. \nI dare to choose the seasonal theme called Christmas. \nThe value of arts should not be subject to change by trend. \nEven one doesn’t have any precious feelings for a thing, other can have it for the same one. \nI wish that someone gives our art breath even after I disappear from this world. \nPeople might think it “fossil.” \nBut I just hope this art of us keeps on celebrating TODAY’s Christmas no matter how much time passes by us. \nMerry Christmas. \n\n----\n\nSize: 1920x1080\nFile: MP4\nSoftware: CLIP STUDIO PAINT EX, Live2D, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Audition\nLength: 1min\nProduction Period: 2021/11/05 - 2021/12/25\n\nVoice: Naoko\nTranslation: Ryoji",
