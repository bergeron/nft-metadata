    "description": "My work has always been a hybrid- somewhere between drawing and painting. My first love as an artist was pen and ink and as I developed my painting skills I started finding new ways to combine the two. For my first exhibition featuring Forget Me Nots Land I made some small works on paper. The goal of these drawings was to imagine how the plants of Forget Me Nots grow and their different stages of development. I felt that a few of the drawings were successful and interesting and I titled that series the Danger Series.\nDimensions 2316 x 3108 pixels 300DPI ",
