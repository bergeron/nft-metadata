    "description": "After years of highs, lows, and all the FOMO/FUD in between, the steady and sometimes clandestine force that continuously pushes progress forward in Web3 are the Builders. Those who believe in creating for their communities, whether if its for the Art, Utility, Brand IP, or love of the Game (or love of Games). Those who believe in CC0, trustless transactions, decentralization, anonymity, digital ownership, or this small spark we call the Metaverse. In the Bull they Build, in the Bear they Build. They will continue to Build and help shape the future of Web3. This is the PeanutGames Genesis Collection - For the Builders"
