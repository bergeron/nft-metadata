    "description": "Do you often look inside yourself, trying to explore specific aspects of yourself? How often do you ask yourself how exactly you feel at the moment? What emotions do you get when communicating with a particular person? Do you like your state of mind? How much do you value and respect your work? What can you bring to this world?\n\nNowadays, many are focused on external factors. Few look deeper, even if it concerns oneself. Often they are afraid or do not consider it necessary because we live in an age of beautiful but very superficial pictures.\n\nLearn to focus primarily on yourself and your feelings and not be uncomfortable with yourself. Ask questions, dig, and study because inside each of us is a huge and completely unique World!\n\nI believe that there is nothing beyond human control. However, our brain uses a meager percentage of itself, so why not try to test yourself to the maximum? And this maximum begins precisely with knowing yourself and respecting your individuality",
