    "description": "First to mint, second of its kind..\nThe first Linear Waze, you'll see in time..\n\nThis piece explores the possibilities of a continuous line where the stroke of the pen constantly searches for empty space. Notice where the line begins (bottom left corner) and where it ends (top right corner). The result is a city-like establishment formed in unity, connected by one.",
