With this piece, I searched to convey profound emotions, links, touches and affects between women with AI.\n\nThe relationships are enigmatic and ambiguous: sometimes they seem lovers, other times mothers and daughters, sisters or friends. But the affects are undoubtedly there. \n\nPiece made for the DEEP FAKE exhibition at Superchief, curated by Clownvamp.\n\nMusic: Bach - Book I: Prelude and Fugue No. 8 in E Flat Minor, BWV 853, Prelude by Carlos Gardels (CC0 1.0)\n\nBIO\nKika Nicolela is a Brazilian artist, filmmaker and curator based in Brussels.
