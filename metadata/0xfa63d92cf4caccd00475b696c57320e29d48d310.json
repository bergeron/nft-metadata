    "description": "“We dream the flight but we fear the height. To fly one needs to have the courage to face the void. The flight can only happen in the void. The void is the space for freedom, the absence of certainties. But that is what we fear: not having certainties. That is why we change the flight for cages. Cages are the place where certainties live.”\n\n— The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky",
