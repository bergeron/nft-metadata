Pass - is a limited DAO club membership that grants access to the aqueduct's facilities in the amount of 10,000 units. Pass allows you to earn by participating in the distribution of 10% commissions for all Fan Stakes made by the users for all the events (except for private p2p pools) on the platform. Moreover, Pass holders receive a distribution of 100% of the amount of treasure, if the correct Result has not been staked into the pool by any user. Pass owners can create their own events (p2p pools) and receive 50% of the platform commissions for them as well as for all the Fan Stakes made on them. Find out more: https://aqueduct.club/",
