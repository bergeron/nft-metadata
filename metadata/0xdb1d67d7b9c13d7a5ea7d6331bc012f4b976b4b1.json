    "description": "Part of a collection of correspondence between Mobysnail and Songlines that occurs in the 23rd century. From Barlow-62 space transport hub, Mobysnail is working on a space opera/novel on telekinetic snails that have achieved inter-galactic travel. But who is Songlines? And who is the little girl Cali that appears in his dreams?\n\nText:\n\nSonglines,| \n\nThe dreams come still, irregular eyes beseeching. I saw Cali by the edge of a cliff. She was in a white frock hopping from foot to foot, at six years maybe, humming a silly tune about frogs and snails.| \n\nIn the distance, I can see an army of thousands, in armor, with banners from the Last Frost. Cali did not seem concerned. She had found a snail. She loved snails and one on her finger becomes her world.|\n\nThis is the song that streams now through the transport. It’s by Turo of Amber-7. Do you know it? \n\n“I surrender myself to the thing I do not know, the edges of my resistance fade, the part which was mine now unfolded unraveled and decoded. It’s an empty hash within an empty space …”|\n\nI’ll look for you in the transit. Grumps sends regards.|\n\nmobysnail",
