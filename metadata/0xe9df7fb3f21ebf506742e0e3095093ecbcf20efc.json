    "description": "06/12/19 â€“ Paracas, Ica - Peru\n\nIf life is not a surprise, I praise the moment it becomes one. There is beauty in the unexpected.\n\nThis single- shot exposure was taken at one of the most beautiful locations in Paracas called the Mendieta beach. This marked the start of a 2-week landscape & time-lapse photography trip for a big local audiovisual producer called Rebeca.\n\nThis celestial conjunction shows Venus, the new moon and Jupiter dropping through the horizon as the reminiscent light rays hit the clouds in the background.\n\nTwilight is the period of time before sunrise and after sunset, in which the atmosphere is partially illuminated by the sun, being neither totally dark or completely lit. However, there are three categories of twilight that are defined by how far the sun is below the horizon. This is the Nautic Twilight due to the sun being 12 degrees below the horizon.\n\n14173 x 7973 JPEG\n\n90x50 CM 1/10 fine art cotton paper print delivered anywhere in the world for the collector.",
