    "description": "Stepping into this virtual kitchen, with the grandmother as an oracle, we will receive her words and advice that have been passed on from generation to generation. With the Mate (traditional South American caffeine-rich infused drink)  as a metronome, a moment of thought to think about what has been passed on us and what we want to pass on.",
