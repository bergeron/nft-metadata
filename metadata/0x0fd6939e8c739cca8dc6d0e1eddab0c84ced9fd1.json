    "description": "Moments in Pahreah\n\nA moment in time, capturing unique desert textures  \nthat have remained unseen to the masses.  \nMy passion runs wild when I photograph desert textures,  \na style that's craving to take off in the world of art.  \nNestled in a current ghost town, founded in 1870  \nunder the name of Pahreah, later renamed to Paria.\n\nThis image continues to baffle me with the alien-like textures  \nand patterns, and the canals that create depth in the landscape.\n\nI chose to use this image as an edition for it's complete unique imagery \nas there is nothing like it in the current market. I believe by opening up my best artwork at a low entry price, it will be my next stepping stone into becoming the well known artist I dream of achieving. \n\nMy art is my best representation of my life and my passion",
