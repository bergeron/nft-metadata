    "description": "The Primordial Dream is the region of the Astral Realms which corresponds to the astral representation of the nightmares and terrors of humanity.\n\nIt is located on the outskirts of Temenos, the realm of the collective consciousness of humanity, almost like a boundary between it and the Anima Mundi, the soul of the world.\n\nIt sees its origins at the dawn of humanity, even before the invention of language.\n\nSome humans are still able to dream deeply, so much so that they can learn the wisdom presented by the Primordial Dream.\n\nThis is what happened to me, I am trapped in this world.",
