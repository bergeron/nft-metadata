    "description": "Leap of faith\nI know this journey ain't easy.\nIt overwhelms me, when my closest kins pull me down. \nIt aches when they attend to what would the world think, but me. \nIt is frightening to walk all those scarcely lit path, without a consort. \nBut I’m certain I’ll not close doors on my dreams today. \nFor today, I choose to unwind my fairy wings\n& travel that untrodden path. \nCall me arrogant! Call me selfish! \nBut I shall not stop to rise above. \nFor this is my leap of faith.",
