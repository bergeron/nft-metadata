    "description": "My name is Mazare and I am a drum and bass producer from Italy. \n\nMy creative process usually revolves around writing an instrumental and then looking for the right voice and lyrics to convey the feelings I experienced while producing.\n\nThrough this process I had the pleasure to work with many incredible singers and bands over the years, but never really got the chance to play around with vocal samples that much.\n\nMy goal with this song was to switch things up a bit, starting from a sample and building a full song around it instead.\n",
