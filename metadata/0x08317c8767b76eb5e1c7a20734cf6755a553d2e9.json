    "description": "It's easy for feelings to become blurred in the rat race of trying to \"make it\" as an artist. You can become overwhelmed, and force yourself to feel numb to guard your mental.\n\nDon't let yourself become consumed by it all. If you are feeling numb, spend some time in nature or with loved ones to feel again. Your creativity will thank you <3",
