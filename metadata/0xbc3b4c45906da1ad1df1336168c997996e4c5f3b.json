    "description": "I was sitting in front of him\nHe stared at me and I stared at him\n\nI lit a candle and played my favorite song\nI loaded the brush with some color and started painting \nI had no clue where the canvas(he) will take me this time\nLittle by little, the brush made its way on the canvas and the scenes were created\nI believe in the magic of the white canvas\nAnd this time Nirvana, a forest far away from sadness and in distant time and space, was created.\n\n*The final loopable output is generated from my original acrylic painting.",
