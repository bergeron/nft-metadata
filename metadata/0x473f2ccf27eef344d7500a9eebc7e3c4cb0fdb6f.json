    "description": "LostBoy is about how I sometimes feel like a lost boy in this massive web3 gallery. All the grown-ups seem to know what they're doing and I am still trying to figure out what's going on. But I also see the grown-ups falling for rugs. I'm surrounded by amazing artworks that I get to adore on a daily basis, but I'm also trying to find my own way to get my own art up there. That's why the central figure makes so much sense to be a little lost boy. In this style I've been working on for months, I've tried to express emotions on the subjects face using the bare minimum and if you look at the boy, it seems pretty spot on: alone, confused... lost.\nThe terror of being left alone in a supermarket was a big inspiration for the concept of this piece. When we were children, supermarkets looked so huge and being left alone was terrifying. That's how I sometimes feel to be honest. That's why I made this piece.",
