    "description": "I am a writer, but I have always been afraid to share my work. Fear of criticism, fear of being vulnerable, the unwavering belief that my writing is not worthy of attention. \n\nOne year ago, my father passed away suddenly after a routine surgery gone wrong. This is my journal entry on the day of his surgery. My thoughts, sadness, shock, and fear are now burned into the blockchain. Only love and thankfulness remain for the time we had together. \n\nIt is now that I break through my fear. It is now that I show my vulnerability. For my dad, who I miss every day. For myself, who was scared to be seen. For myself, who is no longer afraid. For my future as an artist.",
