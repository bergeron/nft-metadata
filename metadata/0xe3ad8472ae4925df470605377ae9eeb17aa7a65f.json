    "description": "\"Most people fall in love for the first time as teenagers. I guess I'm a late bloomer. Maybe I'm too picky. On May 30, 1995, I finally fell in love for the first time. It was raining that night. When I looked at her, I suddenly felt like I was a store. And she was me. Without any warning, she suddenly enters the store. I don't know how long she'll stay. The longer the better, of course.\"\n\n- from Fallen Angels, 1995, directed by Wong Kar-Wai.",
