    "description": "1/3\n\nAnimation by Dorotheus & music by D.Clakes\n\n\"This work expresses the path that every artist goes through at least once in his life. There are many names for this path. Burnout, creative crisis, lack of ideas, absent-mindedness, paranoia due to the obsessive thought of not having your own style. And it so happened that the roots grow from the same place: Loss of meaning.\nAnd as it was, is and will be, he returns to the most unexpected time in the most unexpected place and moment. The main thing is not to give up and keep moving forward! After all, he never appears where you are at this moment, but nearby, literally a step away. You just need to take this step, no matter in which direction, it is important not to stand still, because step by step, door by door, corner by corner, and he will definitely show up. All you have to do is grab it and don't let go. It's like looking for Something in the attic in a pile of old rubbish or a needle in a haystack or... A diamond in the jungle.\"",
