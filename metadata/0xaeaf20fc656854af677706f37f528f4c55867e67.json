    "description": "With the rapid development of science and technology, human beings have been able to produce antimatter as energy fuel, making interstellar voyage a reality. One day in 2800 AD, while passing through the interstellar rift near Canis, the fleet, which was on an interstellar research mission, was hit by a cosmic storm blown out of the rift. Intense energy rays destroyed all the ships of the fleet, and the team was forced to land on nearby planets. After landing, it was found that the planet turned out to be Bichon Planet. There are many pillars of light straight into clouds on Bichon Planet. Scientists have found that beneath the pillar of light is the dark matter mineral that human beings have been hard searching forï¿½ In addition, there are a large number of Bichon Fighters living on Bichon Planet, who are as close to humans as the Bichons on earth. The difference is that although the Bichon Fighters are lovely in appearance and docile in character, they have super combat effectiveness. More importantly, for a long time, they feed on cosmic energy rays emitted by interstellar cracks. They are born to resist the invasion of dark matter, and can help humans collect dark matter minerals on the planet and repair the damaged fleet. Distant interstellar cracks burst out cosmic storms and energy rays from time to time, and there seems to be something terrifying in the cracks. At this critical juncture, human beings need to seek the help of the Bichon Fighters on Bichon Planet to collect dark matter minerals and to face unknown challenges together.",
