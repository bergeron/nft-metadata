    "name": "View of the cape after sunset",
    "description": "It is said to be the earliest point cape in Japan where the Kuroshio Current comes in contact with the sea. Although not well known as a tourist destination, the beauty of the coast is stunning and has become a popular spot visited by a very few photographers and sea fishing enthusiasts. One loses track of time as one gazes at the ever-changing gradation of sky and sea as the sun shades the shore.\n\nTaken in November 2021\nJapan, Tosashimizu, Kochi\n\nThis photo was published by 1x.com, a photo review site.\n\nsize:5134 × 3423",
