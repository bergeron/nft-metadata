    "description": "\"I just wanna lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I ever wanted.\"â€”Kevin Malone in The Office\n\nAre hotdogs the perfect food? I think about them a lot. It's meat and bread, and whatever else you feel like eating. Feeling like a salad? have a Chicago dog. Want to keep it simple? Just go with ketchup and mustard. Want something warm on a cold day? Put some chili on it.\n\nI built this in Cinema 4D, Houdini, and Redshift. It took ten days solid of rendering time. ",
