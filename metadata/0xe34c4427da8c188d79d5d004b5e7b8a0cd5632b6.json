    "description": "Welcome to my first ever open edition digital collectible!! \n\nMy name is Elior Marques,  I'm a cinema student at SFSU & have been obsessed with crypto art since I launched my Generative Art collection \"Moonstars\" at the beginning of last year. This piece has a lot of personal signifcance to me beyond the \"Morning / Mourning\" play on words but art is subjective and whatever you see or feel from this piece is valid, even if unintentional. Feel free to post it as a colletible on IG tag me @eliorstore / @meowlior ü´°\n\n(P.S. This is more than a digital collectible. If burnt it can be redeemed for ANY token in the \"Moonstars\" collection on opensea & could give you access to token gated content in the future )\n\n\n\n\n\n",
