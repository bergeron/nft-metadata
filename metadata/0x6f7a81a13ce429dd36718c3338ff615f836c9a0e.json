Our project is a collaborative effort to reimagine and contemporize the prolific 19th century works of Utagawa Kuniyoshi. Kuniyoshi is widely considered to be the last prolific great master of the Ukiyoe traditional wood block printing artform in Japan. The works of Kuniyoshi are not well known outside of Japan except within niche artist communities. However, Matsuzaki studio firmly believes the artistry, breadth, and soul of Utagawa's \"The 108 Heroes of the Popular Suikoden\" series truly transcends time. We seek to re-illustrate these works in a manner that brings the essence of Kuniyoshi's vision to a contemporary audience, expanding and reformatting the series for the 21st century while paying respect to the greats that paved the way for artists like ourselves.",
