    "description": "This piece titled 'Wells' is named after Ida B. Wells (1862-1931),  an African American civil rights advocate, journalist, & early leader for the civil rights movement. She battled sexism, racism, and violence using her skills as a journalist to bring like to social injustice across the south. \n\nWhen primary colors are mixed at equal parts, black is ultimately the precipitating color. During the process, an imperial display of tones appears in the swirling to mirror powerful structure & emotion from the subjects. At a crucial time for the nation to unite, I hope this collection encourages empathy, unity & a non-binary view of race. Black is a color challenges one to see past profiling & foresee the beauty that is capable of elevating the human experience. Black is a color demands that we look past skin tone, & into beautiful, infinitely complex humans. \n\n100% of the net proceeds of the sales of these NFT's will go to creators of African descent, 25% to the models, 75% to artist focusing on creating meaningful work around social justice.",
