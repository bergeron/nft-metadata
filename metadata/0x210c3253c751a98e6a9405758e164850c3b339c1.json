    "description": "As I walk through the garden I am greeted by the sweet voices of the flowers, their songs carried on the gentle breeze. Harmonious and beautiful they sing of bright summer days, peaceful views and promises of bountiful blooms. The dahlias dominate the chorus, their large heads lifted high, as if in praise to the sun. Pink petals beaming, drinking in the warm rays of the sun, refreshed and renewed, ready for a new day. ",
