    "description": "Once upon a dream, I saw a beautiful drawing of a heart. It was not just any heart, but a symbol of love, health, well-being, and sensuality. As I gazed at it in awe, I suddenly found myself standing in front of the legendary artist Salvador Dali. He smiled at me warmly and began to share his insights about the artwork.\n\nHe revealed that the heart represented a developed sense of intuition, guiding us towards the purpose of our lives. It also symbolized the love within ourselves that we share with the world, spreading joy and positivity wherever we go. I was mesmerized by his words and felt inspired to embrace these values in my own life.\n\nAs I woke up from my dream, I knew that this was how love blossoms - through intuition, purpose, and self-love. And I couldn't help but feel grateful for the magical encounter with Salvador Dali, who reminded me of the power of art to inspire and transform our lives.\n\nSize : 50cm  x 70cm\nNFT : 4600 x 6132 pixels; 300 dpi",
