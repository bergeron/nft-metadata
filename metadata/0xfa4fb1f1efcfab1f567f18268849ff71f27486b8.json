    "description": "\"Gravel Swirl\" is my first official NFT. A simulated piece of abstract art. Perfect for digital wall displays. \n\nAs the gravel gracefully dances around the rock, it seems to take on a life of its own, creating a symphony of movement and texture that leaves one transfixed. The play of light and shadow on the rough, textured surfaces of the gravel and the rock invites the viewer to contemplate the intricacies of the natural world.",
