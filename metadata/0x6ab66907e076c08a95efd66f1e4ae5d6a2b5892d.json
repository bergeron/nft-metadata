    "description": "Philadelphia born and raised, my heart will forever be within this city. Endless perspectives throughout Philadelphia provide marvelous views. \n\nMost are typically unable to witness these scenes with their own eyes. Aside from the rich, the select few determined to access these vantage points cherish these experiences for the rest of their lives. \n\nWhen dusk arrives, a feeling of tranquility overtakes.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
