    "name": "Tien Again by Enrico Tubertini",
    "description": "In this transmutography,  Enrico Tubertini wants to underline how this iconic image of Tienamen square is once again relevant. In this current period there are two sides with Ukraine as a buffer. On the one hand, NATO with a vision of war, of conquest (the spikes on his territory are visible) with a man who is only half blue and half black (divided between nationalism and the new world order). On the other hand, the Russian world which, on the other hand, wants to build (cubes and not points are visible) with a single man, completely red and divided only by a thin white line which is the Don Bass question. The Ukraine buffer has a single, faded but blue man. There is also a wall on the left of the image where blue reigns, while the red building creates a staircase. The meeting point or the breaking point of the two empires is full of men. As the man stopped the tanks, will these men be building or destroying the peace? The choice is up to the audience.\n",
