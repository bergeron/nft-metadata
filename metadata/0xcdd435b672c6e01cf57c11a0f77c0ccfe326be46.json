    "description": "Every individual must come to that point of need where the only thing that will make true meaning is the help of an Angel; seen or unseen. Nobody is immune against this part of life.\n\nThese Angels are not necessarily celestial beings. They mostly will come to us as family, friends, neighbors, etc.  Angels are everywhere around you if you believe in them.",
