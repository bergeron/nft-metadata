    "description": "Feeling inspired by this captured slice of the Earthâ€™s transition, as my eye traveled across the ground, climbed into the trees, flew into the clouds, and floated into the blue heaven.\n\nThis transition from the cold hibernation of winter, and into the rejuvenation of the Earth for spring. Indeed, serving as a springboard to the beauty of summer.\n\nThe worn bleached tan stalks serving as remnants of a winter gone by. \nThe sandy faint yellow green of the grassy fields beginning to awaken.\nThe powerful energetic limbs of the green trees reaching into the sky.\nThe dynamic shapes of the lively white clouds, as they float across the calm sea of the blue sky.\nThe crystal clean air provides a fresh satisfying aroma. \n\nCan you see it? Can you smell it? Can you feel it?\n",
