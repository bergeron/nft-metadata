    "description": "Time is like a whirlwind, flying at incredible speeds, spinning us into a series of events, emotions, sensations, and trials. So much so that sometimes you stop feeling the ground under your feet. \n\nThe world is unstable, times are uncertain, memorable moments are fleeting, and love is not always forever. \n\nA woman is constant only in her variability, strong even in her softness, beautiful inside, even as time changes her on the outside. \n\nCherish these moments in time, freeze them, replay them, and remember them. Play them over and over so that even as the whirlwind of time continues its unceasing march forward, you will never forget these magical, ephemeral memories in time.\n\n✦ \n\n2765x4140 px\n\nSound: Sasha Kojevin",
