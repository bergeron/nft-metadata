Once ordered, your NFT metadata will update to \"Redeemed\".\n\nOnce fabricated, we ship your neon to you - at that time, your NFT's artwork will also update to an animated version, fading between a studio photo of your neon & the original art - showcasing final product while preserving the original artwork.\n\n*All fabrication & delivery costs (within Continental US) are included with NFT Price\n\n---\n\n!!! IMPORTANT\n\nDuring the redemption process, you must not sell or list the NFT, or the fabrication will be halted.",
