    "description": "Time and technology changes the minds of humans. We can evolve and come together. There is a new reality that becomes possible that was once impossible if we let it. The space and time of the past are brought near to each other. \n\nThis is artificial intelligence art composed from the ideas and words of the artist which an Ai model  generated three images and then edited by the hand of the artist. \n\nIt is composed of images of the valleys and mountains of Switzerland (Occident) and the images of Petra (Orient). The flying saucer represents the future where there is no division between the Orient and the Occident. The style of the art is in the form of David Roberts an artist from the 1800s. This symbolizes the past. The shrinkage of time and space with is the future. The flying saucer symbolizes decentralized crypto technology.",
