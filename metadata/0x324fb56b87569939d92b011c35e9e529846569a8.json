    "description": "Her name is Panai Chan. I designed her as a profile picture in 2018 and moved forward together. \nAt that time she did not have a name yet.\n\nI jumped into the NFT world in late 2021 and 2022　was a year that focused on interacting with people I had relationships with at NFT.\n\nI came into contact with several communities and exchanges and chatted a great deal. \nNot only did I come into contact with new knowledge, views, and businesses, but new ideas were born from them.\n\nThe name Panai Chan was born from a single word in the community Teru la Panai means Not TeruLapi.\n\nI named her name after this event and my ideal of wanting to do something amazing in my name and actions.\n\nOne person cannot do something great immediately.\nI realized that contact with and support from many people and the brilliance of the works I have created will give me the power to make great strides.\n\nWith a face as bright as Panai Chan we move forward into a vibrant future.\n",
