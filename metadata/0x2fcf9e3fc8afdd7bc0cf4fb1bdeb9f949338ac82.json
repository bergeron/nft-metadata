    "description": "\"The Multiverse of the Ape\" aesthetically displays the 5th dimension of \"Caesar\", the leader of an Ape army.\n\nThis 1/1 generative art piece is the result of 1-in-a million chances of randomness, showing his different timelines shaping into the form of his face. \n\n\"The Multiverse of the Ape\" can be generated only once, and it is impossible to replicate. Its unintentional likeness to the ape makes this piece priceless.\n\nKind: PNG\nDimension: 4000 × 4800\nSize: 39.8 MB",
