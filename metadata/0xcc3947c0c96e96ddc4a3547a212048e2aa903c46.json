    "description": "\"Cities are a collection of many things: of memories, of desires, of signs of a language; cities are places of exchange, [â€¦] but these exchanges are not only exchanges of goods, they are exchanges of words, desires, memories.\" Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino\n \nThe City of Harmony represent the law arranged by the universe in the act of creation, which regulates the relationship between the spiritual substances that make up the world, each of which contains in itself as representation, implicit or explicit, the totality of the others.  \n\nThe triangle shapes of the City of Harmony communicate dynamism and serves as a direction indicator, with their three sides and three points represents the completeness and at the same time the origin of any evolution. Harmony has a musical meaning, of proportion and unity. \n",
