    "description": "Water is a symbol of the \"feminine\" side of the soul, she is fluidity, flexibility, and expansiveness. Water embodies the sensitive and emotional aspect, but at the same time she can be dangerous and capable of causing destruction.\n\nAs a woman, Water is life itself, changeable and multifaceted, passive, impressionable, easily influenced, receptive, and pliable. However, Water is the primary magical force, characterized by detachment from everything real and earthly, inner variability, and purity.\n\nPhysical painting 50x70cm\nAcrylic, silver plating\n\nArtsize 2629x3929px",
