    "description": "Cikoria #20\n\nDusk sets in the small and remote settlement in western Hungary. Marta, carrying a bottle of Martini and a bouquet of plastic flowers that she’d just bought for her sister-in-law’s birthday arrives at the Horvaths.\nMusic clips flicker on a decrepit screen.\n“…might trick me once, I won’t let you trick me twice…”\nMarta is being handed a cup of cold coffee. Black, three spoons of sugar. She lights a cigarette.\n“…freedom to us has always been a trick, freedom to you has always been whoever landed on your dick…”\n“Where’s Erzsi?” Marta asks.\n“In prison, she’ll return tomorrow.”\n\nCikoria (2015-2016) is the portrait of a small Roma settlement in Hungary.\nThough Roma are an integral part of Hungary since centuries, the great majority is leading a life on the edge of society.\nThe Roma people of Cikoria are trapped between mainstream society that at best tolerates, at worst openly displays their hostility towards them and their own traditions, that became fragmented over time.",
