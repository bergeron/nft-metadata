    "description": "City never disappoints, the faces does. The glare and the shine makes you feel fascinated to thrive and drive in the city. In some people there's an urge to get the call in the first place, to respond to it immediately. \n\nIn this artwork in particular, the woman is having her time. Answering her call from the city. Being a wallflower, she never attracts the attention and never seeks it yet lowkey wants it. This is her favorite spot as the complete terrain view can be seen through here with an amazing utopian feel. This part of the city calls for her and her persona to cue the wave of serenity. \n\nAs the title says! 'City calls' the city calls you with the opportunity to offer and you should always pickup. Being a wallflower, or a mingler, one should always respond to the call.",
