    "description": "Launch of Antares NG-11 from Wallops Island, Virginia.  This was my first ever rocket launch.  In April 2019, I had the opportunity to participate in a NASA Social.  These events allow you back-stage access to NASA facilities and access to NASA scientists.  The culminating experience is a rocket launch.  This image was taken just 2 miles from the pad, which is the closest you can get to a rocket launch anywhere in the United States.  My heart was pumping as the countdown clock ticked down to zero.  When it launched, I wasn’t prepared for the excitement and I wasn’t prepared for the sound.  As the rocket goes up, you feel the sound in your chest.  When I looked at my camera, I was thrilled to see this shot in the viewfinder.  It’s an experience that I never forgot and has led me to photograph many more launches.",
