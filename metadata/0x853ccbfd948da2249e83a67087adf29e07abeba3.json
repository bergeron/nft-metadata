    "description": "This series delves into a surreal, minimal world inspired by film noir and classic black-and-white imagery. Instead of making bright, colorful compositions, I decided to change direction and focus on my inner emotions and the complexities found within. I often use art to come out of the darkness. In this series, I channel my inner darkness. \n\nThis experimental digital collage contains scanned imagery from vintage magazines.  ",
