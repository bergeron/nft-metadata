    "description": "My son’s genesis art.\n\nThis is the very beginning of Kazuhiro Liem to try an art in canvas in acrylic. He put every colors in a canvas which I had but in the end the art is so beautiful. I think my son has talent in art.\n\nThis situation reminds me when I was a little kid, I played with my father’s colors paste, copied him when he painted something.\n\nI believe this is not the end of his journey because I saw seriousness in him while he was painting and good feeling that came up after that. This is the painter’s feeling.\n\nI glad that his art in the blockchain. It means one day when he grows up, he will see this and many people will see this, then it gonna be so precious.\n\nArt Media: Acrylic\nStyle: Abstract\nDate he made the art: 11/22/2022\nCanvas Size: 4 x 4 inch (10.2 x 10.2 cm)\n",
