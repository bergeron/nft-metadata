    "description": "I wrote Biblical about going back to someone I knew was bad for me over and over again. In a way it helped me break the cycle. That day in the studio was so fun. It wrote itself and it was such a perfect, hot song to me, that just spoke to exactly how I was feeling. I decided I wouldn’t write about that relationship again and that I wanted to move on. I love this song. It’s so special to me for that reason.\n\n",
