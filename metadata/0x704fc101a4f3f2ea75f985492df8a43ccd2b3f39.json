    "name": "The Nemrut Crater Lake",
    "description": "One of the places that impressed me the most during my visit to the Southeastern and Eastern Regions of Turkey was Nemrut Crater Lake. Nemrut Crater Lake is the  widest crater lake in Turkey. \nMount Nemrut was named after the Babylonian The Emperor Nemrut, who lived in 2100 BC. \nLake Nemrut is located in the west of Lake Van basin, between Tatvan, Ahlat and Guroymak districts of Bitlis province.\nTo reach the lake, you must first follow the road with your vehicle. Then you have to walk on a path so that you can reach the part of the lake and explore amazing scene. I waited for a while not to get wet under the trees because of the rain that started while climbing to this point and took this shoot. Photographers and nature lovers should definitely visit this natural wonder which is located between the Nemrut Mountain. \n\n\nArtist: Koray Özpalamutçu\nGear: FujiFilm GFX 50R\nLens: FujiFilm GF23mm\nISO: 100\nShutter Speed: 1/110s\nAperture: f/11\n",
