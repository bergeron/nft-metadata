    "description": "This photograph was captured in the Nand baba temple in Nandgaon , Uttar Pradesh. The shot was taken from the first floor of the temple. The main temple building along with the hundreds of people are seen in the background while a Lion-masked man is the subject. \nPeople sit atop with buckets full of water and colors to pour over the people passing below them. Its like they are a wild cat patiently waiting for their prey to come in the vicinity so they could attack. \nCo-incidentally, this man was not just ready with his bucket, but also had on a Lion mask which suggested that he is searching for his next prey, i.e. the next person to drench with colors.",
