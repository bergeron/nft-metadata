    "description": "Generating AI images through natural text prompts and image extension mechanisms creates complex uncanny, neo-surreal images that can shift artistic styles seamlessly. As AI tools train on millions of images, there are endless, unpredictable possibilities for aesthetics and content. This allows for a queering of the imagery where bodies quickly morph one into another or into animals or objects – undoing normative representations of gender, kinship, and embodiment with ease; and simultaneously illustrating the dissociated affect inherent in both mediated relations and traumatized individuals.\n\n\n\n Year: 2023\n\nEdition: NFT 1 of 1\n\nCopyright: © 2023 Jess Mac.
