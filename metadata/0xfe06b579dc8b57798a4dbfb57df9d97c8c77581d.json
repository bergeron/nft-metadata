    "description": "From a dutch front angle, to inches above the ground at the rear wheel; we are consumed by chaos and rubble. \"The Shot\" stands out as one of my most memorable and iconic film moments to date.  Recorded in 4k at 420 frames per second, we are able to slow time down and climb out of the chaos and into \"The Shot\".",
