    "description": "A counterpoint to war, the primary image is derived from artist Trek Thunder Kelly’s mural painted this summer on the House of Culture in Irpine, which was destroyed by Russian bombardment. Bullet holes dot the cracked plaster wall. \n\n The flower rises from collected car wreckage nearby, also beautified by flowers for hope. The image is framed by collapsing buildings. Helen Yanko, a Ukrainian artist who also painted murals, stands to the right. Slavic, Trek’s paint-talented uber driver, leans against the building. \n\n The stray dogs who kept them company lounge in the sun before the cars. Evelyn Ahlvarsson, a young Swedish girl who painted sunflowers distributed to Ukrainian children, displays one of her creations to the left.",
