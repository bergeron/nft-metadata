    "name": "Remember the flight",
    "description": "This handmade artwork is inspired by a poem from Forough Farrokhzad that says :\n“Remember the flight, the bird is mortal”\nA flight which is unfinished and shattered. And with the pouring down of the wings and feathers of the bird, some pieces of blue sky that symbolize freedom and liberation also fall.\nThis artwork was created in 2011 with the Marbling technique. In this technique, a combination of different colors and materials such as gouache, oil paint, etc. is used on the paper.\n\nIt was published in 2016 in the online ‘artist PORTFOLIO magazine’. On the following link page 121:\nissuu.com/artistportfoliomagazine/docs/issue26\n\nAlso it has been awarded the Diploma of Excellence by the Art Addiction Online Gallery in 2014. Further my works included “Remember the flight” had been nominated for the 9. | FEMALE ARTIST'S ART ANNUAL Awards of Distinction:\nwww.artaddiction.net/Female9/Parisa-Shahmoradi/Shahmoradi.htm\n\nThis is my First NFT and I'll drop more Marbling artworks soon!",
