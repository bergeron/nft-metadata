    "description": "From a distance I saw this mother and calf cuddling with each other and my excitement was real! I’ve captured a lot of single Teddycows, but getting a good shot of 2 is super hard. So I slowly approached them with the intention to not disturb them in their morning cuddle. I witnessed the preciousness for a few minutes and I was hoping for exactly what I captured in this image.
