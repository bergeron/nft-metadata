    "description": "Four and a half years ago, I fell in love. A year ago, that relationship ended. From the day that I met her up until the completion of this piece, I wrote about the highs, the lows, the most mundane, and the most exciting pieces of falling in love, being in love, and then falling out of love. I have compiled over 140 of those writings in this piece, including poems, short stories, brief thoughts, and unfinished letters. I believe that all of them are as equally true as they are untrue. Every individual writing is an accurate portrayal of how I felt, or thought I felt, in a specific moment.  [This is meant to explain everything that I could never say out loud. Thank you for everything.]",
