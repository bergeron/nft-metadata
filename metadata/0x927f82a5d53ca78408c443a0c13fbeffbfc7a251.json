    "description": "X&ND is entangled in a relationship fueled by lust and power in his new single, \\\"Beg For It\\\"‚Äô shows the side of X&ND who chooses lust regardless of the consequences; abandoning his internal struggles for a night of passion to heal the pain. Perhaps burned by a rejected invitation for intimacy in his previous single, ‚ÄúCan You Let Me In?‚Äù, this seductive record shows a man who has given up on a deeper connection to focus purely on the physical, singing, ‚Äúdesire‚Äôs all that I have left‚Äù. Owners of the 'Beg For It' digital collectible receive price advantages for X&ND's future drops, and access to token-gated events, as he rolls out his upcoming album. The 'Beg For It' digital collectible also marks X&ND's first single for the XANDYLANDERS; a day-one community of lovers and broken hearts who have connected with X&ND during live shows, and chose to commemorate their experience through the \\\"Rise of X&ND\\\" collection. Members of this passionate community receive premium access to community token-gated experiences, as well as premium access and price advantages to X&ND's future drops as he rolls out his upcoming album.",
