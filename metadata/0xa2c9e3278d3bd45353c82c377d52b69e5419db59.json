    "description": "‘Hide & Seek’ is a fully hand done drawing and is a hybrid of styles and aesthetics that have influenced me as an artist over the years – a mix of old and new. Thematically this monochromatic collection is about taking slices from my own personal life that are actually quite mundane but adding some theatricality to it and visually elevated them into a myth  - primarily to entertain myself and create intriguing works of art.",
