    "description": "After the death of king T'Chaka, and since the royal family of Wakanda never had kids, the throne and role of Black Panther was passed to Queen Ramonda.  \nThe Panther Habit is a uniquely crafted vibranium-weave suit used by the Black Panther, the protector of Wakanda. The habit's vibranium composition makes the user completely bulletproof and near-indestructible. With two sets of deployable vibranium claws embedded in the tips of the gloves' fingers, they serve as a primary weapon of Ramonda during combat. The claws are exceptionally strong and razor-sharp, being able to cut through almost anything.",
