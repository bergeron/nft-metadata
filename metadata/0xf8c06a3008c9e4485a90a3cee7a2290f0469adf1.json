    "description": "*Microscopy of the Union Flag* (MotUF) is a forensic visual examination of the British flag. Utilising progressively greater magnification, the series is a photographic exploration of the physical aspects of the national flag intended as a reflection on nationalism. Utilising extreme macro and microphotographic techniques, the work offers a parallel to the introspection of a country seeking a new definition of itself. \n\nOriginally exhibited in Oxford at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, the series is offered as 1/1 NFTs exclusive to Foundation. The pieces will be supplied as jpegs at 6715 x 4477 px.\n\n",
