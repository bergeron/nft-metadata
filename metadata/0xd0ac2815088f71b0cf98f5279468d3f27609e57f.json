    "description": "Before painting each mural I will create a claim for an edition of the blank, unpainted wall. Once the mural is painted, NFTs will be made from the final mural that will showcase the abstract detail and texture to mirror the experience of viewing the mural in person, and airdropped to collectors of the blank wall. \n\nFinal mural NFT structure, edition sizes, prices, and listing format will vary but will be clearly articulated for each project when the first blank wall is listed.",
