    "description": "Jealous people sometimes begin to take revenge. Under the influence of this strong feeling, they fall into madness. The end is usually sad.\n.\n“Love is as strong as death; its jealousy as unyielding as the grave. It burns like a blazing fire; like a mighty flame. Many waters cannot quench love, rivers cannot wash it away.”",
