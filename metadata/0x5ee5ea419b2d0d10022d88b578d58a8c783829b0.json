    "description": "'...Late one night, in a drunken state, he boarded a small row boat down by the rocks on the shore. It was the last any of the other local fishermen had seen him. Some say he went out to far and got caught in a storm at sea and drowned. Other, more superstitious folk, say he stumbled upon the ghost of Ida, an infamous wet nurse who drowned when on the run from allegedly murdering an infant. Since her passing many infants would go missing in the area and the blame was always down to her hostile spirit.'\n\n'Ida' Artwork by Jason James Smith.\n\n3000x3600px",
