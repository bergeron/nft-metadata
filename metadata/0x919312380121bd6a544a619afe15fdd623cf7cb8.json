    "description": "This image has never been released or published and was shot just after “American Sniper” premiered, so there was a lot of excitement surrounding this shoot. We built a small portrait studio on location at Mr. Eastwood’s Production office in Burbank, CA. There were casting photos and outlines for the film still tacked to the wall. Between shots, he would walk over to the wall and point out certain characters and share stories about what it was like working with actors and what inspired their roles.",
