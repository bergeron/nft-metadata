    "description": "The golden green hillsides of Mt Tamalpais is where you would find me most evenings over the last 4 years of my life. This place has drawn me in as a kid with its seemingly endless trails navigating across the mountain. Even though the location is over an hour away from my house I would find odd jobs with a camera just to afford to drive up there 3 to 4 nights a week.\n\nThere is no place more meaningful or impactful in my life than this small 2500 ft mountain hugging the coastline of the northern Bay Area. From the foggy summer evenings to the deep green fields of winter. Mt Tam is a location I've visited more than any other location over this journey of chasing light. I truly feel like this mountain is at the core of my landscape photography.\n",
