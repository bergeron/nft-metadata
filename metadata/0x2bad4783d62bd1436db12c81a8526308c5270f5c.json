    "description": "This piece is an abstract expression of the ambience of Annah Rais Longhouse situated in the rainforest of Sarawak, Borneo. The painting represented the heavy textures and rich specimens of plants and trees, with morning sunlight shining on top of the hill and some mist surrounding it. This was produced during the Sarawak-International Art Camp 2022 in December. \n\nThis is also the first NFT Art given to the Sarawak government (Ministry of Ministry of Tourism, Creative Industry & Performing Arts of Sarawak).\n\nFull copyrights of this artwork belong to Sarawak Artists Society and the Ministry of Tourism, Creative Industry & Performing Arts of Sarawak.",
