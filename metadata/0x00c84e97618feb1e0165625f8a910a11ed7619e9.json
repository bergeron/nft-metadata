    "description": "While my mother was battling her kidney disease, the bus was the only mode of transportation that I relied on the most. I can spend up to 2 hours getting to my mom's house. Yes, I live in a different city from my mother.\n\nIt's common for me to wait up to 30 minutes or even more at the bus stop because there are so many passengers who are not matched by the number of bus fleets. It's very rare for me to see an empty bus stop. Always crowded with passengers. Now I rarely take public transportation, because my mother no longer has to go to the hospital.",
