    "description": "12y/o web3 Fashion designer since she was 11.\nFor KAREN11, the best outlet for expression as well as to serve as fuel for motivating herself has been the world of Fashion.\nNot only does she have a hyper sensibility, but she has also felt cramped at times due to feelings of suffocation from a number of barriers that presented themselves to her from an early age. She also struggled with depression due to social pressure.\nShe overcame her depression by chanelling it into her artwork.\nIt wasn’t until she watched the movie called Belle that she could come to the realization that, in the web3 world, anyone is able to express WHO they really are and to whatever ends they would like to be—surpassing any form of constraints of age, gender, body type, constitution, or any other physical boundaries.\n\nActually, rising from the depth of despair,  KAREN11 came to live herself now.  She had just realized and would express Darkside is not the end of the world, but the beginning of the following story.",
