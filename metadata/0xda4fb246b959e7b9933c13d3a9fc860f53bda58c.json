    "description": "There are infinite beings inside each one of us. Divine powers, souls, higher callings, alienated feelings, call them anything you like. They help us, shape us, and mold us into creatures who will always be on a journey to inner paths through psychedelics and other spiritual remedies. Embrace them, connect with them and keep seeking a higher purpose within to give meaning to a meaningless world.",
