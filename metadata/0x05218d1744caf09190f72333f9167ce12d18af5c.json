    "description": "Titled, \"Memories Of A Masterpiece,\" this collection of 999 artworks is inspired by the volition to capture, recreate, or relive a memory. Each piece leverages hand-cut pieces of paper, individually laid out and scanned in by me. Leaning into the idea that moments are spontaneous and can never be replicated exactly, each artwork from this collection can only exist as a “memory” on the blockchain.",
