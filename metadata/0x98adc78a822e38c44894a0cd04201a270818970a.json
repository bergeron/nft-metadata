    "description": "Common Spaces, created by Sasha Belitskaja, is a collection of 100 unique self-contained microverses that challenge our perception of digital space. The project is explorative in nature, inviting viewers to navigate and discover new dimensions of a common digital space. Each aspect of the world, including walls, floors, ceilings, sculptures, characters, and environmental details has been designed and created in VR - then refined through digitally painted textures. The customization aesthetics of Common Spaces offer a glimpse into the future of immersive design, where only the limits of our imagination determine the possibilities of our world.",
