    "description": "\"One of the jury members of the Mechapoledance * - The Mountain Giant - offered his hand and heart every year to each of the participants. \n\nRyu took this offer quite literally. Now the loving heart of the Giant is lovingly feeding her exoskeleton.\n\nHis hand actually opens up new grip possibilities not only to the pole, but also to the opponentsâ€™  faces.\n\n  *- In the future, all geopolitical issues will be resolved only through mechapoledance.\n\n Music: @ornorje",
