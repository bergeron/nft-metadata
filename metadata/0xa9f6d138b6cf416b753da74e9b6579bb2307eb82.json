    "description": "This is a 360 degree panoramic photo I took from \"inside\" a lake and published in the prestigious astronomy magazine Sky&Telescope. If you look carefully at the photo, which basically shows the intersection of the winter Milky Way with the Zodiac belt, a lot of details such as the Pleiades, Andromeda, Orion, M33 can be seen. To the left of the photo is east, where the strong Zodiac light that heralds the sunrise is evident. This light extends to the right of the Gegenchein light pointing in the opposite direction of the Sun. This entire Zodiac belt also shines on the Zodiac constellations Leo, Cancer, Gemini, Taurus, Aires and Pisces respectively.\n\nDate: 9 Oct 2021; 04:45am\nLocation: Salt Lake, Turkey\nCredit: Cem Ã–zkeser\nTechique: Stacked/Panorama\nSize: 6478*6478 pix (41.9MP)\n\ncemozkeser.com",
