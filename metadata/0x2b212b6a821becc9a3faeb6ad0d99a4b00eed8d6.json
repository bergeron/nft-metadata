    "description": "Eva Krausz  Venezuela 2010\n\nShe was born on June 17, 1925 in PÃ©cs, Hungary. As a child she lived in Budapest. When the ghetto was formed she was taken to forced labor, even though she was forced to marry, believing that married women were not taken. Through the Swiss embassy she returned to the ghetto and waited for her liberation. Thanks to the Joint she went to Germany, then to Paris and in 1947 to Venezuela.\n\nTestimony: \"You have to know how to cope with things. When you get old, you realize that you can't escape your destiny. Above all, you have to love people; love is the most important thing. You have to try to get rid of hatred, to repress it. You don't get any result with grudges, nor with hatred\".",
