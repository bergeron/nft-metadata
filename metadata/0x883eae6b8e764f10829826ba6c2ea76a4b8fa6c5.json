    "description": "The series 'Deconstructing life' is artist's attempt to explore various facets of human experience. At it's core, life can be understood as the experience of existence, the manifestation of being in the world, and the process of self creation. Through out the series, different experiences( mostly inspired from artist's personal life ) will be pondered upon and explored further.\n\nEpisode 1 : Love.\n\nin life, they were shunned, their love was a crime,  \nBut in hell, they were free, for there was no time.  \nThey danced in the flames, a macabre ballet,  \nTheir love was so real, it would never decay.\n\nThe demons looked on, with envy and awe,  \nFor the love that they shared, was without any flaw.  \nThey watched as they kissed, and they held each other tight,  \nTheir love was eternal, it would never take flight.\n\nIn hell, they were together, forever they'll stay,  \nTheir love was so strong, it would never decay.  \nFor even in death, their passion still burns,  \nAnd in each other's arms, their love forever yearns.",
