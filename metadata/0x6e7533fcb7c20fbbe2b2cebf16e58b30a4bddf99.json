    "description": "In the eyes flooded with oil, anguish over the irresponsible actions before, revolt over the omission during and disappointment about the after. Wiping oil \"on their arms\" several anonymous eyes fought to mitigate the impacts of successive criminal actions that culminated in the largest environmental disaster in the country.\n\nThe crude oil that hit hundreds of beaches in Brazil in August 2019, as well as, the smoke from the burning in the Amazon or the Mud in Brumadinho and Mariana, in yet another opportunity, expose the tragic consequences of the repeated mistreatment of the environment and highlight the lack of importance given, officially, to environmental issues and regional inequalities in Brazil.\n\nGuardians is a photographic series in honor of all those who do not give up and continue to fight for the common good.\n\nImages from this series are part of the collection of the Photography Museum of Fortaleza, Brazil, and of the Mediterraneum Collection, Italy.",
