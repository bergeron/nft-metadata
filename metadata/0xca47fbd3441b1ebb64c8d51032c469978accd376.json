    "description": "Skyzone started in 2020 with an entirely different sounding record, I felt like the sound was too experimental when the homie Eric (from 4km) started it but then I revisited the record in 2022 and knew exactly who to reach out to: Jamee Cornelia and Jadyn Violet. Jamee came in with an absolutely infectious energy and such a superstar verse, then Jadyn laced the record with some beautiful melodies and I went back in and redid my verse and we had a whole ass bop \n\n\n\nWritten by Jon Waltz, Jamee Cornelia & Jadyn Violet \n\nProd by 4km\n\nArtwork by Jules Lauber ",
