    "description": "Sahara Milky Way 1/1\n\nWas a warm spring night in a faraway place, in the land where beduins roam undisturbed and where your eyes wander on endless sand dunes.\n\nAll my fellow travelers were sleeping but not me, so i decided to move slightly away from the camp to admire the desert and the sky in their magnificence.\nInitially i was a little bit afraid of being alone, but that feeling was replaced immediately when i looked up towards the sky. \n\nI was not alone at all!\n\nMillions and millions of stars were shining in the sky, watching on me and keeping me safe.\nWhenever i think about that night a faint smile appears on my face and a glimpse of that gorgeous night sky shines into my eyes.",
