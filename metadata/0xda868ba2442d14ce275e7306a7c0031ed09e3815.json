    "description": "Phrenia is an exploration of emotions I feel when I'm out there being myself on the dance floor, the place where I dive in when I'm at my highest and at my lowest. \n\nAnd what I do on the floor translates to what I create on the canvas. Words and images that mean something only to me. But let that not stop you from ripping the piece apart and diving into what it could mean to you. \n\nStay with me. Stay with my art. Stay with me on the floor. ",
