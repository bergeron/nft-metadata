    "description": "all my artwork is a product of dreamtime, my subconscious speaking to the conscious brain … \n\nfor me, art is kind of like a daily journal entry … a record of the detritus of my life … my deepest personal thoughts, my feelings, my sense of funny, my sense of play, my observations about people/relationships/society/politics/day-to-day-life/movies/literature/poetry … and most importantly of all, my IMAGINATION AT PLAY …  \n\ni love art brut, i love art done by children, ii love outsider art … and seek to emulate this style to the best of my ability … it’s spontaneous, it’s authentic … and it’s FUN \n\ndigital 1/1 artwork by #e9Art … 3000x3000 … ",
