    "description": "The meaning of Saudade is deeply connected with the Portuguese culture and soul. \n\nIt is a constant feeling of absence, the sadness of something that's missing, wistful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone, a desire for presence as opposed to absence.\n\nAs insatiable as it is to find new places to explore, let's treasure the beautiful memories we already have. That is the Portuguese way of life!",
