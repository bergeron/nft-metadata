    "description": "The Calaveras NFT collection is the first to have a real effect in the game. Their utility is two-fold, firstly they will unlock the deities power of each deck which is usable once per match, secondly each will have an activatable ability in game. Depending on three of the NFTs qualities and their rarity, the area of effect, special effects and damage of this ability will vary. This will create some powerful, unique and tide turning combinations. In the story and lore of the game, Calaveras are a force of nature that arise out of concentrations of conflict. From then on they roam the lands seeking new battlefields to unleash their terrible powers on, and in doing so, recreate the conditions of their own formation. The Calaveras do not take to the field and merely unleash their might from the sidelines. They have proven to be unaffected by all attempts to stop or contain them and are walking omens of victory or defeat, depending on which side of the battle they approach from.",
