We own 10 plots on Decentraland. We are also building our own Metaverse on Unreal Engine in parallel.\n\n2) earn $room token by staking your rooms . In March 2023 we will embark on listing this token on DEX \n\n3) turn your room into a business hub by connecting your website or affiliate links to earn commissions in FIAT. Imagine when someone enters your room and interacts with your elements, it would take them to your affiliate linked website where you have potential to earn. Now imagine having 5 or 10 different stores like this in Metaverse. \n\n4) explore your room, invite friends to watch a movie, host an event in our Exhibition Centre, participate in Health Centre seminars on VR. \n\n5) fully customize and upgrade your rooms by purchasing assets from Doodle Marketplace \n\n6) display your favorite NFTs on your NFT frame in your room walls or galleries by connecting your wallet. \n\nPlease read our whitepaper for more details.\n\nDoodle Rooms 2D Genesis - https://opensea.io/collection/doodlerooms\nDoodle Sanctuary Pets - https://opensea.io/collection/doodlesanctuarypets\n",
