    "description": "Welcome to Beaker's Roadside Space Shop! \n\nBeaker has a wide variety of items for you to look at, but only if he knows you well. Otherwise, you're going to have to build up his trust by bringing him some good space junk. \n\nBeaker isn't a hard guy to find. He parks his spacecraft on the outskirts of major cities on planet TARS X-11. His signal calls out to all scrappers across the planet. He's always willing to bargain with you and give you a bit of coin for your junk. If you know him well enough, he might even cut you in on the local space junk gossip. That is, of course, if you make sure to prioritize his shop on the way off world. He's a bit of a hoarder and a bit of a flipper. What's one robot's junk is another's treasure, or something like that. ",
