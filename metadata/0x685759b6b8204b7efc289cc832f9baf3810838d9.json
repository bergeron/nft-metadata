    "description": "The first time rays appeared. The rays are an explorative way to find the painting, not only the figures underneath but also the meaning they hold in the abstract. Rays are drawn to show many ideas of; physical energy, the pieces we leave of ourselves for others to find, and the metaphysical relation between viewer and the piece used to draw in the viewerâ€™s gaze. Used as both a compositional framing device and a vessel, the rays bind yet simultaneously free the figures from the surface of the window the artwork resides in. (Painted in Procreate, late 2022).",
