    "description": "The “Paradise Lost” EP is about the battle between good and evil. Up until this track in the project, I tended to lean on the side of good, or at least acknowledge we’re trying to do the right thing. “Stay Away” is the moment I become the darkness. Carried by piercing synths and distorted production, the lyrics tell a story of the villain and provide a glimpse into the other side of heaven.",
