    "description": "Morris had seen incredible success since joining the NFT space. He managed to catch an early influencer wave, quit his IRL job, and venture out into the new Web3 world he found himself in. Relishing in the success of his decision making, and ease of the NFT market, he broke his lease and rented a cabin in Washington State. Here he could live his life without fear of his love for suspenders and pink ties. Alas, Morris got REKT by a surprise AirDrop of his favorite project Miscommunicating Mice. The slow internet of his secluded cabin didnâ€™t allow him to see the DO NOT CLICK just below the link and his gains were gone. Running out of the cabin Morris Misclick Moose rushed through the woods to build his empire back once more.",
