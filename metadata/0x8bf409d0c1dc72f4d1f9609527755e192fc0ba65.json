    "description": "\"Dear divine beings, hear my prayer. As the goddess of the sea, I long to explore the land, soar through the sky like the birds, and gaze upon the stars in the void. Grant me the strength and wisdom to protect the ocean and its inhabitants, and to appreciate the beauty of all life. May I fulfill my role in nurturing life in the sea while wandering freely among the sky and stars. May your grace always be with me, and lead me forward. Thank you for your blessings and guidance.\"\n\n(We need fantasy to survive because reality is too difficult.)\n1/1 edition\n6000*3500 pixels",
