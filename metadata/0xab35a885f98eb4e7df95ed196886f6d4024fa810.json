    "description": "When I stand in a flower field, fading into the distant horizon, the beauty of the flowers unconsciously attracts my attention to the blue sky above that is in fact dark and never-ending. These two points of view ( below and above the horizon line ) convey both senses of beauty and awe that are present in all my observations, in a way that in each encounter with any kind of beauty vis-Ã -vis its inherent sense of fear and awe, it is destroyed and reconstructed in an eternal cycle.",
