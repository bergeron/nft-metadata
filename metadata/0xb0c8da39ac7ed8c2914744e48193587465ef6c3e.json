    "description": "The artwork \"Demons inside\" was drawn many years ago during my \"fun\" youth. In those days, I suffered from anorexia nervosa and depression and exhausted myself physically and mentally every day. The picture conveys all the pain and despair, as well as the killing thoughts and feelings that cover a person who has problems with mental health and psyche.  \nThe picture is painted in oil on canvas, has been finalized with color in CSP.",
