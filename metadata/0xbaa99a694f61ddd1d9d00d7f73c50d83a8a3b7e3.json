    "description": "Mis Flores Artificiales is a series of turning the camera upon oneself as a self healing journey of trust and inner peace. \n\nNorma Córdova’s image based work creates illusions that conjure the realms of the imagination without presenting a factual reality. They intersect femininity, self identity, and wonder. \n\nIn moody, narrative-driven compositions, Cordova explores desire and desirability, and question the myriad expectations of women and how we are portrayed. \n",
