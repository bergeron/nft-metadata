    "description": "When I was a teenager, I read a poem by Molana Rumi \"Where did I come from, what was the purpose of my coming?\"\nThis question challenged me to create images in my mind for our first home\nAnywhere except earth, where gravity and time have no meaning\nWhere we all sprouted individually but were actually one!\nA place where there was no need for soil to germinate\nWe were not human and we were not animals! While we had both of them\nWe were not God and we were not slaves! But we had both of them\nWe are travelers!\n\n\n",
