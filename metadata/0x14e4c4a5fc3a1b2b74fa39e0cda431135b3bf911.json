    "description": "In January 2022 there was an event at Record Plant, a studio in Los Angeles, that chillpill hosted to help onboard artists onto web3. A few of us snuck into the control room and made this song. Naturally, people would hear the bass through the wall and slowly leave the live room where the event was to see what was going on. The night ended with 40+ people crowded around the computer blasting the finished version. That is how our year started so we thought it made sense for it to also be how we wrap it up. \n\nWe had Jon Kupper step up to help us with the intro and outro. KAJÉ went crazy on the beat with chillpill. & I recorded in front of more people than I have in my life. \n\nHope you blast this at your NYE party, web3 gets it first.",
