    "description": "Daniela Crow (@Danielacutre) wrote me months ago to collaborate, thank you for giving me this opportunity Daniela! I dedicate this series to the Africans I crossed on dusty roads, to those who returned from the border when migration subdued them... to the European who one day asked me for a coin to pay the bus and go to attend homeless children without receiving a salary... to the musicians who joined our celebration drinking macerated corn. and I dedicate it to you who believed in me in 2017 and told me that we would be huge.  love you all <3\n",
