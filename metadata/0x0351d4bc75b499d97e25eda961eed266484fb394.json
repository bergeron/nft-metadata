    "description": "Hey web3, I’m Harry and this is my first drop on sound.xyz. I’ve been making music for the past 10 years and over that time I’ve released music in EDM, Hip Hop, Alternative, Indie and Pop genres. With HARRY WAS HERE, my most recent project, I’ve aimed to be as experimental and honest as possible, combining all of my past styles into one genre-less sound. I write, produce, record, mix and master all of my own stuff and love the process of curating everything down to the last detail. When music NFTs started to become a thing, I immediately saw the potential shifts they could have on the music industry, one that leaves most of us artists barely able to sustain a full-time career. I’m incredibly excited to continue using the platform to explore new avenues to get my art out there and connect with people I otherwise wouldn’t be able to reach.\n\n“Heaven Or Hell” is probably the most unconventional track I’ve ever made. The lyrics were adapted from a poem “Last Words” by my grandfather William S. Kilborne and touch on the struggles between good and evil within one’s own conscience. I made this song with the rest of the EP in December 2021 during two straight weeks of rain in Los Angeles, which very much influenced the melancholy atmosphere. The song further questions if we’re being judged by a higher power and whether or not our triumphs and regrets mean anything in a universe so vast and unresponsive. I’m so grateful for the feedback I’ve received on this project and inspired to keep creating things that push the boundaries of my music and the industry we all exist in.",
