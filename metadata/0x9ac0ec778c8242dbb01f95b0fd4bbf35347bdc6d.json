    "description": "Year 3000, Moon, praying to the stars. \n\n“Silver Waves” represents a desperate pursue of freedom by showing the prayer of a girl raising her hands up to the sky.\nWith this gesture she expresses her desire for independence, for herself and for her birthplace, the Moon, now destroyed and exploited. \nShe has nothing left but hope and prayers, and these will last forever.",
