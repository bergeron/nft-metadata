    "description": "EDITION 1 OF 1\n\nTitle: Synthetic Print  \nArtist: Godwits \nYear: 2021-2022\n\nSynthetic Print is a modern abstract art collection of 300 digital printing-press style works by Godwits. This collection took 1 year and 6 months to complete. Godwits is the first to design colored pixelated boxes of this kind and present it as a signature artwork.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Godwits experimented with woodcuts, etching, engraving on metal, and silk screen printing. Reminiscing about the great times in the 90s, Godwits started to plan this project in 2021 to experiment in the areas in industrial design, generative art, graphic design and contemporary art.\n\nPublished by: Abstract Art Labs  \nContract By: Manifold Studios  \nContract Type: ERC-721  \nArtist Royalty: 5%\n\nEach artwork in this collection is an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) on Ethereumâ€™s blockchain.
