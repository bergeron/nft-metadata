    "description": "Looking in and out\nby Dave Paddick\n\nLooking through the doorways of an old abandoned house. The roof and ceiling have been compromised letting daylight shine in from above illuminating the plaster on the floor. This view no longer exists. This once stately home is no longer with us. RIP It was torn down spring 2018 and the land cleared to increase the acreage for more crops.  \n\nPhotography by Phos³\n\nWe are Kathryn and Dave, we are a husband and wife team, life partners and soul mates. Together we publish our photography under one name \"Photography by Phos3\", and put our name on our art. Our home is South Western Ontario, Canada but \"The World is our studio!\"\n\nTheir passion is photography. You'll often find them driving down country roads photographing storm, abandoned places, wildlife and whatever else catches their eyes.\n\nLight  ∙  Vision  ∙  Emotion\n",
