    "description": "Each Ancient Genesis Box contains one Momo, a magical creature that can be fused to your Holoself during Momoguro: Legends of Uno gameplay. At least one Momo is required for all in-game quests, with each attached Momo boosting your avatarâ€™s stats and abilities. The Momos inside each Ancient Genesis Momo Box are limited edition 1/1s that will only be available during this drop. These Momos are rarer and more powerful than those found in the Genesis Momo Boxes, and have varying types (regular or mega), stats, and skills. Ancient Genesis Momo Boxes are available exclusively to Ancient Holoself holders, with each holder receiving one box for each Ancient Holoself they currently hold, per the snapshot on March 22, 2023.",
