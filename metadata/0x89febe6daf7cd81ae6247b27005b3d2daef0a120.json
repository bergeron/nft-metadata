    "description": "*Created for the avril15 S3 fan art competition*\n\nGuadian Angel - XQS128, explorer of the universe who always brings her trusty teddy sidekick Quinn along with her on adventures\n\nThis piece is actually very meaningful to me as it represents my youngest daughter Xoe. She really loves stuffed animals and is quite the little explorer.  The wings on her teddy bear are symbolic of the day she was born. My partner had to have an emergency c-section, and because of complications our Xoe had to be airlifted to the NICU right after she was born.  The nurses gave us a teddy bear to hold onto until we could see her. It was a very scary time, but thankfully everyting went well and Xoe made a full recovery, and is a happy healthy little angel. ",
