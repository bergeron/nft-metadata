    "description": "I went there in the evening. The sun is almost setting It's a beautiful light time which makes the details of the temple beautiful.\n\nWat Phra Si Sanphet was the holiest temple on the site of the old Royal Palace in Thailand's ancient capital of Ayutthaya until the city was completely destroyed by the Burmese in 1767. It was the grandest and most beautiful temple in Ayutthaya, Thailand.",
