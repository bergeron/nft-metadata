    "description": "This collection is inspired by the women of the hill tribes in Northern Thailand. They are encountering everyday hardship never experienced nor ever recognized by the majority of the population of South East Asia. But their communities, families and cultural heritage gives them the power go through the life with the dignity and pride. One of the features of their ethnic identity are their national costumes, decorated with jewelry and vivid embroidery. Using unique techniques UmaLu brings the hill tribes costumes live to canvas. She captures the strong characters of these women and the essence of their colorful traditional garment. Her choice of motifs and techniques are the perfect match for her intention to honor these strong women and their traditional way of life.",
