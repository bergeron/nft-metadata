    "description": "You enter the dimly lit space filled with vintage arcade cabinets, classic console systems, and retro memorabilia adorning the walls. The air is thick with your minds sounds of beeping, buzzing, and the clack of buttons as players battle for high scores and bragging rights. You pick the controller up…You’re exactly where you should be in this moment. \n\nIntroducing The Game Room by Fuzzlabz. The genesis game, BLURMAN, features exciting gameplay mechanics such as seasons, loyalty, points, boxes, and broken sea ghosts. \n\nOwning BLURMAN is the gateway to exclusive updates, high score contests, other nostalgic games, burn to redeems, and rewards from the DoomOnFire crew.  Treat each token like an individual arcade token, as certain gameplay and Game Room redeemables may require different burn amounts. \n\nLet the games begin.",
