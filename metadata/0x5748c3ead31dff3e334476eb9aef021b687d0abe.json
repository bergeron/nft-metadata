    "description": "/zirg weh/ - noun\n\nthe feeling of hopelessness one feels after trying multiple, different life and career paths and still not knowing what to do with one's life..\n\n//\n\nPresented here is a digital version of a 9x9 Polaroid collage that encompasses a total of 81 instant pictures. These 81 photographs were meticulously and professionally scanned, colour corrected and digitally arranged within Photoshop to emulate the true analog iteration of this piece.\n\nIt is my hope that this work finds a special home with a collector who understands and appreciates the magic, scarcity and brilliance behind the tangibility of a Polaroid picture.\n\nI'd like to thank Foundation for being able to mint such a unique and special piece of photographic art on their platform, as well as to anyone who happens to take the time to view and interpret it; but ultimately I would like to thank the collector who sees value in my work, my art and furthermore potential in my artistic abilities.\n\n- Get in touch via Twitter",
