Generative Art by AndrBel, this is the first collection of generative art in math formulas and code from artist-designer AndrBel. AndrBel gives the owner the right to mint their Gen GiMoPu from the collection generated by <Generative Art by AndrBel> - www.AndrBel.art Generative art by AndrBel Art. You will be presented with a series of works of generative art, combining the space of thinking-vision of the artist, connected in the code of programming and artificial intelligence. These compounds will be reflected in my Gerative Art collections under the general name - Gen.",
