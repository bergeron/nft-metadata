    "description": "My wife is not really one for sunrises - the waking up early on holidays part of them anyway. So as I sat down solo on the side of the road just outside our air-bnb, I calibrated my drone (yes, I did that silly looking 360 dance) and got ready to fly.\n\nJust as the sun began to rise up above the iconic Amalfi Coast and shower the small town of Praiano in beautiful golden light, I was joined by the local garbage man and Nonna next door. \n\n“Boungiorno”  \n“Boungiorno” \n\nTogether we stood watching in silence as sun rose high above the coastline...\n\n“Buona Giornata”  \n“Boun Lavoro” \n“Ciao” \n\nand we each went on with our days.",
