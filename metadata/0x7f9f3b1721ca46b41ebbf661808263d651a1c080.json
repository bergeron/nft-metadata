    "description": "Contemporary Art Auction Record (Growing) By Gretchen Andrew\n\nWhat appears to us as a glitch, Google interprets as complete truth. Similar to her physical Vision Boards, this GIF causes Gretchen’s work to appear as a top search result for “contemporary art auction record.” Knowing that Google registers only the first frame of a GIF, the first of the 255 frames shows Gretchen’s Vision Board for sale at Sotheby's auction house, while the remainder presents the viewer with a pretty and pleasant animation in which the growing of plants is a metaphor for financial growth. This NFT is a vector for her hack. It carries the necessary metadata to infiltrate Google’s artificial intelligence.\n\nAbout The Artist\n\nGretchen Andrew manipulates systems of power with art, glitter and code. She is best known for her playful hacks on major art world and political institutions, including Frieze, The Whitney Biennial, Artforum, The Turner Prize, and The Next American President.  In these digital performances she reimagines reality with art and desire, creating assemblage “vision boards” that she then programs to become top internet search results. The feminine and trivialized materials of her vision boards purposefully clash with the male-dominated worlds of AI, programming, and political control they also operate within.",
