It is a thoughtful work that combines the elements of arts, science, history and a bit of mystery that turned into a whole painting series. Each NFT was created to dive deeper into the Mana Lina character, which represents strong women and advocates women empowerment. From painting to NFT, the Mana Lina collection marks a new benchmark in NFT creation.\n\nDigital Sale Only.",
