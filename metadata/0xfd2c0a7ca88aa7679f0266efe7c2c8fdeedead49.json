    "description": "Jim Bianco is the Head of Bianco Research. He’s our go-to source on macro analysis from someone who knows crypto. He always gives us a pragmatic take. \n\nJim was early and loud about the initial Fed pivot into rising interest rates, all the way back in March of 2022, before much of the crypto industry really understood how significant interest rates can be. In this episode, he discusses the Balaji $1M BTC bet, the state of the financial system, and answers whether or not the banks are insolvent (or just unprofitable).\n\nArtwork generated from the timestamp [37:00 - 37:23] “Let me put this in Balaji terms - I agree Balaji $1M dollars for Bitcoin and I agree in 90…but maybe not days, maybe it’s weeks, maybe it’s months, maybe it’s quarters, but it’s not going to be 90 days. It’s going to occur a lot slower, but it will occur overtime.” \n\n10% of proceeds go to Biancoresearch.eth",
