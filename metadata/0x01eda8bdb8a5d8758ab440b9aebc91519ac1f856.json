    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful woman named Cassandra. She lived in ancient Greece, and was admired by many, including the god Apollo.\n\nApollo was smitten with Cassandra and sought to win her love by giving her the gift of seeing the future. Cassandra was tempted by the gift and promised Apollo her favors in return.\n\nBut after receiving the gift, Cassandra went back on her word, and refused to be with Apollo. Enraged, Apollo couldn't take back the gift of prophecy, but he added a curse to it. From that day forward, nobody would believe Cassandra's prophecies, no matter how true they were.\n\nDespite this curse, Cassandra continued to make predictions about the future, but her warnings were always ignored. She foresaw the fall of Troy and the death of Agamemnon, but her words fell on deaf ears.\n\nIn the end, Cassandra's curse became her legacy, and she was remembered as a tragic figure, who had the gift of prophecy but was never believed.",
