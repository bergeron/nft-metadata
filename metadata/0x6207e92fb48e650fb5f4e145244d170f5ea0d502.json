    "description": "“There is no birth of consciousness without pain.”\n-Carl Jung\n\n Within No One and Nowhere, within a cloud of pain and sorrow that I’ve been carrying for thousands of years, I close my eyes. Through the chaos of my thoughts, a voice invites me to silence. A green cedar with the height of the sky, opens my heart and breaks my thousand-year-old tears and a light with the touch of love and hope, lays a kiss on my wounds and then I turn green again, green, greener than ever.\n.\nOil on Canvas /48x36 in\nToronto /2016",
