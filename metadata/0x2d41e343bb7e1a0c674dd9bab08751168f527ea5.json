    "description": "Underwater is a collection of unique artworks fueled by creativity and technology. Using a combination of custom machine learning and generative algorithms, a world of underwater sea creatures was created that are truly one-of-a-kind. Each piece is natively presented in vector format, defined by mathematical equations rather than pixel data. The art can be scaled to any size without losing quality, making it suitable for a wide range of viewing formats.",
