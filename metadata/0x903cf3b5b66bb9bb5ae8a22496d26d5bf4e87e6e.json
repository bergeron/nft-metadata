    "description": "Underneath the word I live in there’s a place where anxiety and disappointment built a castle and live in chaos , you can feel but you can’t see.\n\nConstantly hear the voices inside of your head you turn around and it’s just nothing there.\nDon’t worry it’s just a glitch of humankind.\nStart myself in the mirror for just one second I can see freaks through my eye hand to hand dancing.\nWelcome to my brain.\nI can feel my hands getting wet and burning , mirror is not there anymore.\nMirror mirror on the wall tell no more lies of who we are.",
