    "name": "The shiny HAMADA S",
    "description": "December 10, 2019, Hamada S, a freighter flying the flag of Togo, is at anchor off Bizerte (Tunisia). It arrived 2 days earlier from Bejaia (Algeria). Its commander claims he is expected at the Menzel Bourguiba repair yard. Access to the port is forbidden to him after the refusal by the commander to pay for the services of a tug which would allow him to safely cross the bridge of Bizerte and the channel of the port.\nDuring the night, Hamada S drags on its anchors and runs aground on Rimel beach. Supervised by the maritime and regional authorities, the available tugs were busy in the following days trying to refloat the cargo and tow it to the shipyard. Hamada S is clear but heels a little further on a rocky bottom. Initially, the 11 sailors are confined on board, they were evacuated on January 7, 2020.\nHamada S remains planted in front of the beach.\n\nPiece Details\nWhat : Hamada S cargo ship built in 1977 in Izmir (Turkey)\nWhen : 05/03/2022 at 07:32 AM\nWhere : Rimel rocky beach",
