    "description": "I live on the Scottish coast, and sights like this are always my favourite. Looking out across to the Isle of Arran, I was watching the sun set from a cliff. The sea was glimmering in the sunlight and the beam of light stretched from the islands all the way to the base of the cliff I was on - it was mesmerising. \n\n\nWhen I look back on this photo, I am reminded of the calming feeling that sunsets bring to me. Particulary at this time of year, when the weather is wet and dark and the sunsets are few and far between, I enjoy looking back and remembering how these scenes make me feel. ",
