    "description": "Bloody Milk is my reflection on the work our psyche performs behind the curtain of our daily lives; perceiving and absorbing violence of all sorts, shapes and forms that we encounter: the media, toxic behaviour, hate and plain old-fashioned physical assault. The tension accumulated through all those sources of violence cannot be relieved even when we're feeling safe.",
