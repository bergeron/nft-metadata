    "name": "Sebastião Salgado - Amazônia: Tree of Life",
    "description": "Brilliantly conceived and masterfully crafted over the course of five months, Tree of Life immerses viewers in the Brazilian rainforest. With its dense foliage and compound broad leaves, the hero of Salgado’s lush forest is the Aldina latifolia. Photographed in 2009 at Jaú River, Jaú National Park, Amazonas State, Brazil, the Aldina tree is native to the wet tropical biome of Brazil’s Amazonia. \n\nCapturing the best of Salgado’s artistic vision from his five-decade career, Tree of Life transcends documentation and offers a breathtaking view into the region – personal and yet larger than life – and inspiring quiet awe throughout.\n\nAccompanied by a physical print signed by the artist.",
