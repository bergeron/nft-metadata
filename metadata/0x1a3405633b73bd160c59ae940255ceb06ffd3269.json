My parents emigrated from quiet villages in Ireland and Italy to Ellis Island in the 1950s, to discover upon arrival of the sensory overload of New York City.\n\n“NYC” — the first destination this Roam collection — captures that cacophony and my love of the city. \n\nCollectors, thank you for considering this collage that promises legacy — NYC will never go dark.\n\n1/1\n3000px x 4000px\n300dpi jpg",
