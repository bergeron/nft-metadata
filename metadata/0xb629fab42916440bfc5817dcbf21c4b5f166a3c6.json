    "description": "Tangerine Dream is an ode to my hometown, Boston. This song represents how the place where I grew up has amplified my drive and helped me dream bigger as I rise as an independent musician.  \n\nWhen I wrote the record in 2018, I had never done an overseas show or traveled for my music before. I had hardly any streams but still felt confident that my music would take me around the world one day. Fast forward to 2023, I've done 40+ shows in both the US and Europe and have performed in front of thousands of people. I can easily attribute the manifestation of those experiences to the lyrics written and performed in this song.\n\nAs I write this, Tangerine Dream has amassed 2.9 million streams on Spotify alone. It’s an accomplishment that I can proudly say was achieved with no marketing, no management, and no label. \n\nStill independent. Still chasing the highest of heights. I hope this song brings as much magic into your life as it has mine.\n\nProduced by Massachusetts native Mozado.\n",
