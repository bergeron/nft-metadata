    "name": "“Metamorphosis” by Alister Benn",
    "description": "When we engage in a moment we gain insight into its qualities, its nature, and its influence. Each image is a meditation, bringing depth of meaning and understanding to us in the quiet recess of our mind. Thoughts, visions, and ideas emerge from the darkness, revealing quiet beauty in the shadows of reflection.   \n\nAlister Benn is a professional photographer, writer, educator, and musician. He runs his company Expressive Photography with his wife, Norwegian Artist, Ann Kristin Lindaas. Alister is a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and his passion is in the therapeutic and developmental strengths of creative expression.\n\nThis NFT is part of the 1st collection of “The Landscapers Collective”, the very first collective completely dedicated to landscape photography, featuring the most talented landscape photographers of the world and most promising artists of the whole NFT space. Many countries, cultures, and languages are represented here, all teamed up around a common project: bringing to the world the best of our beautiful nature through our art.\n\nDate: 2013  \n\nLocation: UK  \n\nArtist: Alister Benn  ",
