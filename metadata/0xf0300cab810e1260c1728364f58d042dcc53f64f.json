    "description": "Story\nIt had started when I wanted to create just a masterpiece.  And the masterpiece is sure impossible to be done just in a short time.  If you are so skilled at drawing, you may be able to create lots of artworks by not taking much time, but not with this artwork.  This artwork was created by drawing a small and short line stroke after stroke until it became this picture.  The number total strokes made is 232,347 strokes.  This is the different value that I had always been expected!  According to what I’ve mentioned above, this artwork is my true patience and devotion.\n\nConcept of the Artwork\nThis picture was inspired by the artwork of Leonardo da Vinci’s Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The picture tells the story about when Mary, the Blessed Virgin was expecting Jesus by the blessing of the god. The creator presents the story through Pepe, the Frog character in order to make this artwork unique.\n\nDetails\nTotal Number of Strokes: 232,347 \nCreating Duration: 287hrs",
