    "description": "When all seems lost, when all seems troubled, when all seems hopeless, there will always be light in the darkness.\n\nLight and Shadow is the only multiple edition of the collection \"Human Canvas\" currently available on Foundation.  \nHuman Canvas is a combination of classical painting and self-portrait photography. It is a reinterpretation of classical works with my own sensibility and vision. My body serves as a canvas for both the painting and the feelings that come out of it. \n\nA self-portrait photography mixed with Théodore Géricault, The Raft of the Medusa, 1818–1819.",
