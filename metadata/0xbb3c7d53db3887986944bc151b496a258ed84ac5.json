    "description": "This is a series of contemporary music in which letters and numbers are encrypted according to the rules established by mera takeru, according to the height and length of the notes. The information hidden in the encrypted music is confidential, precious, and most of all, beautiful. How wonderful that they are inscribed on the blockchain. And the artwork was created by boldly deforming the score of the music. The decoding table can be viewed by scanning the QR code in the work.",
