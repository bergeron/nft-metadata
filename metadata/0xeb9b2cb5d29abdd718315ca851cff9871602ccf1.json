    "name": "THE ARTISAN'S RESOLVE ",
    "description": "This piece was birthed from memories from a very lengthy phase of my life where there was a lot of self doubt, intense  feeling of lack of purpose.\n  I tried to venture into other things which were considered to be of \"more value\" by a society that never rated art. They didn't give me enough time for my craft but I never stayed for so long, my art always called back to me. I never regarded monetary value,  i just wanted to do the one thing that truly made me feel happy,  zen. \n   Ever since the works of my hands began to get acknowledged this past year, by fellow artists and non-artists through social media, like an olive branch, my inner peace has been handed to me. I will not be gaslighted into believing the end to my efforts will forever be futile anymore .\n  Souls resonate with my art and that has  plunged me into an ocean of euphoria. \n   The flames of creativity have been fanned and they'll forever burn bright. \n   I'd be a hollow shell for the rest of my days, if I ever let go.",
