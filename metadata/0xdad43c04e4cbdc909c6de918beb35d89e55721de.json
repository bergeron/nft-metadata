    "description": "Once upon a day a great King who had never experienced loveØŒ left the kingdom for hunting. On the way back, he met a maid and falls in love with her. But when the maid arrives at the king's palace, she falls ill. The king gathers the sages from all over the country and offers a great reward for the treatment of the girl.\nAll promised the treatment with confidence, but their efforts became in vain and the girl becomes more ill.\nDisappointed with the treatment, the king goes to the mosque and prays, and asks God for help. While crying and praying, he falls asleep and dreams that a wise sage comes to him and heals the maid and his wish is fulfilled. The king returns to the palace and waits until dawn. In the morning he sees someone coming towards the palace through the woods.",
