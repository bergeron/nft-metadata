They live according to the climatic conditions, follow the sheep, migrate from season to season.\n\nIn the last few days of winter, they get active, slowly take their flocks out of the winter quarters and start grazing.\n\nThey stay where there is grassland and follow the sparkle of the water. The water flows down from high, while the rams rise to higher heights against the current.  \n",
