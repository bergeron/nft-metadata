    "description": "The first prototype of floppy disk.\nNow and forever captured.\n\nAn innocent-looking cartridge, that was used to contain confidential government information collected by a secret organisation called \"Signal\" in the 1960's. (2.2Mb)\n\nThis cartridge was one of the first prototypes in the world, and only people with the compatible machine could decrypt it, and therefore read it. In short, a real pandora's box which almost nobody could find a use for at that time.\n\nRumour has it that the \"Signal\" organisation itself conceptualised and manufactured it. (but this remains as a rumour)",
