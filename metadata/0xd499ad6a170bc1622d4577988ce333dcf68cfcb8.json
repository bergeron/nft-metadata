    "name": "Unconscious Musing ",
    "description": "In a neo-classical style, Unconscious Musing delivers a totally deconstructed scene: an open-air museum with distended perspectives where elements of museum scenography, works of art, ghostly allegories and a mountainous landscape in the background are intermingled. The order, the symmetry, and the prominence of the Antique disappears in favor of the imaginary, the freedom of the spirit and the unconscious. Here we are in the heart of an artist's dream. In the manner of the representations of the dreams of yesteryear, I try to personify the action of dreaming through this Greco-Roman dreamer and illustrates the intellectual path that leads to complete a work. The collection of inspirations and ideas accumulated during the day gives way to fanciful, chimerical, utopian, even romantic assemblages during sleep, a true nod to the Renaissance 2.0.\n\nMake me dream, with Funghi Gallery",
