    "description": "The story behind Grumpy Bear Town goes back a few years . The first (OLD) Grumpy Bear in Town was just an ordinary bear . This naked bear without clothes and accessories exists only once in the NFT Collection . All his offspring are diverse and have different traits. There are bears that are common and bears that are rare. In addition, there is a bear, which visits our collection from the future universe.",
