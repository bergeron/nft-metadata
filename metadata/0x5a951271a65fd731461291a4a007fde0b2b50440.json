    "description": "When I started making her she was meant to be mischievous with a smirk on her face and a glimmer in her eye. It was an attempt to make my work not look as sad. But someone made me mad one night and I removed her smile, only to realize she was evolving with me in real time. Why was I fighting my gut with that smile? Why did I want so bad to put it on her when I knew that wasn’t how I felt? The emotion overwhelmed me in a glorious way. Being mad in that moment made us both come to life that day. She began to turn into who she is now - a strong force fueled by madness in more ways than one, eager to harness the newfound strength and tear down anything trying to stop her. We are one in the same. That was the day I chose her title song, a song that helped frame my perception of beauty at a young age watching The Crow on repeat. Its opening lyrics flashed in in my head like a neon sign. “I am the new way to go. I am the way of the future”\n\nMusical inspiration: https://youtu.be/aF4hyVArBDc",
