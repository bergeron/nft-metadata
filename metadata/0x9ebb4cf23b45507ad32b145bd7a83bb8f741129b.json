    "description": "The world of Crypto coins as a Token has been making a series of ups and downs.\n\n\" since I entered the world of Crypto Art, it has been my perception and I wanted to illustrate in some way this tension and contraction of the Blockchain\"\n\nWe move to the time of the dinosaurs and their animal survival instinct. Several details can be observed, and this connection with the ETH logo and the body that inhabits, bleeding but is still high and bright, so this link with emotions can be observed within each individual who is involved in this last dinner,\n\nAnd now I'm asking you, will this be the last dinner?",
