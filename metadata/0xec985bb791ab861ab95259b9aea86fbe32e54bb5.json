    "name": "Matchbox 01: Golden Langur",
    "description": "With a small dark face framed by a halo of gold hair, the Golden langur gets its common name from its striking colours - a luscious coat of deep cream to stunning gold that reddens in the winter. However, along the Himalayas, the Bhotiya locals know it by a different name - Sugrib. \n\nThe legend of Sugrib (Sanskrit: सुग्रीव, sugrīva), is known from South to Southeast Asia. The ancient legend describes his exile to the mountains where he quietly lived before returning as the king of the monkey kingdom. This shy and quiet langur is native to the evergreen and moist deciduous forests found in Western Assam, India and in the foothills of the Black Mountains of Bhutan.\n\nScientific Name: Trachypithecus geei\nLocal Name (Dialect): Sugrib (Bhotia)\nLocation: Bhutan; India",
