    "description": "10 years ago, I learned a lot about head anatomy, mechanics, languages, zoology, even poetry. But none of them I finished, the only thing that finished was the answer of ''what do I really like?\" Well, I like the beauty of brain structure, the complexity of machines, the uniqueness of language and the feeling of poetry. Since then I started collecting beautiful pictures, complex, structured things and feelings into 1 picture without knowing that technique was called Collage.\n\nAnd what you see now is the contents of my head when I was young which I poured into a collage that was made on January 9th and finished on January 14th.\n\n\nThis collage is 100% handmade. Uses 7 editions of NatGeo and 1 sheet from Westminster Abbey book.\n\nSize 25 x 24 cm\n¬©2023 izithr",
