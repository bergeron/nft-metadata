    "description": "No sleep \nLocation: Jacksonville Beach, FL \nDate: September 13, 2021\nSize: 8 x 10 \n\nDescription: This painting is similar to Chaos because it is a rough draft art piece. It shows a brown figure who can be depicted as a tan man, which is me (Prince Diggs). I am going through a series of games while being away from home. I am in a new state with new acquaintances and new neighbors. The one thing they all have in common is trying to figure me out. The game resembles tic tac toe or connects the dots. It also depicts a bloody spot bulge at the top left of the 8 x 10 canvas. This has a lot to do with the phrase “blood, sweat, and tears.” I was working a lot to get to the point of moving away from California but followed up with all the hard work, sacrifices, and suffering of figuring out this new estranged place. I wasn’t myself and felt that I was figuring out new depths of a new home that was not close in the alignment of my goals, values, and lifestyle choices. It was an easy adjustment ",
