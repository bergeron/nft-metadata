    "description": "I seek to paint figures that suffer as inconvenience a situ of tireless seeking \nnon beings reminiscent of feelings\nimages suffocating from vastness \nremaining still and alone\nfigures that recede into spaces \nnot unlike memory in proximity with shadows cast in cold light and voluminous \nnondescript textures figures attempting \nto avoid identification presenting human contexts and anatomical insinuation \nwith geological indications shapes are of nature emergent and inevitable\nlost in continuums of time \nand space figures possessed by presence \nin a vacuum with untitled tendencies\nappearing with traces of a name suggesting namelessness attempting to compose a decomposition to halt a procession to be within from a distance\nbiological and anthropological \nand still manifest as assemblage\nfigures born into arbitrary dying from certainty toward uncertainty presenting a limited view of a limiting relationship \nwith solitude",
