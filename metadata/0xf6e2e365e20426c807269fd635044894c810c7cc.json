    "description": "Star Gazing is a piece inspired by Malibu Joe. With this piece I aim to epitomize not just the beauty of these heavenly bodies, but also the unconscious envy we have towards it. We crave an escape; from pain and suffering, from anxiety and also the weight that comes with gravity. Deep in our thoughts We fantasize about floating in our own space, we dream of a life high above us, to touch the clouds, walk the moon and reach the stars. But we are engrossed within the confines of reality.\nDespite it all, this painting depicts a man who has found a means to elevating his thoughts as he dreams lucidly of worlds that exists outside of his. However temporal, this man has found a way to defy laws of physics, to live without the pull of the earth and to simply... float. In that moment as he looks up and gazes at the stars there isnâ€™t any envy in his heart because now he knows his had become one with them.\n\nThis NFT comes with a hand signed 19x24\" canvas shipped to your address",
