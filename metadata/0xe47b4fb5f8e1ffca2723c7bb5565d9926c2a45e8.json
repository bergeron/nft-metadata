Just like the tens of thousands of Kurdish families who migrated west in the 1990s.\nThe title of the documentary, REŞ, means black in Kurdish.One of the workers said, 'Our work is black, but our foreheads are white'.This word means that they are honest and honorable people.\n©Serkan Çolak\nHis projects deals with different topics such as urbanization process and focus on issues around cultural diversity,mmigration,political issues and human rights in Turkey",
