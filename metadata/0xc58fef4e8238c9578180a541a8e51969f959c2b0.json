    "name": "The Sunset Fisherman",
    "description": "Cevlik cliff in Hatay city, which is located in the southern part of Turkey today,  consists of lots of huge rocks where many fishermen try to fish. Fishermen who pursue their passion in stormy days, continue to fish regardless of the giant waves, risking their lives. This is how a fisherman standing on a rock in the cliff under the sunset light is reflected in my frame on such a stormy day while the silky waves hitting the rocks.\n\nThis photo was published in National Geographic Turkey August 2015 issue, and in 2016 it  won the 1st prize in  Turkey Mersin Chamber of Shipping International Photography Contest .\n In addition, this photo was the cover photo of the September 2018 issue of AnadoluJet magazine, one of the Turkey's biggest airlines company.\n\nhttps://www.anadolujet.com/documents/uploads/eylul-2018.pdf\n\nArtist: Meriç Aktar\nCamera: Nikon D610\nLens: Nikkor AF-S 85mm f1.8\nDimensions: 5923 × 3954 – 13 MB\nResolution: 300 dpi ,24mpx\nLocation: Hatay,Turkey\nDate: 04/02/2015\n",
