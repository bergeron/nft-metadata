    "description": "Bigfoot, aka Sasquatch, the Abominable Snowman or Yeti, is a creature with a long history of blurry photos and video clips. Dramatically, these now include mysterious images from the Mars rover Spirit that look like such a creature reclining on a rock. These sightings captured my imagination because… what was Bigfoot doing on Mars? Was he from there? Was he loney? Would he ever return to Earth? Also, does this prove there’s hidden water on Mars? So many questions. I felt that AI had the answers. \n\nhttps://www.planetary.org/space-images/teeny-little-bigfoot-on-mars\nhttps://bigfootbase.com/news/bigfoot-mars-sighting-starsquatch\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/22931/the-return-of-little-bigfoot-on-mars/\nhttps://www.bigfootmap.com/\nhttps://www.livescience.com/most-famous-bigfoot-sightings",
