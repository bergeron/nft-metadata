    "description": "FINAL ARRIVAL is my genesis drop on Sound.xyz and I'm proud to be sharing the moment with my OG web3 collaborator Jadyn Violet. \n\nAbout myself, I've been working in the music industry for the past 15 years, initially as an audio engineer and now as a full time producer. At the beginning of 2022 I found my way into the web3 music scene and have been quietly following along ever since. I've made a lot of good friends in the space so far, many of whom are Artists I've been collaborating with, so stay tuned for more releases to come.\n\nFrom Jadyn -\nIt was super beautiful to work with James Chul Rim aka Chorus of the Forest once again. \n\nWe first connected in the middle of last year when we linked up for our track \"Sugar Sweet Girl\". Coming off of a huge writer's block, James' production style inspired me to finally write a track that meant a lot to me. It was amazing to see a lot of the Web3 community resonate with that track and it only made sense to come out with a follow up. \n\nI can summarize the essence of our collaboration by tying it straight to a dark, trap like sound that I feel is super unique. I got the chance to truly be uncomfortable with the song \"FINAL ARRIVAL\" in the best way possible and I'm so excited for everyone to listen to it!\n\n\n",
