    "description": "This photo is part of the PAINTEREYE-Theodora collection. She stretches her arms between two century-old fir trees (Abies alba). The arms extend the lines of the horizontal branches. The ground is covered with an fluorescent moss which also covers the bark of the trees. The nudity of the model responds to the intimacy of the place.\nThe PainterEye collection has a maximum of 100 NFTs. These are photos from the personal collection of the painter James Arax made with his muse and model THEODORA. In this collection most of the photos were taken in the painter's studio and forest - Dordogne valley in France. These photos are part of the artistic material that feeds the creation of James Arax.\n\nProperty:\nPlace of completion: Arax Forest-  Dordogne Valley France\nDate of completion : 2008-Sept\nSize file: 3888x2592px\nWight file: 7.8Mo\nCanon Eos 400D",
