    "description": "This oil painting on 30 x 40 cm canvas is a tribute to the famous post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh, in his own style. \"One of the most famous figures in the history of Western art\"\n\nThe painting has been varnished and I will be sent framed.  \n\nWORLDWIDE SHIPPING\n\nA digitally rendered, stylized pixel-art version of my painting in the NextEarth metaverse on a precious plot of land near The Hague (Netherlands). The fancy name of my work is: \"To the NextEarth\", referring to that the most popular web3 map-based metaverse is on its way to the moon! :)\nThe painting in three parts is currently not for sale on the marketplace. It will later be possible to merge the three pieces.  \n\nhttps://app.nextearth.io/lands/a6ca40ae-1637-4c24-84b8-77046687a037\nhttps://app.nextearth.io/lands/a3cf871b-d9d1-4559-a5e1-fd6ac77fb221\nhttps://app.nextearth.io/lands/f234e7cb-f45e-4e31-aafc-29da7cf80c09\n\nAfter purchasing the painting, its owner will be able to purchase the digital land on floor price.",
