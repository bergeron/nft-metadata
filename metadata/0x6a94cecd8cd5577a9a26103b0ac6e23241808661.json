    "description": "The word panic comes from the greek god Pan (meaning \"the whole, all the things\"), and pointed at  the fearful and ecstatic experience of the living whole as a fierce and devastating strenght, and the loss of identification that comes from it. This is also depicted in myths (Osiris, Orpheus, Dionysus and all macranthropy myths) and shaman traditions, as the dismemberement of the adept and the dispersion of his parts in the four corners of the universe.\n2480x3508@300ppi",
