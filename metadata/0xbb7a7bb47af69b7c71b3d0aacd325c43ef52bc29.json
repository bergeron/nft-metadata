    "description": "Love is like bondage. In addition to captivity, a little like rain. It is like raindrops that cannot return to the sky. You don't want to fall, but now you have to. You can't go back. Love is actually another name for being a prisoner.\n\nThis work won a prize as a result of a competition and met with art lovers at Dubai Finance Center for 2 weeks.",
