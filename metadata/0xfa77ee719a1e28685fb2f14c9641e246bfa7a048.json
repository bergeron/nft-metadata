    "description": "I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, \"Come and see!\" I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest. (Revelation 6:1-2)",
