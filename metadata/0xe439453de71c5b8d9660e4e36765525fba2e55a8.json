    "description": "Two worlds merging in a singular spot. A man-made road leading to untapped nature. This is symbolic of our relationship to the natural world. We created cities to remove ourselves, yet the draw to return always remains. The rising sun shines light onto this truth, exposing the absolute beauty of a world not yet forgotten. \n \nI should have been on the other side of this image that morning. Two injuries in our group forced us to give up on the expedition to the top of Half Dome. Instead we came here and the morning glow of the rising sun illuminated the area with an almost heavenly touch. This was where I was supposed to be, to take this image and to remind myself why the natural world is so important.",
