    "description": "It is a form of plant that exists on a planet with constantly changing gravitational flows. They exist in united colonies, floating endlessly in the air taking bizarre shapes and constantly changing color under the influence of temperature, different gases, and radiation of the stars surrounding the planet. Each colony goes through many cycles, migrating along the entire surface of the planet. In places where gravity weakens, plants put down \"roots\" and attach themselves to the planet's surface. There is still debate about the intelligence (collective intelligence) of AIXXA plants. They are listed as an inheritance of the Vtolmr planetary system and are protected by an intergalactic convention. Only 600 images of these plants were allowed, after which access to the planet was denied to all but the inhabitants of this planetary system. These images depict various forms, phases, and states of AIXXA plant colonies. Unfortunately, some of them are so rare that only a few specimens could be captured. It is believed that anyone who has such an image in their collection can draw endless inspiration from it because these plants are ascribed magical properties. But there is no scientific proof of it. Nevertheless, the hunt for these images by collectors has become legendary and has been described in many works of literature after the 34th century when they were released. This is the TBOA club's first on-chain project.",
