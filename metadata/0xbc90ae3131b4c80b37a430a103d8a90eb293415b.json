    "description": "I transformed fear, pain, and love into photography and art. By telling the stories of others, I have found my freedom, my purpose, and the real me.\n\nExperience, feel, realize and let go.\n\nInstead of finding the words to explain art, I leave my acts to tell stories by themselves. After all, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nCollection: Wild Soul vol.2\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nYear: 2022.\n\nBio: I'm Jelena from Croatia. I have been creating photographs under the pseudonym Bambii for ten years now. My work is mostly inspired by the connection between people and nature. I'm also exploring the definition of love, soul and life while learning to love and accept myself through self-portraits. I am focused on emotions and vibe. Through collaboration with other people, I'm working on a more open approach to life, breaking down barriers and opening the possibility of new knowledge and experiences necessary for the growth of the individual.",
