Seemingly unimportant and small, Yoda in my eyes is the ultimate underdog that works in the background and enables the Jedi to take their stand.\nThis is why I have chosen this unlikely hero as my #1, my first NFT ever.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; *Philipp Katzenberger*\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n**Bonus content**: \nHigh quality artist-signed art print [claimable](https://philippkatzenberger.de) by the first owner\n\t\n**Artwork specs**:\n3000 x 3000 px\nOrigin 2016-2022 Germany\n#1 of 1 pieces, #1 of 50 in [CryptoBeavers.club](https://cryptobeavers.club) series ",
