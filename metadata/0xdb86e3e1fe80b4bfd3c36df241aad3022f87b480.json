    "description": "From a small collection of sculptures, made in response to being scammed. Angie Taylor made this series of 1/1's to raise awareness of how scamming is killing Cryptoart. These were created and sold to raise funds to compensate for the losses incurred as a result of the scam. A few sculptures  were given as gifts to those who came to her immediate rescue when the scam happened",
