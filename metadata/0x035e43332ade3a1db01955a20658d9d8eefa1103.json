    "description": "Every week I sample the colours from my design work and then I digitally melt then remix them to form a new composition. The idea was inspired by End of Day Glass, where the remaining glass in traditional glass making would be used to create colourful and vibrant glassware.\nEach month I will take my 4 End of Week compositions and animate them to create an End of Month piece.",
