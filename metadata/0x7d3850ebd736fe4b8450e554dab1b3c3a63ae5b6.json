    "description": "\n\n\nWhen your country is less than three centuries old, the landmarks and monuments are still fresh, and it is hard to predict which totems or monuments will remain relevant over the years. When you have so recently erased the culture that was there before you arrived, the reset you impose comes at a price that is the lack of perspective for what is monumental and what will represent you in the future. \nBut how do you identify the symbolic place? How do you start building monuments and landmarks that will carry your culture and identity? How do you differentiate one city from another when, in perspective,  there are still such few individual stories around it to build historical meaning?\nIn Europe, the landmarks and monuments are now obsolete and anecdotic. There are too many and they belong to an ancient age that speaks from too far. Unlike in the USA, where monuments feel still fresh out of the oven, in Europe just the most iconic survive as viral selfies points.\nWith POP TOTEM I present a list of possible candidates for future relevant monuments that I found driving along the roads of the USA. \n",
