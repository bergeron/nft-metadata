    "description": "For a long time, humans have been hunting animals for several reasons, mostly for food and medicine.\n\nRecently, many animals have been having dwindling numbers, but not because they are killed for food but because they are used as trophies and their parts sold for a lot of money in the black market.\n\nOne continent that has suffered from poaching is Africa where the numbers of many of these exotic animals are dwindling in large numbers and it has caused many organizations to step in to help these animals and stop poaching worldwide.\n\nThis artwork talks about that.\nWhat if the roles were reversed?\nIt is sure that poachers wouldn't want this.\n\nSo, it is time to protect our planet and our fellow occupants.
