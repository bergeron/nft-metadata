    "name": "Paper Cut ",
    "description": "\"Paper Cut\" is a more colorful representation of my habit of folding all sorts of paper when I am in deep thought about things that worry me. I am quite the overthinker, and struggle to get my words out. Table napkins at diners/cafes, receipts laying around, notebooks...they're all victims to my anxiety. Triangles are my favorite thing to fold apparently. \n\nHonestly this piece came out much brighter than I had planned... I must have a habit of using bright colors to cover the deeper meaning behind my pieces. \nI wanted the stickers on her hand to cover paper cuts. They symbolize false happiness that covers the pain deep down. I hope you enjoy this piece :)\n\nCollector will receive a derivative commission ticket. \nAll bidders will receive a thank you stamp. <3 \nThank you everyone. \n\nDimensions: 3000 x 4000 px\n300 DPI ",
