    "description": "Fear is one of the first and basic emotions experienced by a person in life.\n\nFear accompanies a person throughout the life path and protects him in case of danger. But often our fears are far-fetched, they begin to prevent us from living normally and moving forward. And if you donâ€™t start fighting your invented fears in time, they will envelop a person, limiting his life, and turn into phobias.\n\nWe are all afraid, and that's normal, we just shouldn't let our fears overwhelm us.\n\nOf course we should not run headlong into impending danger, because if everyone did so, we would no longer exist as a species. We need to pull ourselves together, assess the situation, and approach it rationally.",
