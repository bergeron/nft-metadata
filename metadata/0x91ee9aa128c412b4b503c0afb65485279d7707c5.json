    "description": "It starts with a want, a fervent wish, as do most things manifested into this life. As the prayer deepens, the dream flourishes, and soon hope is born to The Phantom. A hope he never thought he’d have, one that he wouldn’t have even had the opportunity to mourn had he never grasped it. \n\nArt Specs:\n3000x3000px // Edition 1/1 // PNG\n\nBonus content: \n1. Upon winning the auction, you as the primary owner can reach out to me and I'll provide a physical framed print of your newly acquired artwork - (once shipping to your location is available.) \n\nPrint Specs: -\nEnhanced Matte Paper\nAyous Wooden Frame\n10x10in in Size\n\n2. Also winning the auction - being a holder - qualifies you for entry into a raffle where there's a chance to win a hardcover printed artbook showcasing all NFTs from the collection - compiled sequentially into story format. Think of it like a graphic novel of sorts. This happens when the collection has met its end and the story being told concludes.\n",
