    "description": "It was a cold rainy winter night in Taipei and I had just finished a short hike in the rain.  On my way back to the MRT station I encountered this scene and simply bent down and took the shot.\n\nI didn't think too much about the shot and almost deleted it.  But after tinkering around in Photoshop a bit I realized that I could bring out some nice colors with this photo.   \n\nA few edits later this became my most popular photo of all time and inspired me to continue capturing Cyberpunk scenes around Taipei.",
