Every $1 dollar donated will help remove 1 pound of plastic! ***\n\n*** A physical copy will be sent to the highest bidder as part of the sale printed on a 15.6\" HD Meural Smart WiFi Digital Photo Frame. ***\n\n\"Attraction\" is a generative art collection with the idea of adding “attractors” in a particle system to simulate certain kinds of \"fuzzy\" phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with conventional rendering techniques.\n\nI ended up creating a lot of attraction patterns by looking at the trails of various objects as they move and get attracted to different attractions.\n\nThis is the final result!",
