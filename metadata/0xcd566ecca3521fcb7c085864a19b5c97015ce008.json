    "description": "From tuna skin and blood to sour cherries jelly and anised ash dried plums.\n\nFor a photographer, falling in love with Sicily is inevitable. \nTo approach the concept of \"South\" in my personal way, the design of my project does not take inspiration directly from Sicilian food, but goes back to sources: colours, materials and their contrasts.\nDishes are made with raw materials that are not Sicilian or, even, typical of the Mediterranean cuisine.\nIn this way I intend to stress the concept of \"South\" itself and to unhinge it from the geographic territory in which it was born to enhance it as a visual and cultural archetype. \nThe mise en plat follows the same metalanguage of the whole project. First of all, each ingredient was first photographed separately. Later on, in post-production, they were all arranged following the geometric patterns of selected elements that belong to Sicilian iconography: city maps, monuments, public locations, landscapes.",
