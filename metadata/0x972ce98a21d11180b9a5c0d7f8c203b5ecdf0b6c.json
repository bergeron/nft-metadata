    "description": "\"The fires never dim and the smog never clears.\"\n\n\n\nGebon is a dry and arid planet in the 2nd orbit of its star, located in the Sothis system, within the Uzehk sector. The term Ammunite is used to describe people and products from the planet, which is one of the oldest civilizations in the universe. At one time, Gebon was green, lush, and maintained an ecological balance; but as the Ammunites grew, so did their ambitions and they weren't concerned with the cost. Almost 80% of the population reside in subterranean levels under the planetâ€™s hot and inhospitable surface, the result of hyper-industrialization and the related climatological changes that impacted the whole of the planet. The most powerful on Gebon, the Visiers, live on the many pyramids and flat-bottomed barges that hover over the planet's surface. The Ammunite economy is driven by mineral mining and trading rare goods from across the galaxy. - Tanglepedia, ref 348.1b",
