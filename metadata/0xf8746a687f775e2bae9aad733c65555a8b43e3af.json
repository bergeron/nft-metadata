    "description": "Mosaics are great representations of Hispano/Arab/Latino decorative art. In this work I tried to make this influence pop up, using pixel art as a form of expression, more than as a limitation.\n\nThe process is AI-prompting + Pixel art hand-drawn edition on my Ipad + AI Upscaling. \n\nColorful tension is achieved, in my opinion, because it manifests how the opposition of luminescence highlights formal depictions.",
