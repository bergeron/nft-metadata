    "description": "Growing up as a little boy I watched my Father studying a lot of books and having so much books in his Library; He would usually say to me he had read all the books in his shelf. Most times when we argue about things about life and political issues he would usually say \"I HAVE READ FAR AND WIDE\" meaning he has read extensively. \n\nI just wanted to use this title to illustrate how Art has made me see life in a whole wide range differently from what I would usually see it as and not just drawing still life and figure drawings on a paper or canvas in a room but Art has given me ideas from all over the world far and wide, in technology and other areas of life that I never thought possible. Art is the highest form of human expression and the society that creates it.",
