    "description": "Elton Ilirjani is a human rights and LGBT rights activist. CEO of The HeadHunter Group.\n\nFor years, the LGBTQ+ community has fought for their rights for equality and visibility in the civic space. Struggling globally to be treated as equals, yet still stay unique. To be accepted not in spite of their differences but because of it. And while the struggle continues and there is still work to be done, progress has been achieved.\nPride Icons is more than 'just another NFT project'. It pays tribute to those legendary LGBTQ+ icons that got us this far. Those who have shaped and inspired generations. It is a purpose-led community that allows its members to empower non-profit organizations while getting great benefits in return. A membership of a lifetime.",
