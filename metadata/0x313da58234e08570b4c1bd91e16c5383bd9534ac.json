    "description": "I had just moved to LA back in nov 2018 and in early 2019 I started seeing a therapist for the first time. a lot of the early work we did was spent dismantling the imposter syndrome I was feeling back then, and this demo became my mantra for that moment. writing it was like a grounding exercise that allowed me to settle into my reality and consider myself worthy of pursuing music full time. the lyrics still mean so much to me, and I'm sure one day here soon i'll find the right producer to really elevate it to a higher plane with. but for now I'm feeling called to share this version of it <3",
