    "description": "This collection was created to honor Kabosu, better known as “Doge\".\n\nWhen her puppy mill shut down in 2008, she was adopted by a Japanese kindergarten teacher and named after a citrus fruit.\n\nKabosu continues to influence culture even now, and has been referenced in popular video games as well as song lyrics. She's even inspired her own cryptocurrency — the first to be based on a meme.\n\nBold lines, vibrant colors, and a galaxy texture were used to convey to Kabosu’s impact, and to celebrate her legacy as one of the best memes of the last decade.",
