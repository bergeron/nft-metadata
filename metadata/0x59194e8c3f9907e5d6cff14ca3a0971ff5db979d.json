    "description": "Coming into contact with the energy of love did not dissolve the chaos; had it done so, the world would have changed a long time ago. The idea of one person setting the universe right has an air of hubris and belligerence. Instead, one loves this world so much they surrender themself to gravity and chance. Charting with the precision of a seismograph needle the condition of a firm, bleeding landscape. This is how we bloom.",
