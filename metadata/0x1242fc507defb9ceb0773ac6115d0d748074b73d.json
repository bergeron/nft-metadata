    "description": "Zirdalia is a bit on the reserved side and prefers to observe before joining in a conversation. She doesn’t talk much until she gets to know people, but when she does open up, she is incredibly insightful. She is a bit more than she lets on.  She has a strong sense of duty to her people, and she feels that it’s her duty to serve as a leader for them.",
