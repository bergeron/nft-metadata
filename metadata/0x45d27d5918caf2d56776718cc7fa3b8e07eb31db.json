    "description": "Backstory: \nThis labyrinth was one of my favourite spots in the entire volcanic area. There were these reeeally loud frogs living there; they'd create a cacophony at sunset, echoing up the hillsides, over the backs of any roaming coyotes, and sweeping straight through my aura. I left a beloved belonging at the labyrinth's centre before moving home. It was a way to communicate my gratitude, and quietly pay forward blessing. I wonder if it's still there? \n\nUtility: \nThe first collector of this piece is entitled to a 60min 1:1 Coaching session with me, Clear Mortifee (Life Coach, Rhodes Wellness College Ltd., 2016). If they so desire, the collector may choose to give up their 1:1 session to a creative person in their life whom they feel would benefit from my personal support. Through direct yet gentle inquiry, and the tender holding of space, my intention is to bring courage, compassion, and clarity to the receiver of this session, just as these hills have brought to me.",
