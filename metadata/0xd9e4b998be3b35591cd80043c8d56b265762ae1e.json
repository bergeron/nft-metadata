    "description": "Iranians commemorate during the Islamic month of Muharram the massacre by Umayyads at the Battle of Karbala of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad and one of the major 12 imams of Shiism. Ashura -10 Muharram- symbolizes the fight against oppression and injustice by reference to this historical event. The faithful demonstrate their sorrow and mourning through prayers, colorful processions with alams, self-flagellation rituals and reenactment of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain in historic costumes.",
