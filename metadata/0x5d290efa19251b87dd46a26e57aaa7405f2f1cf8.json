    "description": "The watercolour depicts a peaceful park on a sunny day. Lush green trees stretch their branches towards the sky, providing shade to the vibrant bushes. The tranquil atmosphere is intensified by the soft breeze that gently rustles the leaves. In the centre of the painting, a figure can be seen walking along a path, lost in thought. The figure is the imaginary self of the viewer, wandering around the park, enjoying the quietness and beauty of the surroundings. The viewer's imaginary self seems to be at peace, moving forward with a sense of purpose but also taking time to appreciate the beauty around them. The sun shines down, casting a warm glow over the scene, and the viewer's imaginary self seems to be basking in its radiance.",
