    "description": "Parkour was originally defined as the “physical discipline of training to overcome any obstacle within one's path by adapting one's movements to the environment.” It is movement in its most efficient and awe-inspiring form. \n\nWhen photographing any form of motion, it’s a challenge to convey authentic movement in a photograph—as it’s a 2D medium. My goal with the series “Parkour Motion” is to capture the energy and power of these athletes. ",
