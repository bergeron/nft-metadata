    "description": "The death of ancient gods that once roamed the galaxy ignited a mass migration of scrappers, explorers, and military powers all looking to harness the dormant power of the godcores. \n\nTechniques for harvesting such cores have advanced a great deal in the hundreds of years since the last ancient god's demise. Even so, it is rare to extract a godcore without considerable damage. For some, less advanced, civilizations, far cruder procedures have been developed. The removal of the core's essence through the retina has been the preferred method of ill-equipped scrappers and lone adventurers looking to cash in quickly. \n\n",
