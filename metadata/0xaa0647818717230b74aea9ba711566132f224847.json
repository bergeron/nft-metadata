    "description": "Hi guys :) I’m sophia alexa, I’m an artist and songwriter born in california and raised in amsterdam, now living in london. i’ve had a love of songwriting since the day my obsession with Joni Mitchell started. growing up all I listened to was 70s music while writing songs at my kitchen table and I never thought I’d be releasing them. i wrote ‘Hit and Run’ after i noticed myself feeling the need to escape every time i got too close to someone. I was afraid of feeling trapped or attached even if the relationship was positive. The escape felt like a defence mechanism and writing this song was a way to summarise that feeling. In the process of writing it i wasn’t sure if the title was too dark so contrasting it with more uptempo drums was a great way to hide the reality of the lyrics”.",
