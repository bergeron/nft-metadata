    "description": "I frequently go here for sunset. While I was taking photos, I had a conversation with this lady who was fishing. She was with her mother, who was on the other side of the dock. She hadn't caught anything yet, but was patiently waiting. It's a reminder to persevere with peace. We are all waiting for something. ",
