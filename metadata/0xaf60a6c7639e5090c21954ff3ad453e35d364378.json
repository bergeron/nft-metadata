    "description": "It is a heavy artwork for me that represents all my pain and suffering in the heart. \nI was inspired by Ukrainian Defender Serhiy Sova, who was tortured and killed in the Kharkiv district while it was occupied.\nHis primary sin was that he loved his country.\nThe image of his hand with a blue-yellow bracelet became a symbol for Ukrainians and me.\nPresident gave the reward of the Heroes of Ukraine posthumously. It was taken by his older child.\nGlory to Ukraine.\nGlory to Heroes.",
