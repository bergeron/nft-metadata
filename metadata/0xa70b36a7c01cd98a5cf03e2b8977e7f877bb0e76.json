    "description": "We all have that ever-burning flame in our souls, and like all things in life, it dims and grows, ebbs and flows. It is a direct reflection of our outlook towards the world.\n\nWhen it shrinks, we lose our passion and our direction, unsure about where to turn for inspiration and second-guessing even mundane decisions. I am a firm believer in change as a way to add kindling to this flame, since change encourages us to live new experiences, meet new people, and solve new problems.\n\nEarly in 2022, I bought a one-way ticket to Mexico... I was famished for change and wanted to pour gasoline all over my internal flame. \n\nThroughout this solo two-month trip, I reconnected with nature, met others from all walks of life, and found artistic inspiration in places I didn't think it existed. \n\nOut of those ashes grew this artwork 'Come to the Light' that to this day I hold dear to me. \n\nIt serves as a reminder to seek that light, that change, to help illuminate your path forward.\n\n- Chris",
