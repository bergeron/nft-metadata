    "description": "The symbiosis of copper and ferric chloride form organic landscapes that change every day. The battle that takes place produces a wonderful jumble of sensory impressions. Copper defending itself with corrosion, ferric chloride that evaporates, and the grotesque coexistence between the two. With an almost scientific character, theese landscapes becomes as a collab where the amount of copper and ferric, the strength of the ferric chloride solution and my patience determine the outcome of the images. This series of exclusive NFTs is a photographic documentation of moments of impermanence from the irl studio of a traditional printmaker. \n",
