    "description": "Bomb Story: For our in-line collection, Adam Bomb has relatively kept the status quo with the trademark black/red/white/yellow colorway. But, there are rare circumstances where we manipulated his color components for a seasonal collection. The Color Adams are examples of how we introduced our audience to shades of Adam they'd never seen before.| Background Story: \r\nPerfect camo is our homage to the generic, swap meet, woodland camo that decorated ravers in the '90s and the trend's resurgence on cargo pants in the late 2010s. Bobby's favorite appearance by the classic orange woodland was under Bill Murray's blazer in Lost in Translation. ",
