    "description": "Winter in Massachusetts is long and cold.  It also provides a special beauty.  Winter reminds me of both the joy and despair of life.  Childhood memories of snow days, hot chocolate, and sledding. The march of time. Death and rebirth. I find myself going out for walks after storms. Before everyone else has decided to leave the comfort of their warm homes. The softened sounds leave me alone with my contemplations. Snow hides the imperfections. The whole world covered in a pristine blanket.  Light paints the snow and reflects off the wet asphalt. I take a photograph to hold the moment in time. \n\nLike everything else it is temporary. The imperfections slowly return. Soon the snow will recede and spring will return. \n\n1/1 NFT by Bryan P Jackson",
