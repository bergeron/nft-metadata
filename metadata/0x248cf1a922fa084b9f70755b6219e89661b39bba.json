    "description": "Taken back in November of 1998. This is one  of my first official attempts in Photography. \nWhy the title? \nWell the stop sign almost overlaps the tree trunk. I thought my angle of view was good and I that I could get it right, but I  missed that lower part of the trunk. \nThe idea was to make the octagon look like there were branches all over. I could  have photoshopped it but no, that's the beauty and \"ugliness\" of film photography. \nImage scanned with a Plustek Opticfilm 8200i Scanner.\n\n---\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holders are free to use in advertising or parts of merchandise, including but not limited to, t-shirts, tote bags, mugs, advertising, promotion, brochures, packaging or as part of a commercial website for promotional purposes.
