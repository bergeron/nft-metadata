    "description": "In 2077, the Interdimensional Exploration Program (IEP) unlocked the unknown by creating a stable portal to a new reality, using the Matter-Energy Extraction Device (MEED). \n\nOn June 12th, the MEED successfully extracted a mineral deposit, creating two stable portals. The IEP then sent probes through the portals, revealing a dimension with matter in pure energy form. On December 21th, the IEP-1 Portal was officially opened for humanity to explore and study, marking a significant milestone in humanity's journey beyond reality.\n\nMade in Blender & Photoshop.",
