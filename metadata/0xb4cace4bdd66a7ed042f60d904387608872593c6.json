    "description": "This artist is fascinated by the appearance of tribal witch doctors, their position within their society, and their mysterious ways. \n\nThroughout history, ruling powers have sought control by the threat of death, the most horrendous practice being burnt at the stake. \n\nBy creating AI artworks that feature these enigmatic figures, the artist's goal is to comment on society's compulsion to destroy fringe ideas and crush what it does not understand.\n\nThe artist believes that this compulsion is what led to the mass witch hunts of the past and that it's still present today in the way society treats different belief systems and movements at the fringes.\n\nThe artist hopes that their art will start a dialogue and be a call to action for their audience to be open-minded and tolerant of others who are not in their particular tribe.  \n",
