    "description": "Nothing is over, nor will it ever end.\nLife is a road after all, and man is a time traveler. Dreaming from the past to the future in front of the free flight of seagulls on a ferry is also a part of this time. When one remembers another moment in every square of the city lying across, one wants to shake off the dust of time. Opening every memory like a matryoshka. But we are all like Sisyphus. We are the product of the role assigned to us in the face of time.",
