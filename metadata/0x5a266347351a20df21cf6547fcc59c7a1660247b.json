    "description": "The MinxieVerse Pass NFTs are a collection of 10,000 unique utility- and access-based PFP assets representing the Mascot of the Minxie Ecosystem - Leader of the Anti-Shadowban, Shadowbanned Club. The Minxie Ecosystem will include both a blockchain-based Content Platform and an NFT Marketplace that address issues experienced by artists and creators who are currently stuck on web2 platforms.  Minxie especially solves for those in marginalized and underserved categories such as cannabis, adult, and crypto, who are often spending their time recovering deactivated accounts and combating major disruptions in their visibility via algorithms and shadowbanning. Holders of the MinxieVerse Pass NFTs will get first access to the Platform after its official release in Q1 of 2023, as well as a number of additional perks including an airdrop of the platform's transactional tokens, IRL access to events and venues hosted and operated by Minxie and its Partners, and a voice in determining which of the Platform's Creators should be featured on our NFT Marketplace upon its launch.",
