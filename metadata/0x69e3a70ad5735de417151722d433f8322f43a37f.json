    "description": "I wrote this in June. During that time I was getting over someone, writing a bunch of songs about them as a way of venting. And after many short lived voice memos and poorly played guitar songs, I created this one. This is probably the final song I’d written and recorded about them, and a great ending to that chapter. \n\nI love this song with all my heart. I’m in love with the story that progresses as you listen. It starts off painting the picture of seeing someone again for the first time in a while. That feeling where your heart isn’t fully healed from whatever had happened previously between you both. The chorus talks about a part of that person that you can never fully get over. “Those beautiful eyes will never let me go”. \n\nTrue. \n\nI love the back and forth between me describing my feelings and contradicting them with the idea of it being pointless to write songs about this person, because they don’t care. And as you continue to listen, the story evolves. The second verse reminisces on old memories. Staying up till 6am. It compares these memories to how things are in the present: “Now we act like none of it ever happened”. I mention the fact that they won’t get the satisfaction of seeing me hurt, because I’d already given them so much before. \n\nAnd the last minute reflects on what could’ve been and what actually happened. It ends off by mentioning the whole point of this person toying with my emotions while I’d been in the process of writing about them. Hence the title, \n\n“While I Write About You”. \n",
