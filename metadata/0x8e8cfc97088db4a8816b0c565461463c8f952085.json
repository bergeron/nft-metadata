    "description": "Hair ia an important part of our being. And how we choose to wear our hair should not be a path way to various forms of embarrasment or humiliation or profiling.\nThis is about dada. Dada is the Nigerian name for locs. Young people in Nigeria are constantly harrassed and bullied and profiled due to the kind of hair they wear, especially when wearing dada. And this absurdity is done by some police officers who are supposed to protect the rights of the people. \nIt is as though there is something dreadful about locs, probably the reason why some people on locs do not like it being called dreadlocs. \nAnd yes, there is nothing dreadful about the way you wear your hair. Hair style is a form of expression. It is also a form of fashion. Hair does not define responsibility or morality or criminality. Hair is just hair, this kinky crown placed on our heads that often gives us sense of ownership and care and confidence.\n\nWe need to do better and stop judging people based on their hair style.",
