As we were driving through the open grass field, we ran into a colony of maybe a hundred elephants crossing the road. We parked afar and waited for them to pass by. However, unexpectedly the elephants waited to let us pass by like pedestrians at an intersection. As we slowly drove through their colony right in the middle, I looked to my right at this elderly elephant right in the eyes through my lens and captured him patiently waiting for us to pass by with a friendly a gaze.",
