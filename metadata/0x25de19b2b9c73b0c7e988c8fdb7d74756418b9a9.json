    "description": "This is the story of a man who found fame in an ordinary suburb in Adelaide. He lay on the beach on an unusually balmy evening. He waved at passers-by. \n\nAnd as the sun set on the last day of spring, this man's secrets would become mysteries. \n\nMysteries that would bring the passions of medieval Persia and the anxieties of the Cold War to suburban Australia. A series of riddles hinting at forbidden love and murder.\n\nSecrets that have disturbed the world ever since the dawn of summer 1948, when this well-dressed man was discovered dead on the beach at Somerton Park\n\nNo injuries, no identification, and every label removed from his clothing. There was no one missing who fit his description. A dead man with no name. He simply became 'Somerton Man.'\n\n\nBased on a true storyâ€¦ as true as it can be.\nWritten by Lion Young & Tim Fry\nMusic by Josh Moult, Tim Fry & Lion Young",
