    "description": "Imagine a transparent world. Everything would be clear and visible, wouldn't it? People's thoughts, feelings and intentions could be read by everyone. There would be no secrets and taboos between people. It might seem scary at first, but over time, with a different perspective, we would see that people around the world would communicate more honestly and openly with each other, that conflicts between people would be resolved faster. because no one would feel the need to hide their true thoughts. we would be able to build the much-needed sense of trust on solid foundations. who knows, maybe one day a transparent world might even help us come of age as human beings.\n\n-Opinion Created by Acidqueen-",
