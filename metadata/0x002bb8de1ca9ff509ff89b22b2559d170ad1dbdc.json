    "description": "VIRAL ENERGY (Video Poster) forms part of an allowlist quest for Wisdoms for Neknel, an extensive Web3 native project by artist collective Keiken. \n\nVIRAL ENERGY is an interactive film set in a speculative future inside the metaverse. It explores our dependency and animistic nature towards our screens and how self-centered technologies evoke connection yet produce loneliness. It is the first episode in The Life Game series, exploring the whirlwind relationship between ME and their digital twin MI. Are they meant to be together? Are they really the same or do they have different intentions?\n\nExplore: https://twitter.com/neknelworld + https://neknel.world",
