    "name": "Schrödinger’s Cat",
    "description": "Schrödinger's experiment illustrates the absurdity of the universe on the quantum level. It states that if you place a cat and something that could kill the cat (a radioactive atom) in a box and seal it, you would not know if the cat was dead or alive until you opened the box, so until the box was opened, the cat was- in a sense, both ‘dead and alive’. The cat represents the young artist who has never left the shores of his country, seeking to think beyond the possibility of him being successful professionally or not, beyond his socioeconomic landscape. So it’s really still a thought, not a canvas.\n\n16 x 20 inch || Acrylic on Canvas\n2019\n\n* Collector gets the physical piece delivered anywhere in the world *",
