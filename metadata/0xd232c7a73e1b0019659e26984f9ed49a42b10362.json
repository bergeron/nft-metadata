    "description": "treinta lunas (thirty moons) is here for us to look at and examine the moon's deep-seated meaning and significance, for us as humans and throughout various belief systems, including its representation of femininity, fertility, and change amongst other concepts. An attempt to explore the celestial body's rich history and symbolism throughout various cultures around the world. The collection delves into the moon's cyclical nature and how it has influenced human behavior and cultural practices throughout time. This work is very personal, it’s some sort of introspection, a dream, studying and trying to understand the moon as I represent it since it became one of my Signature elements.",
