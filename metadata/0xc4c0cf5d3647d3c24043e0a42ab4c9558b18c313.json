    "description": "Gone Fishing: Feb 26, 2016\n\nMiami: Another Day in Paradise‚Äù is a collection of 25 images taken over the course of 6+ years, using 3 cameras, and chosen from thousands of photos. I moved to Miami not knowing much about the city. As a way to get to know the 305, I decided to take the streets with my camera to explore and observe. \n\nThis collection of street photography is my homage to the time I spent in Miami and Miami Beach.",
