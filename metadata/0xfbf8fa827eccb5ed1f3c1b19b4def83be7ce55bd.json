    "description": "In this piece I wanted to convey the feeling of being in a world without borders.\n\nThis painting took me about six months to complete with many layers, due to its intricacy and detail particularly inspired by Persian storytelling and the traditional patterns found in carpets and tiles. The word “Today” is incorporated into the painting and became its title. Today in my adopted homeland in the West, I create my own stories, colorscapes, shapes, and textures. \n\n Exhibited this piece in multiple international exhibitions and galleries in Sweden and also displayed Today at Museum of Dos Terceiros, Portugal.\n\nMaterial: Mixed Media\n\nOne of a kind Artwork by Mani Saemi\n\nSize:47.2 W x 59.1 H inches",
