    "description": "Regenesis is a collection of art NFTs celebrating the Ethereum Merge, a historic technological milestone and testament to the capability of decentralized software development. This live and seamless network upgrade to Proof of Stake, reduces Ethereumâ€™s carbon footprint by 99.95%, increases security and lays the foundation to unlock massive scalability and opportunity in the future.\n\nTo share this moment with the community, ConsenSys commissioned a series of illustrations, each depicting an elaborately detailed fictional world embodying one of the prime benefits of the Merge: sustainability, security, and scalability.\n\nThis NFT was [minted](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcf92f67b37495b4149a522da5dce665cddd1c183c79ba1e870564f77ffaabbca) in the [First Block of Ethereum PoS](https://etherscan.io/block/15537394)",
