    "description": "LNRZ ON SOUND WK 1 \n\nVaarwell is an electronic duo with a captivating signature sound. We were immediately drawn to the specificity of their writing and the tasteful beauty of the production. \n\nIn their own words:\n\n“IDK” is a UK Garage inspired track about the mystery of life, death and its aftermath. It questions a superior creator and the afterlife beliefs we were taught as kids. The song finds no answer to these questions, with the chorus being an admission of ignorance and eagerness to find out the truth.\n\n \"I don't know what to believe. Am I really here? How?\"",
