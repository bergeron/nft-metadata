    "description": "Inspiration:\n\nOrganics is a collection of images inspired by dried flowers, the natural world and the original generated art form, nature itself. Perhaps a little influenced by displays at the British Museum.\n\nCollection Details\n\nWithin the collection there will be 10 sets of 8 'editions'. Each piece will be a  unique 1/1, however there will be 8 which have a similiar look, making a themed 'edition' within the collection. \n\nFloor price will be respected, and increased over time.\n\nProduction:\n\nCreated by composite photoshop digital arts, AI Generative components, real world textures and digitised traditional media. \n\nThe images are circa 2304px x 3840px. Help and guidance on physical printing available.\n\nNote: Some of the images have quotes from friends and communities that I belong to. An alternate version without the quote is available on request\n\nCreator:\n\nZal4dw (@paulbratcher), A published and exhibited artist, creator and photographer based in the UK. ",
