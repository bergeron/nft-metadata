    "description": "Well, today is my birthday! ü•∞\n\nAnd this means that I have become smarter and wiser than last year. I learned a lot of new things for myself, visited different places, met cool people who brought something new and interesting into my life. And I also realized that money is just a resource that we need to use competently. To live not for money, but to live for yourself. Travel, study different cultures, meet new people. After all, these things will give us the opportunity to expand our knowledge, experience wonderful emotions and develop both spiritually and physically.\n\nI wrote this song based on my feelings. Money is good, but it will not replace your emotions, your travels, your feelings of love. The most valuable thing in our life is time, and I choose to spend it with pleasure, learning new things, traveling. And I want you to enjoy this life like me, feel my vibe through this track.\n\nLove you all ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n( I'll save all the money from the sale of the track for traveling this summer ü•∞ )",
