    "description": "Once I had to live with the nomads for a month for a photography project, they had a little girl named Fatima.\nFatima always worked with her mother, she had beautiful eyes, Fatemeh lived in the mountains since she was a child and was always moving with her family. One morning when I woke up, I saw Fatima, I quickly took the camera and took picture from her.\n I took a photo, the first bright light on Fatima's hair, I like this portrait very much and that is why I named this photo my Mona Lisa. She talks to me with her eyes.\nToday, about ten years have passed since this photo and I do not know where Fatima is and what she is doing, but I hope to see her again one day and take a photo of her.\n",
