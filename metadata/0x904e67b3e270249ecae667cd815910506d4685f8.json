    "description": "He was once a young student in the seminary. But God left people to their painful life. People were suffering from famine and heavy taxes, but neither confession to God nor protesting could help. It dawned on him that the real root of the problem lay in power. The Pope and the King were on the same side of evil control. By chance, he saw the Whitepaper circulated secretly among people. Feeling shocked, he realized that the proposals in it are the true answer to stop all suffering."
