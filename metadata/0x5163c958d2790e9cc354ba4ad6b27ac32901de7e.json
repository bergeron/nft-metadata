    "description": "\nHeavily inspired by Max from Stranger Things.\nCool, strong and courageous woman. \n\nIt takes a lot of work and great fashion sense to be this “effortlessly cool”. These Gen Z girls dress casually but know exactly what they are putting on. They shop at Urban Outfitters, they love vintage 90’s style type of clothes. Skateboarding, cycling and graffiti are part of their daily routine.\n",
