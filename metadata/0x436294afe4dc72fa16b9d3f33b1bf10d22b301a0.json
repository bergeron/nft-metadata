    "description": "In a world of fast fashion and TikTok trends, true individuality has become a rarity. What does it mean to stand out? What is considered original? \n\nUsing makeup as an extension of pattern and design, it can transform clothing by bringing it past the hem line  onto to the skin, face and hair.\n\nMy body is a canvas and every inch functions to personify my artistic vision. I am my fashion and my fashion is alive.\n\nDigital Photography by Mthr Trsa\nModel, makeup and clothing by Laurel Charleston",
