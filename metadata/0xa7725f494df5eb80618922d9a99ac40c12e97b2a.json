    "description": "As Soul Surfer Bethany Hamilton said, “Life is a lot like surfing, when you get caught in the impact zone, you’ve got to just get back up. Because you never know what may be over the next wave.”\n\nAfter spending a few weeks on Siargao Island, around October 2021, I began working on this art piece. When Super Typhoon Odette struck the island in December while I was there, this piece went on a journey of its own and turned out to be even more profoundly meaningful. Numerous things were damaged, and some people lost their lives. But dreams and hope can never perish when your breath is spared.\n\nIn addition to being the Surf Capital of the Philippines, Siargao is one of the best islands in Asia because it is home to genuine Filipino hospitality, an abundance of energetic minds, delicious food, and unique natural escapes.",
