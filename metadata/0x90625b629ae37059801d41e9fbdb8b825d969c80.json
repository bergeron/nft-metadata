Follow it.\n\nA remade moment from the movie \"The Matrix\" directed by Lana & Lilly Wachowski.\nThe Spoon boy and Neo scene.\nThe original soundtrack was remixed especially for this NFT token.\n\n\"Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth. There is no spoon. Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.\"",
