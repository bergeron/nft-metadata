    "description": "Gotham is a 10/10 edition offering of an image captured in Brooklyn off the train platform at Marcy Ave station. \n\nThis photo was taken during my earliest explorations of the urban jungle that is New York. I always aim to capture something unique, even at popular spots, and in this case I wanted to present the duality of NYCs traffic and also use inspiration from a number of noir-like films to produce a piece that encapsulated the heavy energy of this city at night.\n\n10/10 edition token by Austin J Schofield, austinvisual",
