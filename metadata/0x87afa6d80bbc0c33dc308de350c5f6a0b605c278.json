    "name": "The Pianist's Page ",
    "description": "During her hours at the mansion, the maid with black hair and hidden white strands occasionally took a stroll into the unattended garden where she learned how to play the piano. She would only \nvisit the abandoned location once a day during her longest break time. But each day, she was able to learn and memorize the sound of each key. Eventually playing the piano as comfortably as the pianist who is hired for every party that the wealthy family throws. \nEach day that passed, the maid with unique hair color daydreamed of leaving the mansion to become something greater. Something greater than what she was shown and learnt growing up. \nShe wanted to take her newly found skill and share it with the world. Maybe not in a maid's outfit, but a dazzling and glamorous ball gown. A dress that reflects her true value and potential in the world. \nThis is the page dedicated to those who have yet to discover their true self worth, and potential in their lifetime. Itâ€™s never too late. ",
