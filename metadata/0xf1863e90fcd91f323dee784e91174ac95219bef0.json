    "description": "Directed and composed by François Chevalier, \"Recherche & Développement\" is an introspective journey into a universe steeped in mysticism and technology, with an aesthetic, experimental, metaphysical, and emotional reflection.\n\nIn this strange dance where human and machine intertwine, the erudite artist observes with fascination the fusion of worlds that unfolds before his eyes. Like a modern alchemist, he uses technology as a magical tool to bring ideas, concepts, and emotions to life, attempting to offer a new vision, imbued with beauty, dream, and emotion.\n\nHe also reveals the fears and concerns that plague our society in a constantly changing world where technology continues to redefine the contours of our existence.\n\nThese questions, doubts, and reflections are like flowers blooming in the artist's mind. While algorithms calculate and computers work, he explores the depths of the human soul, seeking to reveal the mysteries hidden beneath the circuits and data.",
