    "name": "PUBLIC SEX",
    "description": "In this day and age, things like cybersex and the pandemic have decreased queer activities like cruising and public sex. Spaces to connect with others were once limited and the acceptance of sexuality was not embraced by the public eye. Queers have been fornicating in places like public bathrooms since the beginning of time because of lack of acceptance and space. These public places have become legendary in queer culture because of their historic discrete locations that hosted horny queers for decades. Now websites and mobile apps connect likeminded people from all over the world and can bring them together face to face. Public sex is now labeled a \"fetish\" since private spaces to host sexual activities are more tangible and accessible. Public Sex is a homage to cruising culture. ",
