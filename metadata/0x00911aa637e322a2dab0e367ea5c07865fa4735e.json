    "description": "NIÄKAK is an original generative work by Iskra Velitchkova created on the occasion of the fourth edition of Cure3, to raise awareness and funds for Cure Parkinson's. 100% of the proceeds will go to the cause.\n\n“NIÄKAK” (somehow in Bulgarian) is a story about an everyday trip by train that my father would make after school, fostering this way his own pretext to engrave a collection of memories with his grandfather – which still define him. And also myself through him.\n\n–\nDetails:\nNFT: PNG 3000x3000px\nExhibited: on January 13-17 2023 as a print 20x20cm\nYear:   2022\n",
