    "description": "Hi there. My name is Artem. I was born and raised in Donetsk region, Ukraine.\nBack in 2014, Russia launched an assassination attempt on my region. This has simply escalated into a passive conflict that has been taking the lives of Ukrainian citizens for 8 years.\nNow is 2022, I live in Kyiv and they are trying to take away my homeland again. All completely. From territory to language and culture.\nOur Ukrainian Army, side by side with civilians, is courageously defending our land from the Russian occupiers and accelerating the plot I have portrayed in this work. This will undoubtedly happen in the near future, but the Ukrainian Army needs constant support, including financial support.\n100% of the money from the sale of this art will be sent to the \"Return Alive\" fund, which supports the army.\nI understand that for many people this amount may be too much, but you can also help a lot by spreading this art.\n\nUkraine will be free and happy! Glory to Ukraine!üá∫üá¶",
