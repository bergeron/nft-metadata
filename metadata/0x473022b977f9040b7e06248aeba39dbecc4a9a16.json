Each work has its own source - selfie photos in high resolution. All works are unique and different\nThe reserve of the entire Headband collection is about 5000 unique author's NFTs. Ready to accept offers from collectors for the price of my works, and other issues. I am always open to all my friends, ready to make profitable offers, gifts, and bonus NFTs. + The main bonus is the next second collection (I will provide information about it to everyone)\nDM‚úâÔ∏è any questions\nMore info - in my Twitter\n",
