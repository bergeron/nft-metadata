    "description": "My camera arm got broken in an accident in city traffic in 2015. Before that I was pursuing a corporate career. But after I decided to work on my own. In the company I was safe but outside I was free. Working with a broken arm is painful but living the wrong life is more. Machines can do harm, nature can heal. So when I got a call to work by the ocean, i took it. Shortly after I was there, next to a red telephone.",
