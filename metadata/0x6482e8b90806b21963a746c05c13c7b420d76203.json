    "description": "One of my favorite images to date,\n\nAlba, La Costa Brava, August '20\n\nShot on medium format 120mm film two and a half hours away from Barcelona, Spain while road tripping the Mediterranean on what felt as an endless summer.\n\nThe photo has been exhibited in Sidney, L.A, and Hossegor, published online, printed in a couple of my favorite magazines, has won prizes and was my obvious choice to publish here as my first 1/1 nft.\n\nThe winner of the auction will also receive a full size print of La Costa Brava.\n\n",
