    "description": "The Turing Test (Imitation Game), developed in 1950 by Alan Turing, is a test that determines a computer's ability to engage in intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. In an age on the brink of Singularity, the difference between humanity and machine grows thinner. AIs now have the ability to engage in convincing conversation, master complex games, and even generate beautiful art. But where do we draw the line between the unique beauty of human creativity and the creativity of an intelligent machine? This series, I Would nt Want to be Like You asks the viewer to engage with their own perspective on Artificial Creativity. Each piece is a collaboration between a machine and its human counterpart, and begs the viewer to determine where the line is drawn. ",
