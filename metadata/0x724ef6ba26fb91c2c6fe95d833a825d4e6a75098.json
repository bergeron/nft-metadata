    "description": "This handmade art in particular is my favorite, also strange, since it is an abstract representation of my dreams throughout all the years, I titled it \"The gates to the unknow world\", since that is how I observed the doors to hell and wanted to recreate them. \n\nThis is an art made by hand with pencil and pen, I dedicated a lot of time and love to it.\n\nThis piece was made in 2017 and is part of my personal collection. \n\nThe highest bidder can take out the original sketch of this drawing.\n\nDimensions: 2566x3491\nFile size: 2.80MB",
