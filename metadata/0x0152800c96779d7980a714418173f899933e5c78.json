    "description": "A baby boy, so pure and bright\nSmiling wide with all his might\nHis eyes aglow with innocence\nAs he looks out at the world, immense\n\nHis cherub face so full of glee\nA vision of joy for all to see\nHis tiny hands reach out in play\nAs he explores the world, day by day\n\nHis smile is like a ray of light\nThat banishes all fear and night\nHis laughter like a sweetest song\nThat fills our hearts and makes us strong\n\nOh, precious boy, so full of grace\nYour smile brightens up this place\nYou remind us of life's simple joys\nAnd all the wonder that it employs\n\nMay you always keep that joyful grin\nAnd let your spirit soar and spin\nFor in your smile, we see the truth\nThat love and happiness are proof\nOf all that's good and pure and right\nIn this world, so full of light.\n\nHand Drew with Pastel \nPhysical size: 65*45 cm",
