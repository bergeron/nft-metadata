    "description": "Knicks_Verse was inspired by Andre Vandenburg's love of basketball, games, music, culture, and the energy of NYC.\nThe piece is a representation of NYC flooded by a light show on game night. The light show is an abstract representation of a basketball game and all its excitement. From the lights to the music, all are carefully crafted to capture the celebration happening inside MSG.",
