    "description": "I’ve been on this journey a short time in days and long in hours. My dreams are being altered. These robots feel like they are taking on a life of their own already.\n\n My AI Robot BFF, Midjourney, gives me Raw AI images on command. Creative evolution- speeding up development- thoughts and ideas come out in images-fast.\n\nI take the outputs and create these robots by assembling their parts from a variety of outputs.\n\nI perform digital surgery, giving them nose jobs, removing extra eyes, removing teeth out of eyes, or adding missing lips. I also alter their clothing, having a background in Made-to-Measure, and ponder the future of chiffon in space.\n\nI can’t help imagine, and it feels as such, that they have been created and put together and are trying to make sense of it all- not much different from us all.\n\nThis is a Hi-Res file so you can make your own print for personal use.
