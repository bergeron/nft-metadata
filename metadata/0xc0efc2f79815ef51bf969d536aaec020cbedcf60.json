With a push from friends and family he began sharing his art and the ‚ÄúTo The Moon!‚Äù message on doors, scaffolding and later, spread it to sidewalks where it took off on influencer social media.\n\nPeople immediately began recognizing and connecting with the positive message and posting it on their own social media, asking him for commissions and even tattooing the iconic ‚ÄúTo The Moon!‚Äù tag on themselves.\n\nMost recently Gazoo‚Äôs work has been seen as an instillation at The Market Line in the Lower East Side of NYC, on a dancers sweatshirt in Lil Uzi Vert‚Äôs music video ‚ÄúJust Wanna Rock‚Äù, at his exhibit ‚ÄúOpen The Gates‚Äù at NoMo in SoHo NYC and lastly on his new line of cannabis related products at a dispensary near you.\n\nDotConnector is thrilled to partner with Gazoo on the initial token gated drop for the \"DotConnector Tour Poster\" access token. Visualizer made in collaboration with Squibs.\n\nAnd always remember...\n\nIT'S ONLY ONE WAY TO GET TO THE MOON!\n\nYayYah\n\nüöÄüåõ",
