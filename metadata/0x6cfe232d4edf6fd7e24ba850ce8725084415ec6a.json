    "description": "\"Immotus Motor Urbis Aeternae: Romae Renascentis Fundamentum\"\n\nThe Unmovable Mover is a concept attributed to Aristotle. In it, he sees the explanation of the Cosmos. A principle so perfect that it moves while preserving its essence. It is and it is not. It moves while resting, and stays still because it iterates.\n\nDynamis / Potentia... In perpetual act and potency. \n\nParadoxical in its existence.\n\nMy intention here was to provide a visually immersive experience of its fundamentals, even though this would be only an approximation.\n\nCreated using AI, Post-Edition, and SFX. It's my inaugural 1/1 from my The New School of Ath3ns collection.\n\nA 4K resolution video can be provided to the collector if needed.",
