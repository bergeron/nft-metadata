    "description": "Elements of Earth is an ongoing collection of photos from around the world featuring earth, water, wind, and fire in order to tell the story of the power of the world in which we live. I designed this collection to be an adventure that collectors can take part in year after year. Each photo is meticulously created in the field and then curated to ensure only the best are included in the collection. Exploring the natural elements and designs of the earth brings me the most joy and gives me an outlet to express myself as a photographer. I want to dedicate this collection to my family who cheers me on and helps me live out my dreams.\n\nEARTH #1 was created in Death Valley National Park, California in January 2022.",
