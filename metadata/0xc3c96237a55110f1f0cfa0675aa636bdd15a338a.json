    "description": "The countryâ€™s largest eid congregation was held at historic Sholakia Eidgah in Kishoreganj district in Bangladesh at 10:00am on 3rd May 2022.\n\nThousands of devotees joined the congregation amid tight security measures after a two-year closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSholakia Eidgah held its 195th Eid congregation this year. A special munajat was offered seeking divine blessings for peace, development and welfare of the people of the country as well as the Muslim Ummah.\n\nIn 1828, the first Eid congregation was held at Sholakia ground. After a Covid-induced hiatus of two years, the largest Eid congregation in Asia was held at Sholakia Eidgah Maidan in Kishoreganj, Bangladesh.\n\nDevotees at Sholakia prayed for all Muslims and sought blessings from Allah. A four-tier security system was put in place to ensure the safety of the devotees.\n\nDetails ~\nArtist: Azim Khan Ronnie\nEdition: 1/1\nLocation: Bangladesh/2022\nShot on: DJI Mavic 2 Pro\nDimensions: 5464 x 3640\nCollection: Prayers",
