    "description": "In the central region of the continent of Alta lies the Wastes of Gordeus, a long forgotten region encompassing a vast area on Kaddara. The once fertile region, now a desolate wasteland host to a plethora of ancient anomalies, was once renowned for it's most prosperous Kingdom: the Kingdom of Gordon. \n\nIn those long forgotten days, It's most remembered monarch, MIDAS, led the kingdom to prosperity, whilst single-handedly ushering its demise with nothing more than his insatiable appetite for riches. So impressive was his hunger for wealth that he accumulated wealth from within and without his kingdom. During the Great Mutiny, he was given the moniker \"Golden Touch\". \n\nIt was previously thought that the monarch and his attendants perished at the hands of his citizens, as none of his attendants survived the attack and his body was never found in the smoldering debris. Several ages and one planetary catastrophe later, one Traveler happens finds out otherwise.",
