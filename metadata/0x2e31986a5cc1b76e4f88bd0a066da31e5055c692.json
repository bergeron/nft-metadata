    "description": "Official video for “Amnesia” directed by SVDP.  Creating a sleek world that fuses fashion and surrealism, “Amnesia” takes the audience on a hypnotic journey.  Taking a minimal approach in its composition, the video highlights SVDP and Ami’s performance of the infectious single produced by fellow sideways member La+ch. Shot by award winning photographer/cinematographer Gajan Balan, the video has become a notable favourite in the SVDP catalogue.\n\nShan Vincent de Paul is a Toronto based multidisciplinary artist fusing digital art, cinema, music and animation to create a vivid and surreal world where the ancient past collides with a distant future. Shan released this third studio album “Made in Jaffna” in September and was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone India, Forbes, GQ, Now Magazine, Complex, BBC, CBC, and several others. Having independently garnered over 10 millions streams for the last project, SVDP has become a notable name within the global hip-hop scene.",
