    "description": "Mixed Company series of mixed media portraits began in 2016 and various collections within this series have been exhibited throughout Japan since that time. The art is tactile in nature consisting of hand-drawn elements, found paper collage elements, and for the first time digital elements. These characters are based on a lifetime of observation and people-watching. Street fashion, youth culture, and life experiences are the subject, focusing on expression and human qualities and presented in a paired down minimal, visual vocabulary. I'm interested in the gritty, quirky, goofy, ugly, cute, strange, and imperfect aspects of people from all walks of life.",
