    "description": "What encouraged me to take this picture was the Global Water Challenge which has endangered human life in some parts of the world. A woman who, despite her resolute and powerful look, is looking anxiously over distance; a little girl whose messy hair signifies the irrationality of nature and the future, and the dancing silk cloth that precedes the cloud over their future; a cloud in the hope that it will rain and a black silk cloth which narrates the sinister tale of crisis and the misery of water shortage.\nThe shadows are inclined to the clouds, to the hope; although they lead to unproductive thorns and desert plants.\n\nEdition 1/1\nImage size - 6051 x 4841\nCreated - October 2019\n\n*If you would like a signed fine art copy printed, feel free to contact me.\nShipping is free.",
