    "description": "Kathakali is the great artform of Kerala that originated in the 16th century, the same time period as Shakespeare. The origin is attributed to the famous Sage Bharata. This work of art is a combination of Leonardo DiCaprio from his popular movie, \"The Great Gatsby,\" and this unique art form from Kerala. It blends this traditional folklore of Kerala with the pop culture meme of the movie, The Great Gatsby, raising a toast. The intent of this art is to bring you a combination of pop-culture and traditional folklore. \nThe ultimate notion of this work is to present you with a connection between the flamboyant lifestyle of the Great Gatsby that portrays various illusions and deceits with the multitude of expressions portrayed in this art form. It captivates the world of the wealthy from the Great Gatsby as opposed to Kathakali, which is the poor man's rich art. ",
