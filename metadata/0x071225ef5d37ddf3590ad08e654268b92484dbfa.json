    "description": "The construction of self-identity can be a very complex process. Every individuals identity is developed through the influence of their culture and expectations given at birth.  Through this given identity, we are expected to think, behave and act in certain ways that fit the mold of societal norms. This piece expresses how complex this process can be, when how we are expected to behave doesnâ€™t match our instincts.",
