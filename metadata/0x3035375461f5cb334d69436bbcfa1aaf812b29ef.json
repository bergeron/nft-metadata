    "description": "It all started with a retreat in a quiet beach town of southern Spain. Seeking creative nourishment, we (anatu & L.A. Rochelle) met for a week of experimenting & philosophizing with their evolving relationships with music. With no goal in mind, songs gradually formed around their vague intention of making dance music with meaning.\n\n‘Afterlife’ is a musical painting of the scene in Gladiator where he waits for his loves in the Elysian fields. Papa’s vocal & lyrics have a sweetness that grounds the jumpy amapiano-influenced log drum. Hopefully this song takes you away from your problems, for a moment, into your own vision of heaven.",
