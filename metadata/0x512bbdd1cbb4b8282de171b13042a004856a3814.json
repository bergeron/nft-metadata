    "description": "This world constantly amazes me, from minor details in a snowflake to the shapes of distant mountains. Yet, the day I visited this heart-shaped island, I was awed by our earth.\n\nIt can feel limiting to be a photographer in New England. Finding this island was striking gold, but it was 6hrs away, and making that trip with good weather conditions seemed daunting.\n\nDuring a visit with family up north, I saw sunrise had potential and took the chance. I said my goodnights, set my alarm for 2 am, and attempted to sleep. The 3hr drive in the dark was rough, I had barely slept, and the conditions were unknown. My stomach was nauseous, and my mind was full of doubt. \n\nI arrived and couldn't see anything due to the fog. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I didn't quit. I paced back and forth while waiting for the drone to start, and eureka! The fog drifted away, and the island presented itself in all its heart-shaped glory!\n\nGrateful for the music by Clemens Ruh.",
