    "description": "the relationship ballet creates between the dancer and the mirror is one of the most toxic. you canâ€™t help but look back and see if you are any better than last time, or you look as good as you feel. the mirror is both a tool for criticism and an obstacle in the way of freedom. and the only way around that obstacle is to accept and love yourself no matter what you see. \n\nthis is a self portrait taken by me on my mamiya 645 1000s. the film is portra 800. processing done by Indie Film Lab. \n\nmuch love,\nmax ",
