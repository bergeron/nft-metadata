    "description": "Dirty streets reflecting a gritty sky with its wet puddles, the neon signs flickering trying to maintain its dying light, and a toxic haze floating between the rusty buildings.\n\nTrash on the streets sent flying as the wheels of a raging motorcycle came blasting through the alley.\nShe looks back at the giant arm chasing her with an abnormal, fast movement, pumping into buildings.\n\n-\"Command! what's your plan to stop this mess?\" \nBB 01 asks HQ while anxiously dodging the giant arm trying to get a grip on her body.\n\n-\"Keep leading it to the rendezvous point and we'll deal with it there, you should find BB 02 waiting for you!\" Command answers through the jittering Radio.\n\nThese were the last words she heard while crushing into a wall of giant debris along the alien arm.\nDragging her numb body out of the pile, she pauses as she sees BB 02 gazing at an unsettling view.\n\nShe tears up knowing the time has finally come.\n\n\nArtwork by: XENOTRIP\n\nJPEG: 3200x4000 px\n\nTop bidder will receive BB#01.",
