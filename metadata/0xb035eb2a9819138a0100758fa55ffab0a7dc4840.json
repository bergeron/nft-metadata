    "description": "Walking doors\n\n\"Doors are like portals that lead us to a world unseen\"\n\nThere I was, in a state of dilemma, searching for a door that leads to freedom, not knowing which way to go. What if I do it differently. If I take two steps forward, would I get hit? or if I take a step backwards, would I be left behind? \n\nThese are the issues; Challenges and Choices.\n\nChallenges have a way of keeping us in the dark; creating an illusion around us that the doors of breakthrough are farther away than it is. It's like every time we take a step and try to reach a door that leads to freedom, the door walks two steps away from us.\n\nBut what if the doors are walking towards us?\nWhat if the doors are closer than we think?",
