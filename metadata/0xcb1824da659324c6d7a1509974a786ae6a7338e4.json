    "description": "Liv Boeree is a former professional poker player, master of game theory, systems thinker, and keen understander of the world of complex systems and the human experience.\n\nShe also is one of the few people out there in the world teaching about the lessons of Moloch— the study of human coordination—and is the reason why we wanted to have her on Bankless.\n\nIn the episode, Liv makes it clear how Moloch is more than an idea. Coordination and competition failures are happening in every aspect of our lives. Is crypto the solution?\n\nArtwork derived from the timestamp [14:05 - 14:24]: *[Moloch] is the god of the unhealthy competition. It’s not the god of competition, competition is a neutral thing. it’s a form of an interaction, just like coordination or cooperation.* \n\n*Competition can be used for good. And it can can be used for bad. Moloch is when competition is used for ill.* \n\n10% of proceeds donated to Bankless DAO.",
