    "description": "I always enjoying from  portrait photography, especially black and white, because I believe that in black and white photography regardless of any color or Distractions , we are   directly make a connection with the   characters and spirit of the photos and engage with the subject's emotions. In this collection, I was interested to show my world and my feelings in portrait photography as I always see, in the same way  I always look at the faces in a fictional and exaggerated shapes  and I like to change the forms and show  the characters in an unusual way and for creation of this collection  I  was inspired by many  cinematic images.",
