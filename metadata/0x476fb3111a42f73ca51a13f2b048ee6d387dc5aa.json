    "description": "Photography by Jeanine Holowatuik\nSaskatchewan, Canada\n\nUnder truly dark skies, in a remote area of the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, Canada - the night shines! Captured during the limited hours of darkness available during late May. \n\nIt's a delicate balance of darkness and aurora activity this time of year and when the conditions align, it's a magical scene. As the river raged below, the sky danced above.",
