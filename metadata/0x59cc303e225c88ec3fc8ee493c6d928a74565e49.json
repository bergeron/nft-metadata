    "description": "O, I have suffered\nWith those that I saw suffer! A brave vessel,\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\nDashâ€™d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\nAgainst my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.\nHad I been any god of power, I would\nHave sunk the sea within the earth or ere\nIt should the good ship so have swallowed and\nThe fraughting souls within her.\n\n~ William Shakespeare",
