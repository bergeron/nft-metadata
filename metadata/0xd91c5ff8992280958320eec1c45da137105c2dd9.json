    "description": "Resin Water represents my passion for the ocean and my love for experimentation in my artistic process. \n\nThis piece was created with acrylics and resin, using spoons as my primary tool for painting. This technique allows me to create organic patterns and textures that perfectly capture the movement and flow of the sea. It also adds a unique quality to my paintings that cannot be achieved through traditional brushstrokes. \n\nI use epoxy resin to add an extra layer of depth and texture, giving my artwork a 3-dimensional quality that makes it come alive.  I am always fascinated by the way the resin reflects the light, creating a shimmering effect that perfectly captures the surface of the water.\n",
