    "description": "Piet Mondriaan [ˈpitər ˈmɔndrijaːn]\nDe Stijl\n\nComposition with Red, Yellow, Blue, and Black\n\n1921\n59.5cm x 59.5cm\n\nMondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: \"Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise it would have no value for man.\" \n\n////////\n\nMeta Art Conversions are about evolving modern & contemporary art into the metaverse while also showing there’s more to them than meets the eye. Traditional musea can only show the work in a single state, the metaverse can show them in ongoing states, moving, interacting, changing. Showing these art pieces in new ways while retaining their historic value.",
