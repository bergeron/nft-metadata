    "description": "Data Poets Viz is a series of tokens displaying data visualizations, created by me based on data I collected throughout my journey as an indie developer in the Web 3.0 space.\n\nFrom Birth is the genesis token of the series, unveiling the correlations between origins and their latents' ages. When looking at the entire poets population, ages are roughly distributed in a bell curve. However, they are not distributed randomly across origins. \n \nSome origin families tend to gravitate around a certain age range. And although the origins themselves do not posses a visible age trait, their appearance does tell us something about how they affect their latents.",
