    "description": "With only around 100 adults left in the wild, the Amur leopard could be the most endangered big cat on Earth.The Amur leopard is a nocturnal animal that lives and hunts alone - mainly in the vast forests of Russia and China. During the harsh winter, the hairs of that unique coat can grow up to 7cm long. Over the years the Amur leopard hasn't just been hunted mercilessly, its homelands have been gradually destroyed by unsustainable logging, forest fires, road building, farming, and industrial development.",
