    "description": "This card depicts an individual who is highly driven to achieve their goals and may be willing to disregard the feelings of others in their pursuit. This person is not fond of competition and can be vocal in expressing their opinions, regardless of whether they are solicited or not. They are willing to go to extreme lengths, even if it means defying death or manipulating time, to accomplish their objectives. \nThe phrase \"the end justifies the means\" accurately captures this person's approach to success. Although their tenacity and ambition are admirable, it's important to acknowledge that their unwavering focus may affect their relationships with others.",
