    "description": "Poem I wrote on 03/22/2000. 1st Featured poem of my ebook \"20 Years of Darkness.‚Äù\n\nI wrote this poem when I was in a very dark space, struggling with drug addiction. I was 17 years old and growing into an adult with the emotional intelligence of a toddler. Physically and emotionally abused from a young age, exposed to drugs and violence my whole life.\n\nMy Dark Life\n\nMy life...What can I say?\nEternal darkness and mayhem put me at bay.\nI have no control.\nMy life, it is not mine.\nInnocence was never in me.\nDarkness is and always will be.\nHe controls my life.\nHe raped me of my soul, beliefs and care for humanity.\nI've become numb, no life of my own.\nMy body is a shell of my life as a whole.\nContinuing downward...Darkness stalking my soul.\nNo human compassion.\nDarkness is home.\nI have no savior, no soul of my own.\nHell is where I should be - burning forever, for the sins of my life.\nI wish to be saved, but no one can help me.\nI am alone in this darkness. I am all by myself...\n\n \n",
