    "description": "“Damian was having a nightmare: He couldn’t control the element of fire anymore and he didn’t know why. Was it his fault? The end of the world was happening and he couldn’t do anything to stop it. So the purest feeling of anger and surrender dominated him. After this nightmare, he would do or give anything, even his own life so it'd never occur.” \n\nThis piece is also a beautiful way to illustrate a quote I love from Friedrich Nietzsche: “he who has to be a creator always has to destroy”. \n\nAlong with 2D illustration, animation and music, I wanted to turn the feelings of anger and destruction into the beginning of a collection full of fantastic experiences.",
