    "description": "Growing up Catholic I was always fascinated w/ religious mythology and iconography.\n\nThe prayers and experiences forever etched in my brain. The symbolisms sprinkled throughout my life in various times of fellowship.\n\nIn losing my mother, I was the closest I’ve been to death. Feeling her warmth leave her from my touch made me want to reconnect spiritually on a personal level, shedding sins and forgiving others. \n\nMagdalena speaks to finding grace in darkness.  \n\nDimensions:\n4000 × 5000\n\n1 - 16x20 inch fine art print available for collector.\n\nMore info:\nf80nft.com/magdalena",
