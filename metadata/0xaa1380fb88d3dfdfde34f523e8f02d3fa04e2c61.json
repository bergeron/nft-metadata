This was an unforgettable day in my life as a photographer I have seen so many waterfalls but among them this was one of the biggest ie, tumpak sewu waterfall east java Indonesia.. to reach the location which was very risky as we needed a guide along with us. The day we planned to go the  weather was very bad and rainy too as there were no vehicles allowed we needed to walk 3km I came across  so many small water falls. There I met a beautiful couple and she was ready to be our model I carried a red dress with me as I had a hope that I will find someone there finally I was so happy that I took the picture which was in my dream\n\nNIKON Z6\nNIKON 14-30 F4\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nDimensions: 5640 x 4024\n\nMedium: Digital Photography\n\nPhotographer: Abhishek c jayaprakash\n",
