    "description": "At dawn, the first rays of the sun dissolve the dreams of night dreams and a new day comes into my bedroom, gently turning down the edge of the blanket, they caress my body, gently warming and playing with sunlight on the walls.\nThe wind rustles the light, transparent curtain of the window, beckoning me with its whimsical dance. A chorus of awake birds sings their morning song, inviting me into the new day:\n- Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! :)"
