    "description": "Altogether in Hunger is a concept illustration based on almost each and every of your personal experience when you and your colleagues dwell in hunger after working for a long period of time. How it feels to immediately want to swallow the food in front of you. Isn't it a first come first serve kind of thing? \n\nAs a first hand experience, hotpot is always my to-go food after working for a whole day and together with friends, it is indeed a nice experience to dwell on it together. \n\nI wish you all get to dwell happily on your food along with your colleagues! \n\n3509 x 4963 px \n\nCommercial use of the artwork is strictly prohibited",
