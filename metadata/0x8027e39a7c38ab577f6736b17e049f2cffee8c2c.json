I would like to live in an area of ​​only 1 square meter; Protect me from the horror of death!\n\nJust as a star can shine for almost eternity in this endless sky, I can wait here with the same patience.\n\nI will not hesitate for a moment to brazenly pray to the creators of heaven and earth to live a little longer—even to eternal life.\n\nEven the proudest person can beg a worthless worm just to live a little longer\n\n- 1 SQUARE METER",
