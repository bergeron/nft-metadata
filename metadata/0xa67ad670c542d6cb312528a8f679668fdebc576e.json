    "description": "On this day I was trying and catch people just going about their days in the beach, in Folkstone, Kent.\n\nIn this image what captured my attention was the fact that the men in the photo was walking and stopped there just looking at the war boat at the far. And I thought it was very interesting and started thinking about what kind of thoughts he could be having.\n\nBut then it is none of my business so I left with my own thoughts.",
