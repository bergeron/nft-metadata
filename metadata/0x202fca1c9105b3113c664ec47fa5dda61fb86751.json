    "description": "The depths of my heart has a treasure chest, unopened,\nunseen by the depths of the heart of the ocean,\nI redo, relook, realign my steps forward,\nbut the only way that appears is to move within...\n\nI try, I fail, I move, I resign,\nThere's nothing more beautiful than this loop divine,\nlessons, life, love lights my soul,\ni am awakened to my deepest pore...\n\nTalk, they said talk to someone, loud and clear,\nyet the softest conversation with myself, worked,\nI am here, I am alive, self belief is not linear,\nit gave me purpose, and i am more than ready to conquer,\nevery fear...\n\n- Ashwini Dodani",
