    "description": "Women are special humans. there's something baffling among women, their uniqueness not to mention their fierceness and tenacity when dealing with issues. They play a huge role in almost all parts of society from households, communities, institutions, churches, festivals, and even culture. \n\nIn the frame is a picture of Iyawo Ile Oba (King household wives) in one of their societal forms where their duty is to sweep the palace every year. The importance of this is to make the palace neat for the festival and also thank God for another celebration year.",
