    "name": "Pride in love",
    "description": "What's so sinful about love?\nRejected. Criminalized. Harassed. Fear instilled. \nLove, a woman of incomparable beauty. She enjoys a place of pride, flexes her body and as she does she reveals every contour of elegance. The profile highlights her near perfect features. The arms arise from shapely shoulders and taper down to narrow wrists adorned with Pride branded bracelets, her features are angular, and the curls exiting her tresses are reminiscent of the Kishangarh look. Several pearl strings ran down her voluptuous breasts, one of which was adorned with a heart pendant and nearly reached her navel. As she lifts her arms, the short choli she is wearing stretches across her bosom. The odhini drapes smoothly down her back, covering her head.\nShe, with a burst of colours rises in glory. \nUnconventional and Unapologetic. To live and love. \nTaking pride in love, since the 60's.",
