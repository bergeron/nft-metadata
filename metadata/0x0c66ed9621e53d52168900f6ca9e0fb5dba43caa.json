    "description": "…Mushrooms are one of the oldest and least studied life forms that holds many mysteries…\n\nIn the beginning I had only simple construction drawing and went far beyond it by experimenting with oil paint. All details/colours were searched and found in the process of creation.\n\nI’ve spent more then 1.5 years on this painting. Started working strongly motivated and after completing foreground, which took almost 6 month, got stuck on background. It was a year I suffocated, cause I just couldn’t find the right background to fit such detailed and colourful mushrooms, so I just kept redoing it for a year till I got the simple and perfect sky that you see on the picture.",
