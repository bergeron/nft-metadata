    "description": "PRICELESS [Once we've minted the first 5000 NFTs, we'll start burning tokens. During the first collection of 5000 NFTs, each wallet will have the opportunity to mint a maximum of 10 NFTs. If you choose to burn 10 NFTs, you'll be rewarded with 5 tokens from the next supply of 2500 NFTs. In other words, the minimum number of NFTs you need to burn to receive an NFT from the next 2500 NFTs collection is 2. Tokens from the next supply can be accessed by scanning them through a manual reveal process.",
