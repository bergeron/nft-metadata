    "description": "Naked Thoughts, a series by skeenee. \n\n\"They Stare\" is skeenee´s personal interpretation of the \"Act\" by Olexander Arkhipenko (1887-1964).  \n\nLaying exposed before your eyes. You stare. You stare. But do you truly see?  \n\nThis work, inspired by one of the museum’s classical pieces, was created on the occasion of \"Alternative Dimensions\", the first NFT Collection with the Andrey Sheptytsky National Museum in Lviv, curated by Eleonora Brizi for V-Art. \n\nProceeds from the sale will be used to support the functioning of Ukrainian museums, to aid preservation at the National Museum in Lviv, to rebuild the Chernihiv Regional Art Museum, and the Kharkiv Art Museum, which suffered great damage during the hostilities.\n\nMinted on Manifold & stored on ARweave.",
