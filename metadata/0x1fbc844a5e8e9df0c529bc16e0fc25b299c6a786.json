    "description": "A View To Kill\n\n5304x6630px\n\nStanding on top of the tallest building in the city...it is almost silent with nothing but the feint sound of cars far beneath your feet. You feel the cool breeze against your skin and you've never felt more alive, yet never more at peace with the world.\n\nI come up here as an escape, to reflect on my journey thus far and think about the positive impact I want to leave on the world. In Toronto everybody is always rushing, without taking a moment to take in the world around them. But the beautiful thing about photography is it allows us to pause time and soak in the beauty of the city which is so often ignored.\n\nCome on a journey with me and take in the beauty of 'A View To Kill'.",
