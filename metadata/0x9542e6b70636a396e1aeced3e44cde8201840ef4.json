    "description": "\n‘Seasons of Festivals’ (SOF) series depicts the celebration of people, colours, lights, carnivals, spirituality,  life, music, and poetry. SOF reimagines the world by capturing the essence of the different seasons, moving from the foliage of Spring to the light of Summer,  then the purple skies and fireworks of Autumn before circling back to to Winter: the end of the year’s journey and the hour of welcoming the new year. \n\nThe SOF series is infused with joy, colours, time,  movement, expressions and excitement, all inspired by the myriad of beautiful festivals celebrated around the world. Her paintings capture the warmth of the street’s thrum with music and kaleidoscopic parades. In the SOF series, we see glimpses of traditional rituals combined with new age metaverse festivals. Nanda invites you to embrace local and global cultures melting into an explosive fusion. \n\nNanda has created a total of 12 NFTs in 2D for the SOF series.\n",
