    "description": "Inspired by the Iconic \"Red Pill Blue Pill\" Scene From 1999 Matrix movie ,this animation visualizes me the artist choosing to stay in Web3(the matrix) as a free artist to create whatever I want whenever I want or to stay in the real world and be directed to what the clients what , the outfits are direct representations of what I'd love to always wear and what i always wear , as an african based artist i cant wear a puffer atall if i don't want heat to kill me so web3 has my avatar wearing the puffer cos he can be anything he wants unlike the real me that mostly wears tracksuits  ",
