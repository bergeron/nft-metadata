    "description": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates - Contax T3 - Cinestill 800T (2019)\n\nI love basketball. This picture is taken during the yearly Sole DXB event in Dubai. As a part of Nike's activation area there was a live basketball game being played by local talent.\n\n--  \nMy name is Funs, I am an enthusiast for a lot of things. Including Web3 and new innovations. Additionally, film photography is one of my big hobbies. The feeling of capturing something, waiting for the actual results, and sharing that with the world is a thing of beauty.\n\nWeb3 now gives creators the power to immortalize creations on the blockchain and I would love for some of my favorite pictures to live forever.",
