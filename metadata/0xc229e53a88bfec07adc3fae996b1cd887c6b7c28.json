    "description": "MODERN 3D BUILDING AT ITS BEST\nDesigner 25m42, and Multi-Platinum producer Aeneas Middleton exceptionally crafted, score, striking in character, with completely different hue dynamics – the \"Simulated\" is 25m24 and Middleton’s first collaboration NFT project: classic piano, sharp notes, with distinctive 3D rotation. A stunning female body sculpted and a unique suspended animated position. 25m42 combines incomparable building quality with Sidefx Houdini and Zbrush software, and Cinema 4d and redshift for rendering. Middleton produced a music score using software from Roland's SRX Orchestra to create striking, natural piano notes that sounds like it came out of HBO's Westworld. Middleton wanted to bring the vision of 25m42's artistic creation to life. Edition of 777.",
