    "description": "A journalist in one country was silenced by the government for talking about the government's harassment.  Both firing rubber bullets at the upper level of the fuselage.  The rubber bullet shooting incident left one person blind for life.  and in addition to silence the fact that the state mixes chemicals in the water, causing redness when sprayed with water  If water mixed with chemicals gets into the eyes, it will cause irritation and burning eyes, must be washed immediately.​  In addition, their water spraying method is also against universal standards as they do not spray over the heads of the protesters, but inject them to the torso, resulting in the force of the water jet causing the protesters to fall thin.  The person fell and hit his head on the ground and lost consciousness.  Many police officers attacked people by stomping.  To make matters worse, they were youths.  I viewed it as an act of extreme violence.  There are many news that are closed.  I won't let it be silent!",
