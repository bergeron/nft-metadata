    "description": "Old Armenian legend. According to the tale, an Armenian princess named Tamar lived on the island and was in love with a commoner Azat. This man would swim from the shore to the island each night, guided by a light she lit for him. Her father learned of the man's visits. One night, as she waited for her lover to arrive, her father smashed her light, leaving the man in the middle of the lake without a guide to indicate which direction to swim. He drowned and his body washed ashore and, as the legend concludes, it appeared as if the words \"Akh, Tamar\" (Oh, Tamar) were frozen on his lips.",
