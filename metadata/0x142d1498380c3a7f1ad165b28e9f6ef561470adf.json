    "description": "This is my genesis on Foundation. The series is called Lost Souls and this piece is based in Kensington Ave. \n\nThis place drew me in simply from the atmosphere one picks up from here. It has one of the worst Opioid pandemics worldwide and i was shocked to see the state of this area even coming from South Africa. The movements of some of the people motivated me to show it in my own sight. This is a style i've always dreamt of pursuing so i'm happy to have started with this genesis and from when i first saw this street i knew i wanted to start here. \n",
