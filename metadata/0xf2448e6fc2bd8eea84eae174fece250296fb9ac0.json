    "description": "These digital HSST Bricks are the virtual embodiment of the very physical Bricks from which these historic buildings were constructed so many years ago. Each digital HSST Brick purchased in the virtual world will help to fund the restoration of its counterpart in the physical world. Just as these magnificent buildings were originally built physical Brick by physical Brick generations ago, together we will fund the restoration of these historic buildings, digital HSST Brick by digital HSST Brick, today.",
