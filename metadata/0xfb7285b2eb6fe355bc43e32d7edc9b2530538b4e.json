    "description": "Amanda Laura Martin sobbed softly, burying her head in her arm. Her curls spilled onto Andrew's broad shoulder, and he carried her away from the bullies at the playground. \n\n\"They were mean to me,\" Amanda said, her voice muffled by her arm and his hard exterior.\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, doing his best to bend his circuits to make his voice softer.\n\nShe looked up into his expressionless face, and he returned her gaze as he carried her. \"You won't forget me one day, will you Andrew?\"\n\n\"No, Little Miss,\" he answered.\n\n\n\n\nAdjective submitted by Nick Troy.  \nInspired by Isaac Asimov's The Bicentennial Man.",
