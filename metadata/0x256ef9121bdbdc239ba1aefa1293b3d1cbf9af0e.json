    "name": "In to the storm",
    "description": "The night was calm with a slight breath of warm summer breeze blowing across my face. Blinded by darkness, no one around, quiet, an eerie feeling that sends shivers right through my body. Waiting in anticipation for the next lightning strike that illuminates the sky, not knowing where it is going to land. Is it safe here? Probably not, but I am determined, I want this shot.\n\nSeconds turned into minutes, my heart racing, the storm was inching closer. I needed to make a decision soon, do I risk it here a bit longer or do I shift position? The latter didn't make sense, all I had was open fields.\n\nExhilaration kicked in as the moody sky lit up! The crack of thunder was phenomenal, almost instant, loud. The feeling you get when you look at the back of your camera and know you have the shot. This is it.",
