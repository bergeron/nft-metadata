    "description": "私の夢は日本の四季を全部見ることです。既に春、夏、秋は見たのであとは冬だけです。\nMy dream is to see all four seasons in Japan. I have already seen spring, summer and autumn, but I have not seen winter yet.\nI have chosen Japanese patterns for their geometric elements and would like to describe their meaning.\n\n矢羽根　Yabane (Arrow feathers)\nSince the arrow has the meaning of \"shooting the target\", it has been used as an auspicious pattern since ancient times. So for me this means achieving my goal, so I used the arrow pattern to the winter quarter of this work.\n\n桜散らし　Sakura Chirashi (Scattered cherry blossoms)\nPeople believed that cherry blossoms signaled a year of good harvest. The symbolic flower of the spring also represents new beginnings, prosperity and good luck.\n\n七宝繋ぎ　Shippou Tsunagi\nThe pattern continues forever on all sides, and the luck is very good, so it is a luck pattern that evoke the prosperity of descendants and the harmoniousness of the couple.\n",
