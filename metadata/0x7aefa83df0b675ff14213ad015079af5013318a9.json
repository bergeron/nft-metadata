    "description": "This artwork is in jpeg format with the size of 500x600mm.\n\nAbout the scene: This is a scene from a post-catastrophic world where only uncle species live. In this new order, uncles fight, make love, earn money and piss on fires. They love, they lose, they fight, they rejoice, they laugh, they fear, they struggle, they do sports, music, art, and they fight again. They show their presence in every aspect in this toxic and radioactive world, where new life forms arise on the old remains.\n\nThe multi-jointed giant uncle who appears in the center of the scene is Uncle Cherry. There are many humanoid uncles in the concept of \"New Asia\" around him. They have reinvented the Go Game and playing it with/on him. The old remains of a sea and Uncle Cherry's body itself is a special place to play this game together for these Go lover uncles.\n",
