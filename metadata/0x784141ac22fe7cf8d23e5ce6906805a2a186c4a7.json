    "description": "Nature has always fascinated me with its everchanging and transforming dynamics and how it always refreshes itself.\n\nSpring is the season we observe this in its most apparent and vivid form with bright colors, blossoms and green leaves, giving a fresh boost to our lives.\n\nI love to watch the rivers flow. I feel they resemble life. Sometimes the flow is intense and strong, reaching out to its destination in a fast and determined way. Sometimes we see waterfalls on the way, sometimes serene and calm currents. There are rocks of different sizes on the path, both above and below the surface. As the waters meet those rocks, the pace of the flow slows, waters swirl, but eventually finds itself a new path to flow, adjusting to the circumstances.\n\nThatâ€™s why this photo represents a celebration of life to me, a reminder of our unique capability to refresh and transform ourselves and find our own way to flow.  And, I cherish every moment I breathe in this beautiful  world we live in.",
