    "description": "Chronos is an augmented reality sculpture that is a symbolic keeper of time. \n\nCrystals of fragmented moments are held together in a state of suspension, while orbiting space; creating a constant continuum of motion in a paralyzed state.\n\n“I often wish moments could be frozen in time—trapped in amber.  While time could also somehow persist. Chronos, reflects these moments in time as well as the exaggerated moments of shattering events, captured before the fragments of the former reality settle to the ground”",
