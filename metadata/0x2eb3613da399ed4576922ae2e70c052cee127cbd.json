    "description": "Michael Bacon was born and raised on the East Coast, studied under Edward T Mullins, Milford, CT. He was awarded his BFA from University of Bridgeport, Bridgeport, CT.\n\nHe later moved to Los Angeles to continue his studies at the American Animation Institute, in North Hollywood, CA. \n\nMike's family brought him to Arizona in 1994 where he started working at Artistic III, in Mesa, AZ. He worked there until developing his own clientele and was fortunate enough to open his own shop- TATTOO U - in 2004. The shop has since closed, but Michael continues to create art and custom designs. \n\nMichael was recently diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer & cirrhosis and all proceeds from this sale will go towards Michael Bacon's cancer treatment and recovery.
