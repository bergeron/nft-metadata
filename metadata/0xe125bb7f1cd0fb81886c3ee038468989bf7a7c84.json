    "description": "A uniquely detailed style drawing inspiration from Picasso and other Cubism artists. Deep, carved and flowing wrinkles surround fractalized components of a face misshapen by futility.\n\nThe color choices are stark against the flat chalkboard like background, grounding the pieces in a state of nostalgic embrace that saves the viewer from the sometimes uncomfortable shaky linework constructing the faces that make up these pieces.
