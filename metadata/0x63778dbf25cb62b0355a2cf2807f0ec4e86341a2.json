    "description": "Last November I took a trip to NY with my mom. This trip is marked by years of back and forth with her. But, this weekend happened to be a good one. It hurts to write this as we haven't spoke in weeks. So, in some ways, I guess this is for her. \n\nI took this on a walk to a coffee shop by myself. She was resting at our air bnb. I needed coffee, I brought my point and shoot, popped in my headphones and walked a mile to a little cafe. \n\nThe weather was beautiful, the sky was blue and the trees bright. Its how I wish every day was. \n\nMy point and shoot camera was inherited from a family friend. I shot the image on Kodak Portra. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I hope you enjoy this  image and it can find a home in your heart. ",
