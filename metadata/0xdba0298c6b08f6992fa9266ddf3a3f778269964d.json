    "description": "Now the telescope is mended, we had a play with it - and what we see is just spectacular.\n\n The 1875 mechanisms built within the Telescope: The gems systems helps revealing the colours of the stars and the galaxies like no modern telescopes can do. The show is mind blowing.\n\n We found a document from the Oxford 19th Century Star Map that hinted 17 combinations of planet setting on the top of the telescope - it changed the angle and focus - and everytime, the vision was different; unseen in any books. The pushing button mechanism, embodied by the planets, were in fact some preset configuration carefully adjusted. The Mystery was getting deepen.\n\n Here are 17 high quality pictures of the Vision from the space to thank our Visionnaires for taking part so early in our Mignonverse Adventure.",
