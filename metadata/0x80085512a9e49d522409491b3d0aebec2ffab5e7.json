    "description": "\"Life in West America\" by Roope Rainisto is an epic series on so many levels. However, I noticed that I get lost in the stunning richness and beauty of the whole image, which causes me to miss some of the most interesting generative elements.\n\nWith this series, I use the Megapixel process to soften the focus on much of the image, so that the coolest parts are highlighted.\n\nI've also found that this combined approach brings a new and different type of beauty to the overall image.\n\nAs with all Megapixel artworks, no Bushi was repeated in its creation.",
