    "description": "This work celebrates the inaugural night of mannygen, a Stable Diffusion-driven Discord bot, trained on image data of the artist, manny404. Continuing his artistic practice of open\n\nsourcing his body, manny invited his collector community to create AI- generated images via a chat room command. A marathon flurry of artistic\n\nexperimentation unfolded throughout the night, culminating in a prompt series involving an imagined friendship between the artist and actor Vin Diesel. The\n\nactor's physical similarities to the artist – and his trademark emphasis on family – resonated with manny, who presents the best results of the prompts in\n\na chronological, infinitely scrolling loop, evoking the flow of the original session. The feed showcases a collective creativity in interpreting the ML- and\n\nAI- generated imagery we’re inundated in. These niche communities showcase an important understanding of softimages, their potential for semantic and visual\n\nplay. ",
