    "description": "You Are My Favourite Me is an AI collaborative digital artwork that delves into the intricate relationship between humanity and technology. By utilizing AI, this artwork challenges traditional notions of photography and offers a new perspective on how we construct and perceive our own identities.\n\nAs an artist, I am fascinated by the possibilities that arise when we blur the boundaries between human and machine. By collaborating with AI in the creation of this artwork, I hope to challenge our preconceived notions of what art is and what it can be.\n\nUltimately, You Are My Favourite Me is a contemplation on the nature of human identity and how technology shapes our understanding of ourselves and the world. It invites viewers to deeply explore their own relationship with their image and the broader cultural landscape we all inhabit. \n\nAI Generator: Midjourney | Stable Diffusion | DallÂ·e\nEdition: 1/1\nYear: 2023\nArtist: Visu_AI_Poetry\nDimensions: 1024 x 1024 png",
