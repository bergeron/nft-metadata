    "description": "Yuriy Khymych depicted St. Sophia church in various states: in the morning, at noon, at dusk, in summer, autumn, winter, under snow and surrounded by flowering trees, and so on. His images of St Sophia at different times of the day and at different times of the year can only be compared with Claude Monet’s series of paintings “Rouen Cathedral”, which the French artist painted at different times of the day. “I love St Sofia because it has an ageless soul,” Khymych used to say.",
