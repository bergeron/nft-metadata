    "description": "TERMINAL is a work that signifies an end point of liminal architecture. Spaces that are transitional challenge perceptions, and allow us to re-examine our relationship to the movement of time & energy.\n\nThe artwork features commercial advertising, disinfectants, liquid spills as stainless steel sculptures. It demonstrates how a well-designed space can affect our emotional and psychological states, and how it can create a sense of liminality that opens us up to new possibilities."
