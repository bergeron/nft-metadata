    "description": "A group of my friends play cricket on a remote beach on the Isle of Tiree, Scotland in September 2021. \n\nI lived in Scotland for 4 years and moved back to the US when I was 22. Last year, I went back to Scotland to see my close friends after almost 3 years away. The warmth of being reunited felt like the sun on its brightest day. \n\nWhile I took this photograph on a foggy and overcast day, it's fitting that the Isle of Tiree is considered to be the sunniest place in the United Kingdom.\n\nShot on 120 film.  \n\n",
