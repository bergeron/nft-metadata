    "description": "\"Nvgui\" NFT is a project native to the Web3 environment initiated by Stars Collective and developed by Euterpe. \n\t\tNygui is dedicated to creating global original IP and content. Unlike most Web3 IP projects that focus on graphic design, Nvgui will utilize the teamâ€™s extensive expertise in the film and television industry and use film and television projects as a medium to introduce high-quality original content to Web3 and a global audience.\n\t\tCentered around the world of the Nvgui Alliance, Nvgui will recruit outstanding producers and artists worldwide to produce an eight-episode miniseries, redefining the creative path of film and television IP and content with Web3 primitives.\n\t\tIn addition to building a Web3-based community of fans and derivatives around Nvgui, Nvgui NFT holders will also participate in the production of subsequent series and films as producers, contributing to the creative process to build the Nvgui Universe.",
