    "description": "Walls have ears, doors have eyes, trees have voices, beasts tell lies, beware the rain, beware the snow, beware the man you think that you know.\n\nThis photo was taken on a foggy morning. I love to shoot in the mystery of fog to get surrealism in my photos. I specifically chose the trees in the background to give the photo a spooky look. Those branches without leaves give the vibes of an old forest. The lantern adds more mystery to the photo. The model behind that cover is definitely my brother.\n\nPS: Anyone who collects 2 editions will enter a 1/1 Raffle :)",
