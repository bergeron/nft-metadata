    "description": "The JigScene Puzzle project, by Animetas, is a mix of visual art by Gustavo Viselner, music by a two-time Grammy award nominee, and tech by Lolabs and cyberh49. The puzzle consists of 12 layers. Each layer stands on its own as an art piece, and when combined and burned together, they create a magnificent harmony.
