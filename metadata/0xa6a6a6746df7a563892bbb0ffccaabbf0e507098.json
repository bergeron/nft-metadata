    "description": "At times photographs are more than beautiful landscapes and  moments, they evoke thoughts. Here is one such image ,shot on a foggy Bali morning .I didn't expect to have a human subject when I headed to shoot the Lake Beratan in the golden dawn. But to my surprise , there was this old man all alone  fishing in the middle of foggy cold lake. As the sunlight hit the water, it appeared all golden and it was as if the man was fishing in a lake of gold. Only if he had that fortunate. But ,what's pushing him to stay afloat even when life is trying to weigh him down?",
