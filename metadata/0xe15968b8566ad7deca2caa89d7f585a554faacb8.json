    "description": "A group of cats that had no owners, always fed on leftover food. One day, they ate near a power plant and, in the food, contained remains of toxic waste. Some of them, unfortunately, died and others were left with sequelae. Those who were left with sequelae procreated and their offspring were born with mutations.  Since then, both survivors and those born with mutations have decided to join forces to fight on behalf of all abandoned cats. Stray cats, cats that have no one to take care of them, that is, those forgotten by humans.  Then came Radioactive Cat Town. a collection of NFT on the Ethereum network, traded on the Open Sea, with profile cats with various characteristics, handmade by an artist with over 20 years of experience.",
