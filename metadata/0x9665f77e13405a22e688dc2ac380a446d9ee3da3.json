    "description": "Sometimes a mirror tells you a lot more than you would imagine. No matter what you have encountered up to now in your whole life, you will still see the present. It reflects the moment that you are currently in. It tells you to live that moment without worrying about the past and the future. Be transparent. Allow the light to reach the mirror and lighten the present.",
