    "description": "DREvMSCXPES-Series-I - 27 Image Limited Edition\n\n#026-DREiMRENDvR-DREvMSCXPES-Series-I\n\nFirst of a 10 series collection that focuses on dreamscape environments. I write down what I dream as much as I can remember and develop an image based on that specific dream. Or at least the part that I can remember. Dreams are an amazing experience that we as humans go through. I do believe that dreams are our connection to another dimension. And we move in and out of these dimensions through our subconscious.",
