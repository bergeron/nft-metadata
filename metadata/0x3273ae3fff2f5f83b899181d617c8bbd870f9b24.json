    "description": "Badiucao‘s most iconic political cartoon on China’s president Xi Jinping. \nIt is the first original political meme which comparing Xi as Winnie-the-Pooh. The name of the art is inspired by the famous children book ‘We are going on a bear hunt’. \nWith this work, Badiucao helps the satire grow from an inside joke among China‘s dissident community into a global Phenomenon of resistance against China's dictatorship. Winnie-the-pooh also becomes one of the most censored image in China when it is in juxtaposition with the leaders. \nThe work has been featured widely among major media like NYT, CNN, BBC, ABC and more. It has been exhibited in USA, Italy, Czech and Australia. ",
