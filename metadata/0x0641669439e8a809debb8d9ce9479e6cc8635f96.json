    "description": "\"Liberty Leading the People\" is one of the most famous works by the French Romantic painter Eug√®ne Delacroix. It was painted in 1830 to commemorate the July Revolution in Paris.\n\nThe painting depicts the uprising of the people on the streets of Paris and the revolution. In the foreground is a female figure, \"Liberty\", standing on a barricade with the flag of France in her hand. Behind her are people of various classes and ages: workers, soldiers, children and even the dead. These different characters represent various sections of the population.\n\nDelacroix uses intense colors and dramatic composition to convey a powerful message. The figures in the painting reflect the struggle of the people for freedom, and Liberty's strong stance shows the determination of the people in this struggle.\n\n\"Liberty Leading the People\" had a great impact in its time and is considered a symbolic work of the French Revolution. The painting has also been influential in many cultural fields and has been used as a reference in many branches of the visual arts, especially music videos, films and theater plays.",
