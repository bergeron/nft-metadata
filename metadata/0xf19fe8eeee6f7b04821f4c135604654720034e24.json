    "description": "LOVE IS SWEET is a collection of spontaneous photos captured and edited in September 2021. I had recently come home from being hospitalized due to stroke like symptoms. My stay was nearly a week...the longest I had ever been apart from my then 5 year old. One of the first things he gave to me while I was away, a lego creation along with a bag of gummy bears. This first 1/1 collection is dedicated to my son.",
