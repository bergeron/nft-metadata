    "description": "During warm summer evenings, many critters of the forest stir, foreboding the transition to night, from day. \n\nAs the light starts to fade, the red fox makes his appearance, being mostly nocturnal, darkness brings cover and shrouds his opportunistic ways. \n\nWith a peering gaze, his sight reacts to movement completely without faze, locked on to his subject, it is uncommon to stray. \n\nEnchanted in this moment, the fox makes his move, before you know it, youâ€™ve nothing to lose.",
