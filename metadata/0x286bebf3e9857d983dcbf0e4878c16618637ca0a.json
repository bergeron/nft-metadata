    "description": "Located on the foothills of the Karcal Mountains, on the Georgian border, of the Karcal Mountains, whose height reaches 3450 meters, the altitude of Macaheli Plateau is around 3000 meters and the weather is cool and temperate in all seasons.\n\nFor this reason, the local people living in the surrounding area, mostly engaged in animal husbandry, close their homes during the summer months and migrate to their homes on the plateau for a few months with their animals.\n\nDuring the autumn months, when I lived in the part of Macaheli within the Turkish border, there was constant fog, as in the same period of every year, and the visibility was sometimes narrowed by 2 meters.\nThe jerry-built houses, which the temporary residents had built themselves with corrugated metal sheets and nylon tarpaulins, often appeared in a fairy-tale way above the mist.",
