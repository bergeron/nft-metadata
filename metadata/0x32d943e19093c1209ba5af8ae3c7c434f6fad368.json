    "description": "There are an almost infinite number of ways to wrap a string around a set of keks. On the surface it may seem like a simple concept, but prepare to have your mind absolutely blown by the variety of combinations the Museum of Memeist Art has produced. Each “Pinger” is a 1/1 and is derived from the brains of DevonFigures & 0xDurkle, painstakingly sketched and vectored for your viewing pleasure in any browser. Feature variations include peg count, peg size, eyes, and background, and a few memetastic flourishes for good measure.",
