    "description": "1/1\nChronos Aeon by Binx\n\n\"Chronos Aeon was the primordial god of time. He and his consort, the serpentine goddess Ananke enveloped the primordial world-egg in their coils and split it apart to form the ordered universe of earth, sea and sky. After this act of creation, the couple circled the cosmos, driving the rotation of heaven and the eternal passage of time.\n\nChronos was depicted in Roman mosaics as Aeon, eternity personified. He holds a wheel inscribed with the signs of the zodiac and Gaia (Mother Earth) usually reclines at his feet. Poetry of the period describes Aeon as an old man with long, white hair and a beard, but mosaic-art presents a youthful figure.\"",
