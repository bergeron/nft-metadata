    "description": "Inspired by the Japanese Yokai, the Futakuchi-onna ( two -mouthed woman ), often represents a woman deprived her needs.\n\nAs 'woke' as our culture claims to be, it's not uncommon for people to repress their emotions. Emotions however never go away, and surface in other ways. Often times, long repressed emotions resurface festered and more intense. Much like a ravenous wolf, its hungry for attention and needs to be validated.",
