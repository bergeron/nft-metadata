    "name": "The Last Supper",
    "description": "“Poesia com Elos” is a photographic project featuring common people conceived by conceptual artist Pamela Facco. Regardless of how a human body presents itself socially, at “Poesia” it will be undressed, welcomed, accepted and blossomed into art.\n\nThe Last Supper is an extremely popular subject in the visual arts, with various derivative works produced by many painters since the 15th century. Poesia com Elos’ interpretation intends to renew the concept of the original work and offer it a divergent critical path just as rich in details and hidden meanings. What if The Last Supper could gain a renewed relevance for contemporary society?\n\nThe Last Supper is Pamela Facco’s Genesis NFT piece, minted with sponsorship by Casa NUA, bridging groundbreaking non-English speaking artists to the English-only NFT space.\n\n7379 x 2967 jpeg.
