    "description": "Black Cards were born to celebrate Black Excellence.\n\nThe concept of traditional playing cards that only depict one race is an acceptance that kings and queens are only white. This work is the correction of that concept.\n\nMy artistic purpose is to empower, uplift, glorify and convey the emotions of black and brown people living in America. I use digital art as an instrument to inspire social change and to position Black and Brown people in spaces where they are underrepresented.\n\nThe winning bidder will receive a 16”x20” canvas print featuring this playing card.\n",
