    "description": "There once was a noisy GLSL shader  \nWho was also a very rude boy  \nHe'd cause all kinds of chaos  \nWith his pixelated joy\n\nHe'd flicker and flash  \nOn the screens of all kinds  \nDistracting and annoying  \nLeaving users behind\n\nBut despite his misbehaving  \nNo one could deny  \nThe beauty he created  \nWhen he was running high\n\nSo if you see this noisy boy  \nIn your code or on your screen  \nTry not to get too angry  \nIt's just his way, it seems\n\nBut do be sure to tame him  \nAnd keep him in check  \nFor he can be quite dangerous  \nIf he gets out of control, so to speak\n\nSo let the noisy GLSL shader  \nDo his thing with all his might  \nJust be sure to keep him in line  \nAnd everything will be alright.",
