    "description": "<p>\"Tyrra's Tower, rumored in some corners of the world to be little more than a story created to frighten children into proper behavior, stood fast against the storm; seeming to offer a promise of escape from nature's wrath. Were I not a troublesome child, who was often warned that Tyrra would come and steal me away to their dungeon, it's likely I would've sought refuge within its walls.\"<br /><br />The fourth installment in a sporadic series of artwork created based on the lore of a fantasy world I've been slowly creating over a number of years as a setting for a custom D&amp;D campaign. Downloadable image file included.</p>",
