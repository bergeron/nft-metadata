AND HERE I STAND\n\nAnd here I stand. \nThere is nothing else but the old world. \nThe soul has broken. \nSo let us have that storm. \nAnd be glad that there are no stars to break. \nThere is no water upon the face.\nBut what are words. They are the manna of man. \nYes, and they are all that men still have. \nThe face of the world is lean and white. \nMmmmmmmm! Here I am. I'll remember. ",
