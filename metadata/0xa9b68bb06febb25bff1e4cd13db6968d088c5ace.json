    "description": "The Touch (El Toque), some connections are so strong that they can go against all physical law.\n\nIt presents a magical, unique and powerful connection between two people. It represents how subtle and how wonderful a simple contact, a simple touch can be. Talk about how the right person can get your feet off the ground and make you levitate just by being around.\n\nThe protagonists are Glenda Sánchez and Javier (Tulio) Peláez, dancers from The Concept dance company. This photograph does not have any digital effect, the final result is the effort of the dancer.\nThis photograph has brought me endless satisfaction, including the Landscape Dance award at the Alicia Alonso International Photography Contest.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CVlJMVrjU7y/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\nhttp://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2021/10/28/dan-a-conocer-premiados-del-concurso-internacional-de-fotografia-de-danza-alicia-alonso-2021/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tv/CbsK-gdgRJX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link",
