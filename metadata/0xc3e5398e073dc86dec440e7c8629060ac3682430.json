    "description": "I'm a dreamer and an adventurer. I've travelled the world, shared stages with my all time favourite bands, and met countless beautiful souls along the way. I am immensely grateful for that. Yet, such blessings come with sacrifices...\n\n\"Bella\" delves on the heart-wrenching emotions that arise when you feel someone you hold dear slipping away—a bond that, deep down, you know is destined to end.\n\nDrawing from personal experience, this song embodies the difficult crossroads I encountered when my relentless pursuit of music forced me to choose between love and my dreams.\n\nFollowing a life-changing year and the successes of my sold out Music NFTs, including my 888 Love Letters, I am thrilled to release \"Bella\" as a digital treasure, making it more accessible to my devoted community on this unique occasion.\n\nDon't forget to \"leave me a note\" xxx\n\nWritten by Josh Savage.\nProduced by Jonathan Kluth in Berlin.",
