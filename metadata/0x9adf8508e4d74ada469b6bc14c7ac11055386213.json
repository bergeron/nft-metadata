    "description": "Hybloricus City was built among the high mountains and was truly an ever-growing metropolis.  \nIts elegance with the background of misty mountains and black clouds added a certain grandeur to the city.  \nThe climate these skies brought was of great importance, \nbut they were also influential when it came to architectural designs as the vast majority of buildings have been built to great heights, \nas if to try and reach the blue skies above them.  \nBut now the once great city is filled with weapons, blood, and body parts. Red, Silver, and khaki are the new colors of a city that was once a symbol of beauty and grandeur but has now become the scene of a brutal war.  \nThe air that normally carried the voices of well-dressed people of royal blood and big tools was now deafeningly loud, the screeching drowning out every other sound in the area, a sight of pure nightmares.  \naaah... \nWars.. wars... wars...  \nThey were always around the corner,  \nand we will never see any end to this. \n\n\n8192 x 8192px",
