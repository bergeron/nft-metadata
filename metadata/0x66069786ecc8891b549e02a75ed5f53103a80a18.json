    "description": "Holly Shannon, producer and host of the Culture Factor podcast, is a Web3 enthusiast, jewelry designer, and blockchain entrepreneur. After a house fire put an abrupt end to her jewelry business, she applied her passions elsewhere, and her podcast was born. Culture Factor shares the NFT stories of artists, collectors, and businesses with a world still learning about Web3. Holly's journey has been fascinating; from the house fire to the blockchain, her jewelry designs are now coming to life once again via a collaboration with artist Elizabeth Franklin. Every Culture Factor NFT is wearing a jewelry piece designed by Holly Shannon.",
