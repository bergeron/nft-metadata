    "description": "Clocktower style buildings always bring a unique aspect to the adventure. From the well kept original spiral staircases to engravings from construction workers in the early 20th century, exploring old architecture takes me back in time. This photo is from Boston's tallest point from its completion in 1915 to 1965, the \"Custom House Tower\".  For over 20 years now, just some feet behind where I am standing, there is a falcon's nest. Luckily at the time we explored this landmark, no one was home.",
