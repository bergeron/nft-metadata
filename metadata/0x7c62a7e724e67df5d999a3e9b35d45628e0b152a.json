    "description": "This is a model that I created in blender 3.0 after studying for a few weeks. I used a flat panel cube, then lowered the height and played around with the terrain. Added some vegetation, roads and other aesthetic features.    \n\nI then used a generator to create the buildings. Good for a starting point. More 3D models and environments to come.\n\nAccept this little bundle into your home today!  Or, make an offer if you like what you see. Take care!",
