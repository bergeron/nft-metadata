    "description": "Considering one of the most famous poems of Catullus, the title of the project is Odi et amo, or refusal and obsession. Starting from an analogy in the vegetable field, in which complementary plants exist, in the figurative representation of the long branches protrude from the chest as if they were extensions of the being itself, trying to create a graft with its own complement, but the union is prevented from the photographic frame, hatred arises from here.",
