    "description": "This is a living collection to celebrate trans people. \n\nEach minted nft is a portion from the second artwork that I created with Ai:\n\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYyFRKVo3Fsk9HhxfYKJ2FFYkorfAtBrv25Ka5L59F3KK/nft.jpg\n\nMy intention is to continually add to this original artwork, mint those additions here as they are made.\n\n100% of the revenue from this collection, for all time, will be donated to transgender related charities. \n\nI kicked it off with a $2,000 donation to The Trevor Project. (Donation Date 02/19/2023 - Donation Number: 78496926)",
