    "description": "The lustful pride of lifeâ€¦ This means that you are led and primarily driven with the idea that your life will always be as it is now, and kind of having a feeling that you will live forever; instead of being aware that you are mortal, you will not live forever, and you will come under the judgment of YHWH Almighty for how you have lived in the things that you have done in his life. It's assuming that you've always got tomorrow, and living carelessly, because you assume that you always have plenty of time to turn things around. It's pride. It's not appreciating the fact that you have a limited amount of time in his life to learn and to choose and to do what is good and right, and you best make the most of opportunities to learn and do good, while you still have the chance.",
