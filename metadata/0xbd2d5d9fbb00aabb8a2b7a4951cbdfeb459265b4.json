If you look at the piece, you will see there are lots of RTFKT details. \n\n\nThe expression of the BLAST piece for me is that the moment human beings discover their own potential, they are unstoppable. This can be both mentally and physically. Socrates has a point-blank saying on this subject;\n\n\"It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.\"  \nSocrates\n\nHere is BLAST! The first piece of Stray Series.\n\n6250x6250x150  \n13.7 MB  \n12.3 Hours",
