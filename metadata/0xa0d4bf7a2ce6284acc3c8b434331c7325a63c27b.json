    "description": "May and Iris' love story began like so many modern day romances, with a couple likes, a DM, and a few weeks of (not so) casual conversation.  Although they were thousands of miles apart, they arranged to meet.  Fortunately they were able go through immigration, marry and start building a life together. \n\nProud Hands is an open edition celebrating LGBTQIA+ people worldwide. You can show your support by minting and proudly displaying this rainbow (photo of May and Iris' painted hands) in your wallet, while simultaneously raising money for The Human Rights Campaign (HRC.org); 20% of the proceeds from this primary sale will be donated.
