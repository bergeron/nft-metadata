    "description": "The Times Square in New York City is undeniably one of the busiest places on Earth. \n\nA place, where people from all over the world with all kinds of backgrounds are coming together to admire the wonders of the illuminated billboards, representing the city that never sleeps like nothing else. \n\nBut this place can also be overwhelming, which is exactly why I experienced when getting back there – captured in the movement & blurriness of this photo.\n\n\nWandering Cinematics Exhibition Piece",
