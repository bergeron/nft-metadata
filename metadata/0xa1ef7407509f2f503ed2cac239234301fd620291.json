    "description": "An unsettling presence has been felt in the lands home to the Makimono. Portals have been opening, the local plant life has been withering away, and nights have begun to drag on longer as the days move forward. \n\nWhile the adventurers aren't definite on what tribulations may be coming, a looming aura of the end times has laid waste across the lands. \n\nTime will tell, but we may be left with only one option. To burn it all and start again.",
