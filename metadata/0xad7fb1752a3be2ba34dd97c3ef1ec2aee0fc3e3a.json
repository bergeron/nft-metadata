    "description": "\"From the stars we come..to the stars we go. Life is but a journey into the unknown.\"\n\nBEYOND is a moody slice of me diving face-first into my childhood using anime as inspiration. I did this piece on my Ipad while sitting at home on New year's Eve. Below is the process video of how it came to life from start to finish. Procreate + Photoshop. 7 hours \n\nWe constantly try to peek at what lies beyond what the universe reveals. Belief and taking the leap of faith are all that will ever be needed to ascend to greater plateaus.\n\nKeep believing. Go Beyond.",
