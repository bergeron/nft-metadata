    "description": "This holiday season, CAA honors caregivers with a donation in your name to #FirstRespondersFirst and CARE, organizations that provide support to those who help others in need. We partnered with three incredible NFT artists to shine a light on the caregivers and the frontline heroes in all our lives with unique and collectible works of art. Danny Casale (aka Coolman Coffeedan) is a self-proclaimed bad animator whoâ€™s known for his wildly popular character named Spesh, who reminds millions of people around the world that they are loved, they are unique, and they are indeed special!",
