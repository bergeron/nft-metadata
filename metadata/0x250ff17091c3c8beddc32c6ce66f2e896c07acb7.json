    "description": "Loma Blanca is part of Ty Lekki's genesis series, Vertigo. The mysterious west face of the Fitz Roy massif has rarely ever been photogaphed. After years of planning and multiple failed attempts, I was finally able to get the shot I was after. It took three nights to get to the summit of Loma Blanca where I was were able to capture some of the most unique photos ever taken from Patagonia. This series will be able to viewed in VR, a complete 360, taking you high above the clouds and into the landscape. The full behind the scenes story is available on Youtube.  \n\nView Fullscreen: https://projects.transientlabs.xyz/ipfs/QmaasJNDhayA4oBhjNDLvUgedC4oY1CLaT1ZtPYqGBPPA4  \n\nFor Oculus: https://projects.transientlabs.xyz/ipfs/QmNVF71caoWZWZLmjJavyLrtwucaNMLDQQTt7BnJqrEE7i",
