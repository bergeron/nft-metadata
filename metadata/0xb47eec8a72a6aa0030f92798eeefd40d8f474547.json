Valerie Sesrep here with a developing update on yesterday's robbery of the Congo Corporation armored truck. \n\nThe latest reports indicate that the thieves made off with a staggering 2,202 data drives. While Congo Corporation has yet to disclose the purpose of these drives, their delivery log shows that they were en route to the Golden Arch Estates, home of the most rich and famous families otherwise known as 'The 1%'.\n"
