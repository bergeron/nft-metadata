    "description": "'Beacon of Hope, a Dream Come True'\nThanks to my friend Ian Norman (lonelyspeck.com) for guiding me through my 1st ever pano of the galactic core. While out on location @ the Fav√†ritx Lighthouse in Menorca w/ the PhotoPills team. We all trekked to the bus to eat dinner as we waited for the core of the Milkyway to rise and the clouds to clear. Clouds covering us, in the pitch lack of night, in a terrain that truly made you feel like you were on the moon, pushing the early hours of the morning. So, as Ian and I were walking, we started learning about each other. He happened to be familiar with my hometown of Santa Barbara because his grandparents lived near by! Over 6000 miles away in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea and I suddenly felt at home. Then our optimism paid off- the core came out, and magic was made. A reminder that if you have faith and put in the work, you'll be rewarded. ALWAYS. This is an image that was 8 years in the making from dreaming about it to capturing my dream.",
