    "description": "“Transitional Space,” showcases a busy crosswalk in New York City as the epitome of liminal space. In this transitional zone, bridging two city blocks, the crosswalk serves as melting pot; everyone experiences the transition en masse, regardless of who they are, where they’re going, or their station in life. Crosswalk as transitional zone, crosswalk as great equalizer, crosswalk as reminder that everyone has a shared moment that binds us together in the most fundamental of ways. ",
