    "description": "‘Ello loves, my name is tyler coolidge (all lowercase please) and I am an artist, producer and writer from the Bay Area, California. I’ve been on the artist-grizzle for a little over ten years now, specializing in Hip-Hop and R&B music—often a fun blend of both at the same time. I believe anyone who knows me well would say that my personality matches pretty closely to the music I make, which is usually smooth/chill and easy-going, but with sprinkles of high energy all over the place. (I’m an espresso guy)\n\nThe track I’ve decided to finish and share with you all is called “NO SCOPE,” which is produced by my good friend Future James and also features the extremely-talented Sacramento native Nate Curry, making this track an all-Bay Area collaboration! The track is easygoing, playful and catchy while also capturing an element of fun in it, which I alluded to in the last paragraph—I think this track encapsulates who I am and what I’m like pretty well. My favorite thing to make music about is the early stages of a fresh romance, where you have to choose words carefully and put on your best outfits and stuff like that, lol. It’s just a fun, nervous, almost juvenile-feeling time and “NO SCOPE” is about “shooting your shot” in those situations! Shooting your shot… no scope… get it?????\n\nI am extremely grateful to be up here on the Sound.xyz stage sharing my new art with this awesome and loving community that I’ve seen grow over the past year, and can’t wait to interact with y’all and build even more together. Thank you Sound so much for having me, and shoutout to my man Greydient for helping me get here. Plenty more to come, much love to allayall! <3",
