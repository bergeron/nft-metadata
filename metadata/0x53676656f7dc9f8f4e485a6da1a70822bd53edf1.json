The history of kwak : In 2008, the first time I went to the hotel La villa, on the heights of Calvi, I was amazed by the view from the hotel, the citadel, the sea... There was the  a pool of fresh water that mixed with sea water and became one with the horizon.  But for me something was missing, a presence.  So I looked for an animal that could live both in salt water and in fresh water.  I came up with the idea of ​​the duck and Kwak was born",
