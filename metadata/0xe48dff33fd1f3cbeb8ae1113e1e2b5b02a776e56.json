    "description": "I always look up while descending. And I always get goosebumps. \n\nIt´s that fine line between 3 worlds that fascinates me during a dive:\n\nFirst, the deep blue depths surrounding me. Intimidating, maybe even daunting at times, but holding a whole new universe full of magic and wonders, intriguing my curiosity to explore what lays beyond surface.  \nSecond, this mysterious source of light reaching down from the sky. Illuminating the unknown, making this liquid cosmos visible to the human eye and therefore connecting the above with the below.  \nAnd third, the fine line of the water surface that seperates more than 70% of our planet from the land we live on.\n\n\"Ocean´s Milky Way\" conveys that feeling of crossing the borders of three galaxies. \n\nWe are all just tiny parts in an incromprehendibly huge universe. Above and below.",
