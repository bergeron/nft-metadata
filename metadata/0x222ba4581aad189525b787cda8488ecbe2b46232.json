    "description": "One poem touched my heart. It gave me a sudden halt as if it was love at first sight. Every message, every line, and rhyme. It has surged me into the author's drifting imagination. I asked myself, I'm not dreaming right?\n\nThe lines in your smile,  \nThe snowflakes in your hair,  \nIf I could pause this moment here and now,  \nAll I’d do is stare.  \nAdmiring all of your perfect imperfections  \nOne after another.  \nYour eyes would lock right onto mine  \nAnd I’d begin to stutter.  \nThe butterflies in my stomach would rise like the sun,  \nBut then I’d remember that nothings been done.  \nFor this is all just a fantasy inside my head,  \nAnd I’m just here,  \nLaying alone in my bed...\n\n(Zeeb)",
