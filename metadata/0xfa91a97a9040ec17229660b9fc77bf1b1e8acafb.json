    "description": "On January 8, 2020, flight PS752 was tragically shot down by two missiles only three minutes after takeoff from Tehran IKA Airport.\nThe victimsâ€™ families come from different backgrounds with diverse religious and political beliefs. Some are citizens of Canada, some Britain, some Sweden, some Afghanistan, and some Iran. What they all have in common, however, is the will to seek justice. Even when distinctive paths are explored to get justice, the goal and outcome is one.",
