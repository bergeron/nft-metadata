    "description": "Igor is an unapologetically Russian cat. He is a grizzled veteran of the streets steeped in history. He remembers the collapse of the Soviet Union well. Igor is always working hard to hustle passing rubes out of some treats. He doesn’t smile because his dental health is poor thanks to years of ‘free’ socialized healthcare. This is the main reason Russians don’t usually smile.",
