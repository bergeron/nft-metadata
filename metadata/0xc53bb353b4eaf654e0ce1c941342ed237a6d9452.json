    "description": "This picture is about a codependent love. A free self-portrait, reflecting the feelings and experiences of the author in a specific period of creativity. A woman literally burns in the fire of passion, but she can no longer and does not want to do anything about it. Closing her eyes, she obediently surrenders to this pernicious feeling in order to burn to the ground in it. The figure is depicted very naturalistically to emphasize a physicality, a passion, a sexuality.\n\nOil. Canvas. 110*80 cm.",
