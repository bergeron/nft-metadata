    "description": "BANGER, 2015\n———————\n\nThe layers of life in Cuba fascinate me. \n\nVisually - the old American cars, Russian bangers, crumbling buildings and palm trees form the backdrop to improvised work stations, roadside chit-chats, daily domino games, hobbies and street sports.\n\nBeneath that surface layer is where I like to explore and feel comfortable with my camera. The stories that question, provoke and give insight and a deeper understanding of life in that world. \n\n15 years after studying in Cuba I returned to this beautiful island to see what had changed, or been preserved since. It is impossible to ignore the political situation that has frozen this land and people in time. The lack of technology, infrastructure, supplies, food and wealth contribute to a society with strong community values - distracted less by digital innovation, and bolstered by reusing, and recycling.\n\n‘El fosforero’ means ‘the lighter guy’. As in - the person who fixes, maintains and resells cigarette lighters.",
