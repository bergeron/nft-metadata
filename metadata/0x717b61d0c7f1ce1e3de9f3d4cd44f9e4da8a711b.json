    "description": "by @kir_saan \n\nNew Year's St. Petersburg, night. Exhibition “404.zero Arrival”: rare visitors, flashes of light, trembling lasers, pulsating low-frequency sounds. I turn on the camera. CLICK!\n\nThis photo takes me back to the time when I was greedily and clumsily trying to get to know this world. When I made a lot of new acquaintances and caught my feelings and emotions with camera lens. Camera was my guide between the world of impressions and the reality. With it's help, I enhanced the feeling of belonging to the environment.\n\nCamera — Sony A6400\nLens — Sigma 30mm",
