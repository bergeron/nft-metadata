    "description": "Zvezdny peak is the highest point of the Ergak range (2265 m). It is a treacherous and dangerous mountain with steep walls. \n\nBefore I photographed it, the mountains were covered with thick fog. But after a while the sunlight broke through the shroud and the wind showed the top. \n\nEverything inside froze at the sight of such a sight. I had only a few seconds to capture it before the fog cleared completely.\n\nLocation Ergaki National Park, Siberia",
