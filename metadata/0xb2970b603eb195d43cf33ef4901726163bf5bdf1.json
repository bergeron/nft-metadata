    "description": "I was at a bar waiting on friends when an older woman sat next to me. This woman began to share that she was currently processing that her best friend's spiritual transition was happening. In healthier years, the two women made a pact to always travel together. Their last trip was to Ghana, where they were given intricate friendship bracelets that, \"when they fell off, or became unraveled something significant will happen in your life\". The woman gave me that bracelet, and told me “Twende\" or \"Go\". When the bracelet fell off of my wrist, I received a last minute invitation to travel and do a festival in Africa, a first time dream trip. I have been inspired to get out and go ever since. Twende!",
