    "description": "A look into the death of self, a reflection of self discovery through the loss of self. Losing yourself to find yourself, starting from the ground up, redefining self. An obvious end to the old you but shines a light on self discovery, relearning yourself, and defining who and what you want to be. Unraveling the many layers of who you used to be, allowing yourself to mourn that self in order to bloom into who you're meant to be right now. ",
