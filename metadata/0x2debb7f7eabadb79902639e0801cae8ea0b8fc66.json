    "description": "SENSEI KAERU #1\n\nSensei Kaeru is the story of how a young frog was forced to become the most skilled Sensei ninja ever known by all of the galaxy’s population. As a child, he had to endure abuse and beatings from the Hebi Klan, the most feared and extended Ninja Klan known by any living creature, forcing Hikigaeru, Kaeru’s father, to work for them with no other choice.\n\nHikigaeru has very special skills as a blacksmith, making him the best in his work as he can make some special weapons that can kill dragons or even GODS !!  \n\nOn his journey, Kaeru will have to travel to a lot of strange worlds, fight for his honor, make friend and love them, rest to get energy for competitions and make very difficult decisions, those who can take him in a bad direction or the correct way, getting him closer to this goal of becoming a Sensei.",
