Physical claim MUST occur during this window in order to be accepted. Free shipping to 100 countries.\n\nThe Parallela T-shirt is 100% made in Italy. Coming in 4 styles to select from, this T-shirt has a splash of color and comfort. This token entitles the owner to claim 1 of 4 physical T-shirt styles during the claim period, only on UNXD.com.
