    "description": "Size of the full door frame \nwidth: 130cm x height: 210cm\nthis door composes of 4 paintings representing the four seasons.\nEach measures at width 130cm x hight 50cm\nMedia: acrylic on canvas.\nMy vision despite the challenges of the climate here, with technology and innovation. Over the next 50 years, I expect a drastic change in thew climate. Having 4 seasons in the UAE will become a reality that will be positively reflected on the economy, tourism, and agriculture. \nthis is my artistic innovation, coincidentally with UAE hosting the United Climate Summit COP28 IN 2023.\nNOTE: IF THE BUYER IN UAE CAN GET THE PHYSICAL PAINTING, FOR MORE DETAILS YOU CAN CHECK MY INSTA PAGE.\n\nIn Addition it was published on Dubai Tv in program celebrating UAE national Day.
