    "description": "Who am I?  \nA very difficult question for me. Probably, I am the person whom I know the least and whom I like to know so much, although sometimes it is insanely painful.\n\nProbably, my attempts to understand myself will never end. Perhaps self-digging is a kind of art and striving for the ideal, in which a person is looking for new versions of himself layer by layer to improve himself, to go for something new, for new experiences and enrichment of the inner world.  \nArt definitely helps me in my search.\n\nNothing brings more satisfaction than a victory over yourself. Reaching new personal heights is very inspiring.",
