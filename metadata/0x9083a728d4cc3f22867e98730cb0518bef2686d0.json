    "description": "Year 2022\nEdition 1/1\n\nThe Vernonia creepers - widely known to SE Asia's horticulturalists by the moniker 'Lee Kuan Yew Creeper' - have been pruned by Nila Choo to spell the letters LKY. \n\nThe Vernonia creepers was first introduced into Singapore when “The Garden City“ was conceptualized and spearheaded by the founding Prime Minister. It is rumoured that the robust plant was nicknamed LKY creeper because it is hardy and reaches everywhere. The passing of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015 begets the question of what makes an adequate monument for him. \n\nNila Choo not only poses the question of nature versus nurture as in a nation's development, but also as a  momento mori. Power, like everything else, does not last forever.  Without constant pruning and cutting, the memory of a much feared public figure in Singapore grows back into illegibility. \n\n\n\nThe NFT owner has the right to physically install and exhibit the artwork in variable dimensions with Vernonia creepers maintaining the letters LKY. \n",
