    "description": "\"Without weapons, hatred, or violence\" wrote Spaggiari. The sensation can be found in this piece. \n\nMy vision of 2023 Mona Lisa takes place in Paris, at the Louvre, where Mona Lisa belongs. You can find it by visiting the well-known \"Salle des États\" and utilizing Augmented Reality (Artivive app) to show what lies beyond Leonardo Da Vinci's artwork.\n\nMy rendition of the Mona Lisa offers us a true art exhibition by dedicating her entire body to tattoo artists. In doing so, she transformed herself into masterpiece, like a live sculpture, with fascination, glamour, and f***ing ART.\n\n\nLicense  \nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
