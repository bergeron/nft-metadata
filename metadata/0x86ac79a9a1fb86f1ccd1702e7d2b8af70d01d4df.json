    "description": "It was a typical rush hour in the metro, with people hustling and bustling to get to their destinations. We had both been consumed by work, leaving little time for anything else. But in that crowded train car, amidst the chaos and commotion, our eyes met and it felt like time stood still. Even though we were standing just a few meters apart, I could feel our hearts racing in unison.\n\nI couldn't shake off the feeling that we were meant to talk, but I couldn't find the courage to approach you. But as fate would have it, you dropped your book and I picked it up for you. Our eyes met, and it seemed like there was no other choice but to strike up a conversation.\n\nI will never forget the sound of your melodic and soft voice, it was like music to my ears. Those moments we shared together felt like an eternity, yet they disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving only the connection of our hearts.\n\nFrom that day on, we walked together, taking in the sights and sounds of the city, sharing our passions and discovering new things together. I remember every walk we took, every laugh and every conversation. And I will always treasure the memory of our first kiss, a kiss infused with the sweet aroma of a rose.",
