What a perspective.\n\nEven when I'm focused on a subject, I always keep my eyes on a swivel to catch the \"moments in-between\".  Kind of hard to do with just one functioning eye, but I've gotten used to it over the years.  I also thought it was neat how this bird was staring at me through one eye as the other appears to be blocked by a branch. \n\n- Ro ",
