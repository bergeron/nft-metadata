    "description": "Imagine the world is a shade of gray and a little blurry; Almost as if your environmental vision is very bad. This field of vision expands to such an extent that without turning your head, you can also detect luminescent shapes and movements behind you. There is also a bright dot of color in the shape of an X that moves with your gaze. In the center of this colored spot, everything is clear and transparent. In fact, you see small windows of clear, colorful detail in translucent gray landscapes. This is how the jumping spider sees the world.\nThis species of jumping spider named Proszynskiana is in Iran.",
