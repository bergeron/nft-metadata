    "description": "**[Beyond Babel](https://www.beyondbabelshow.com/)  is a critically acclaimed dance theatre show created by Keone & Mari Madrid and Hideaway Circus. The production features large crochet backdrops and yarn-based props by singular visual artist London Kaye, costume design by Barbara Erin Delo, and lighting design by Tony Award winner Jeff Croiter and Sean Beach.**\n\nInspired by Shakespeareâ€™s Romeo & Juliet, Beyond Babel is about the division of families, friends, and a community of people as authorities decide to build a wall between them. We follow two divinely linked lovers as they reconcile with the rising tensions of a populace cut in half. \n\n*Each original NFT was photographed by Aidan Gibney and includes an original cast-signed poster and a pair of tickets to the US National Tour slated for early 2023.*",
