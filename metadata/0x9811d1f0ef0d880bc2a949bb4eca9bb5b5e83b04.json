    "description": "Summer is one of four seasons, traditionally the second, marked by the longest and typically hottest days of the year due to the inclination of the Earth and thermal lag. While working on this piece, I thought about the beach being one of the coolest places to be during summer. The sun kissing your skin, the sound of laughter and waves, the birds calling and all other excitement.\nMelanie, a young beautiful lady who is having fun at the beach. She's putting on a hat and a red bikini top and a beach hat with big wooden earrings, she also has a tattoo on chest.",
