    "description": "I began to wonder what life would be like if I dropped the act and began to trust that being myself would be enough to get the love I needed. It's when I realized it's okay to walk alone to introspect and shelter our peace of mind, just like an umbrella protecting us from the thunderstorm. We find ourselves wandering in an unknown place, yet it becomes the most familiar place because it sets us free. \n\nReal time often includes periods of silence, reflection, growth, self-forgiveness, processing with loved ones and responsibility. \n\nIf you're lost, remember. It's never too late to take the reins of our life into our own hands and find direction; it's never too late for new beginnings.",
