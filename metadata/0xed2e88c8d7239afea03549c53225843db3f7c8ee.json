He’s one of the greatest advocates of open and permissionless systems that we have in this space.\n\nIn this episode we talk about his legendary debate with SBF—this is the first time we’ve caught up with him since. What are his reflections now? We also dive into how this bull/bear cycle is similar and different from previous ones, how do we preserve crypto’s core principles, and most importantly—why are we here? Why crypto? Why now? Why stay?\n\nErik doesn’t waste a word in this episode. Let’s keep building.",
