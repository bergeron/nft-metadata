    "description": "I’d been spending time with the Hopi Tribe in Arizona. Before dinner one evening, I headed out towards a rocky outcrop I’d spotted earlier in the day. A track eventually led me to a canyon adorned with hundreds, if not thousands of petroglyphs depicting Hopi’s migration and history.\n\nAs I marveled at the ancient stories, I came across some modern day graffiti and was deeply saddened, to the point at which I cried for a while.\n\nI’d spent a very uncomfortable night sleeping on the desert floor, and I could have eaten a horse. Although tired, I was so incensed by the defaced rock art, that to calm my mind and seek forgiveness I played this piece in honor of the spirits that were watching me.\n\nOne take. Lots of mistakes. Badly mastered. Experience of a lifetime.\n\nThis NFT includes the 2011 Juan Salvador 4AE classical guitar I played in this video.\n\n(Shipping included within the contiguous United States.
