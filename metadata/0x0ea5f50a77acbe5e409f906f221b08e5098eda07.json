    "description": "Meet \"Vendy\", a futuristic vending machine.\n\nThis scene depicts a vending machine providing a vitamin that immediately improves your health without having to put in any work.\n\nThe goal is to emphasize the wester societal push towards convenience and instant gratification through the contrast of a vending machine and healthy.\n\nAre we the ones \"out of order\"?\n\nThis scene was rendered in Cycles X and modeled in Blender. The stickers and paper in this scene were handmade and hand torn and then scanned into the 3d scene and applied to the object.",
