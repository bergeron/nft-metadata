    "description": "“To be truly challenging, a voyage, like a life, must rest on a firm foundation of financial unrest. Otherwise, you are doomed to a routine traverse, the kind known to yachtsmen who play with their boats at sea... \"cruising\" it is called. Voyaging belongs to seamen, and to the wanderers of the world who cannot, or will not, fit in. If you are contemplating a voyage and you have the means, abandon the venture until your fortunes change. Only then will you know what the sea is all about.\n\n\"I've always wanted to sail to the south seas, but I can't afford it.\" What these men can't afford is not to go. They are enmeshed in the cancerous discipline of \"security.\" And in the worship of security we fling our lives beneath the wheels of routine - and before we know it our lives are gone.\n\nWhat does a man need - really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in - and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment. That's all - in the material sense, and we know it. But we are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention for the sheer idiocy of the charade.\n\nThe years thunder by, The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed.\n\nWhere, then, lies the answer? In choice. Which shall it be: bankruptcy of purse or bankruptcy of life? ”\n\n― Sterling Hayden, Wanderer.  Published in 1963\n\nSterling's quote changed my life.  It reads like it could have been written in the 2020's not the 1960s.  So here we were, three small kids on our boat SV Cirrus, bunkered down before an approaching squall line in the remote north western parts of Barbuda.   Life is to be lived; don't let a few squall lines stop you.",
