    "description": "A natural collaboration between the very talented multidisciplinary artist, Anubis, and I.\n\nAnubis' visual beautifully encompasses the poem, in which I wrote about the beauty of alignment through the scope of a fleeting sunset.\n\n\"The sun was mango marmalade\nAnd the sky went princess Peach,\nReflections on my skin hit a citrus tangerine,\nForsaking me a sweetness I'd only known heaven to forge, \nThe secret of Venus uncovered once more\n\nOf Atoms and apples\nAnd Eve-nings never alike,\nI bask in the fleetness of scenic alignment.\"\n\n\n",
