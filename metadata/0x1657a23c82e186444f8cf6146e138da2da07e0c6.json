    "name": "Most Sacred of Stones Before the Gates of Dawn ",
    "description": "Who’s action contemplates, bound in a visage of crude and indelicate earth? That golden dawn that hath many names.\nThe sorcerer’s lapis lazuli. The philosopher’s stone. Night, clutches firmly in her grip, the secret alignment of stars and planets, the tree of life before it bore the fruit of their elemental children.\nFrom the dark forest of our ignorance, we would stumble and fail, and come at last to be in her arms with the answer to her unspoken riddle. Carried on golden wings, heavy as the sun, out of the darkness, through the gates of dawn.\n\nDigital Illustration / Affinity Photo / AI\n\n3488 x 4096 px .PNG ",
