    "description": "The only discovered self-portrait of Chester and his last dated work to be found. The piece shows a looser brushstroke, perhaps by necessity due to his advancing age. His face, obscured by color—Is he winking? Or perhaps an apparent grimace, awash in pink and green. We do not know how he died, but we know that he lived 11 more years from the date of this painting, ultimately passing at 94.  \n\nInscription (from reverse):  \nYears beyond me. The lost thoughts—the forgotten ones. I creak and crow. No listener or lover. I am alone.",
