    "description": "\nShe is one of the Iranian-Aryan goddesses. He is worshiped by Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster and has great value and prestige. Anahita is in charge of guarding all the waters of the world.\nFrom the rain. Clouds of hail and wind gain power\nAnd goes to confront his enemies\nHe shines like the stars\nI think Anahita is attractive, beautiful and powerful\n\nAnd of course sometimes unkind :) ðŸ’™",
