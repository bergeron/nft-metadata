    "description": "At a masquerade ball, you can be whoever you want to be. You can conceal your identity and turn into someone else, simply wearing a mask. Currently, our digital avatars represent our Alter Egos, living in the Metaverse. With the Maskerade project we wanted to bridge physical and digital reality with a concept focused on our deep desire to constantly evolve through different versions of ourselves. So, for our FIRST DROP, we created 20 NFT Masks that deeply connect owners to their virtual alter ego through an exclusive fashion accessory to flaunt in the Metaverse. And, believe us, this is just the beginning: with a second drop (coming soon!), not only more collectible masks will be available to purchase, but everyone who got their hands on the first release will receive another NFT. That is only one example of the challenges we like to take on every day as part of our job. ",
