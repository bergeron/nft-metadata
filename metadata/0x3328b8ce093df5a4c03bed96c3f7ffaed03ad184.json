    "description": "For this photo I had one clear vision. To show it in pure geometry. So I opted for no human presence on it. Also, the fact that I took quite a long exposure would make any human presence too undefined and blurry for what I had in mind. I took this photo in January 2020, so many people were working from home and avoiding public transport due to COVID, which made it easier to achieve this solitude effect.\n\nAbout the station art:\n\nSolna Centrum opened in 1975. Artists Karl-Olov Björk and Anders Åberg opted for a bright green and red landscape. The green representing the forest and the red an evening sunset behind the trees. Once they finished they felt the piece was lacking something, so they added improvised black paintings illustrating some societal issues such as deforestation and depopulation of rural areas in Sweden.\n\nLicensing:\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
