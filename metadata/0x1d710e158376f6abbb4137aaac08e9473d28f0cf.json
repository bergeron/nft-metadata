    "description": "Human beings are no longer able to build a future, they have lost the will to improve themselves.\n\nFortunately, the artificial intelligence algorithms have been reproduced and improved, leading the robots to become totally self-sufficient, to improve the economic and working system and to make them very collaborative. \n\nThe percentage of loyal relationships between robots has risen to 98.7% in the last year, while the percentage of robots who are happy and satisfied with their lives is 96.2%.\n\nNow they are building space bases in various planets of the solar system and conducting scientific studies, their goal is the search for new life forms.",
