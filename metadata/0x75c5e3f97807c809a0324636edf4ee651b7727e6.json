    "description": "The noise and the halftone have done it to me. These textures and poppy colors define my style. I'm attracted to the non-perfect, so I never work for too long on one piece, but always create and publish directly. As a trained architect, however, I always want to create something accurate and stable in contrast - so it remains a noise.",
