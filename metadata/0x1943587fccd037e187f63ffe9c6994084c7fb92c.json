    "description": "In 2018, I minted my genesis piece titled Quine #1 (This Is Not a Photograph) to explore the relationship between impossible self-reference and the struggle of singular artistic commitment. \n\nThru the Eyes of the Machine (MACHINEVISION) is a series of artworks uprooting and reimagining my past artistic commitments from the perspective of deep learning models by modifying the original descriptions and tags to be used as prompts.\n\nThis is the first of a triptych exploring my genesis piece in particular. \n\nOriginal description: \n\n\"Digital composition made with found media. A quine takes no input and produces only a copy of itself as output. This is an impossible image of a photograph of the camera that took it: a reflection of the impossibilities and internal inconsistencies artists face when projecting their ideas to a single representation. \"",
