    "description": "OBSTACLES is a digital generative artwork and a result of an isometric study. OBSTACLES consists of an underlying isometric grid along with a placement system to place objects at certain coordinates. These objects are in this work several obstacles with different height, length and depth. They are placed side by side in diagonal lines throughout the artwork, from top to bottom.\n\nOBSTACLES has an expression of controlled chaos. The frame around the piece can be seen as the fence around a playground where chaos is allowed. To balance the chaotic mess, a soothing palette was chosen.\n\nThe first owner/buyer has the option to receive a limited edition, artist-signed, archival-quality print 1/1 physical print.\n\nDigital: PNG 12000×18000\nPhysical: 38×57cm",
