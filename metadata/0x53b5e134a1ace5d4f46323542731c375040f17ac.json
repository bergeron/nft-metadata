    "description": "This artpiece is part of his quintessential series, Diligent Attitude Towards a Meaningless Thing. Wan Lee drew a meaningless line with a pencil on the paper, and greatly enlarged it and moved it to the canvas. And he employs contract workers to fill the lines with paint. The painting, ordered by the artist as an employer and a consumer, fails be meaningful to the workers and meaningless for the artist as well. Only traces of diligent efforts to fulfil a contract remain, instead. Through the series, Lee warns that if people continue to be sincere about meaningless things, in the future, an impersonal era in which everyone is domesticated in the labour and consumption structures presented by the social system may come.",
