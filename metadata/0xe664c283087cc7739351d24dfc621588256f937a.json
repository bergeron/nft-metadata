    "description": "\"Count Bands\" is a complete ego trip moment in my album.  It is filled with very honest and emotional expressions. I made this record for a mental high, but also for a unique reminder that the ego is always the death of a man.  This is a recurring theme my album touches upon that will explored on a deeper level with each release. I felt that “Count Bands” was a great starting point to kick off the sonically emotional rollercoaster that is my debut album. So what better place to start then at the very top of that roller coaster.\n\nThe team and I flew out to Sun Valley, Idaho and locked our selves in a cabin to build out the framework of the album. By day 4 \"Count Bands\" happened to be a product of that trip. It's aggressive and infectious energy was something that has resonated with me since.  ",
