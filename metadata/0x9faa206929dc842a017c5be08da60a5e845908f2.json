    "description": "Photo: 8 000 х 5 323 px\n\nI've been walking alone for so long I'm used to it.\nOnly the rustle of leaves underneath my feet. \nI am misguided, misunderstood, cold - \nLike a soft clay leaking from a broken mold. \n\nI shall be strong enough to wander until the end of time.\nWill another soul be ever by the side of mine? \nIn this deafening silence the night has come \nI’m striving to cry but my heart is numb.\n\nWe sometimes don’t see who has long been lost\nAnd cannot return to the place our paths had crossed.\nLoneliness hovers above like a bird of prey\nTo destroy me when I surrender to the dismay…\n\n(by AlkudNFT)\n\nP.S. This is my first poem in English so please don't judge it strictly :)",
