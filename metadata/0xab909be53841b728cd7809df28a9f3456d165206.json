    "description": "Edward Chancellor is a financial historian, journalist, and author of, \"Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation\" and his latest, “The Price of Time: The Real Story of Interest”\n\nThe two books link together the history of money and finance, and human culture.\n\nIn today’s episode, we explore the ways in which money and finance are embedded deeper in our lives than we may have previously thought.\n\nArt generated from the quote at [51:00 -] “Time is money. Once you realize that time has value, then it should start becoming, immediately clear, that taking interest rates—the price of time down to zero is highly unnatural. It would be like depriving an animal of oxygen. And taking them to negative becomes almost insane.” [51:27]\n\n10% of proceeds go to Bankless DAO. \n\nAs a reminder, this Monday Mint episode marks the end of Phase I of Bankless Collectibles. This is the last Monday Mint episode in 2023.",
