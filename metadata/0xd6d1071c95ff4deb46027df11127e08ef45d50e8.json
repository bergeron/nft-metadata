    "description": "The Thunderhogs are a notorious gang of battle-hardened warriors who roam the wasteland in their loud and imposing battle vehicles. Their vehicles are massive, with huge motors that allow them to plow through obstacles and crush anything in their path. The Thunderhogs are known for their love of destruction and chaos, and they revel in the roar of their engines as they tear through the landscape. They are feared and respected by all who encounter them, and they will stop at nothing to emerge victorious in any battle they engage in.",
