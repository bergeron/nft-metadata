    "description": "3 days of war. The siren has become part of the inside voice. A drone was shot down over my house yesterday. My man and father took up weapons and became on the defensive! Friends were making molotov cocktails. We're all just like One! People stop tanks with their naked hands! We can't be afraid! I am so proud of my people!!!\nThis is my home, my land. My two small children sleeping on the boards in a cellar in freezing. I listen to the bangs outside.\nI am not leaving my country! But I am must leaving town!\nMore than 12 hours without safety shelter, you don't know if you're lucky or not?\nSirens blaring. I see two shells flying at the town. But it's not scary me any more... my brain has fully accepted this reality.\n...\nToday we are live! We scare at every noise! I want to help my Country! WE DON'T WANT WAR! Our children want to sleep in peace in their beds! This art is about the pain we are all filling. All money from the sale will go to help the soldiers, we really need your support!",
