    "description": "The Chestplate of Regeneration is one of three Artifacts for Slaying Moloch, a narrative experiment in fashion, coordination, and time. Moloch is the [god of coordination failure](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) and this project seeks to find new methods to defeat him through shared rituals. Each Artifact for Slaying Moloch exists as a trinity of linked forms: 1) a physical garment, 2) an NFT permanently stored on Arweave, and 3) a collective witness provenance ledger appendable via an AR portal triggered from a scan of the physical garments during community events.
