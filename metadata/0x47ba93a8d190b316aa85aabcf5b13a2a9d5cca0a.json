    "description": "‘Species of means’ is a photographic series that explores daily life in gentrified urban spaces. The photographs travel through post-colonial architecture and buildings of geo-cultural influences.\n\nScenes in the series are generated in the computer environment, characterising conspicuous elements that are prioritised in neoclassical and hybrid-designed colonial architectures (wooden jalousie windows, distinctive colour schemes, textures, cultural motifs etc.) together with random and obsolete items from retrofitted buildings. \n\nThe photographs are entirely experimental, amplifying untested ideas and aptitude with a virtual medium. The subtlety in wall textures, anaemic colour schemes and sharp-edged models aggregate a sequence of technical and playful thought processes from production right through spectatorship.",
