    "description": "Smoked Something is a chance to take a deep breath in and relax, unwind and zone out. An instrumental head-nod jazz vibe cooked up in the middle of the night imagining Dilla, George Duke and Herbie sharing a bowl...\n\nperformed, programmed, produced by MdCL\n\nIt's always special to share the music with you, and this time there's a little more to this drop - it's the first of 8 drops (!) for [$BUYBACK Emerald] with Mashibeats - the web3 music-creator community I founded. We're taking this opportunity to invite you as a music NFT collector, to be part of our community.\n\nThere's two goals in mind for [$BUYBACK Emerald]. \n\nGOAL 1: increase governance membership of Mashibeats \n- every collector of this NFT can claim an airdrop of 35 $BUYBACK, representing governance in Mashibeats\n\nGOAL 2: building the community treasury which $BUYBACK holders have voting power over\n- 70% of funds from this drop go directly to the Mashibeats treasury. Over the 8 drops we aim to raise up to 5 ETH, to then have community join in making proposals for $BUYBACK holders to vote on. \n\nHolders also curate and A&R by way of voting - our recently released remix contest winners vinyl and NFTs having been all decided by $BUYBACK members - curation by community ❤️ \n\nAfter collecting (thank you! and welcome!), head over to http://mashibeats.xyz/buyback\n\nHeadsup - each subsequent drop in this series of 8 will be a smaller edition batch, with a +0.01 increase in price and an increase in $BUYBACK claimable. And we're working on something special for collectors who collect all 8 of the drops !\n\nshout out to the fam @RedbudNFT - you know you gotta Smoke Something x",
