    "description": "“With What We Have” is a series of 3 paintings by Amber Vittoria for her inaugural Coinbase NFT drop. Each in an edition of 30, these paintings speak to both the life we have lived and the life we have yet to live.\n\nThe final piece, “With What We Have Seen,” inspires us to be thankful for our past, in all of its tribulations and triumphs, as these moments brought us to this very moment.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artist Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.",
