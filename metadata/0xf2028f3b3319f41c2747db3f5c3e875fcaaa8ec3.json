    "description": "My old friend. \nI have seen this tree (Bergahorn - Sycamore) almost daily for the last 10 years on my walks with my dog and over time it has become my favorite tree. \nWhenever i bring my camera to this walks there's hardly a day i don't take a picture of it, and my 4-5 favorite angles to look at it are always checked.  \n \nIt has seen me walk by with friends and family, has seen my dog grow from puppy to happy senior and is now doing the same with my young daughter  \n\nIt has a connection with me and it draws my view everytime i pass it.\n\nI want to share my old friend with you guys and make it an accessible piece that is dear to me  \nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use for private display and in groups including virtual galleries.
