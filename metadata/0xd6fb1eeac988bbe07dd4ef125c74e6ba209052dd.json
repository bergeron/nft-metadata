    "description": "A fairy tale of a different kindâ€¦\nA mystical monarch sits smothered in its twitching wings\nit exists beyond one's visions and dreams\nBoth tender and inert, the stepmother of all orphaned mice that populate the dark corners of the abandoned kingdom\nMuch like a serene and beautiful feline, flaunting sorrowful eyes, its kindness is rooted through its whole, toy-like, being as if its were merely a softly-sighing ornament aching instead to be a steadfast tree.\nBeyond her sharp pointed teeth lies its true nurturing nature and when unsheathed, its claws are hard and quick to cut.  All but guaranteed to scare everyone with their painful utility.\nits favored courtiers look on and squeak high-pitched adorations upward at the fetchingly fragmented 'mother' of all of their twitching kind.\nIn its decapitated majesty, its nourishes all.",
