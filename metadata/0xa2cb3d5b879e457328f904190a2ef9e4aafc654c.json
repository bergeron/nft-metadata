    "description": "(The Hunted) This piece is inspired by circus knife throwing shows and how women were always the target.\n\nThis is an expression of what it feels like to be preyed upon.\n\nThe spanish word cazada is phonetically identical to casada (marriage). After reading a novella depicting extreme violence between of a newly wed couple, Botticelli began to gift newly weds paintings of women being hunted. This was a reminder to new wives to remain submissive in their new titles.",
