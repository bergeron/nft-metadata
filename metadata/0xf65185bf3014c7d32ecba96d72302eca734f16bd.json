    "description": "A moment of solitude on the Senja island in northern Norway. When the winter brings cold winds and long nights, it also brings some of the most beautiful sceneries you can witness.\n\nBeing in the right place at the right moment as a landscape photographer is one of the hardest things to do, yet when things align, you are gifted with a view you can hardly believe. \n\nThis photograph is one of those moments where everything aligned: no wind and beautifully clear water with a hint of aurora on the horizon and a star-filled sky.",
