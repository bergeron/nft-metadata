    "description": "Yo, great bounty hunter! The year is 2221. The cyber-prison orbiting Mars was attacked and the demons imprisoned there have escaped! Your job is to find those bastards, dead or dead. You can collect their heads as trophies or brag to your friends about buying a jpeg. Contracts to catch new demons will appear periodically as we progress. If you catch 3 demons, you'll be rewarded with an avatar of yourself in demon style. Yeah, we'll clone you and give you killer cyber implants. So you can put your enhanced head in your avatar. Totally insane cyber future, I agree. Good hunting, and remember; all demons MUST be caught!",
