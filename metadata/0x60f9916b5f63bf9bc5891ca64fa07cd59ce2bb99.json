    "description": "IF YOU MINT THIS, YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET A FREE MINT OF OUR NEXT RELEASE (FROM THE PM ALBUM) IN 2 WEEKS.\n\nWho are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n\nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n“Drive (All Day All Night)” is the 8th of these 24 songs. We made this on a Tik Tok live stream 2 weeks ago and it hit our feels so hard that we decided it needed to be the next release. It’s about a long-distance relationship when you have a hard time connecting and staying in sync with each other. Would you drive all day and all night to see this person? You’re damn right you would!",
