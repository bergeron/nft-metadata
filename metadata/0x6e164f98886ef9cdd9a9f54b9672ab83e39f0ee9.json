    "description": "Violette Cici is a French/Australian digital collage artist. I found her on Twitter and was drawn to her collage style.\n\n\"I believe that each species has its own perspective which creates a unique reality. The more we can open ourselves to the idea that other realities different than our own exist, the faster we can accept new ideas and viewpoints â€“ and the richer our lives will be. This is an important part of my art.\"\n\nThis piece, Fun in Space, reminds me of my love for sci-fi, where the laws of physics, space, and time are not limited.\n\nWhat do you see?",
