    "description": "- Monthly airdrops for holders;  \n- Exclusive raffles for holders;  \n- Access to members chat on discord;  \n- And whatever crazy idea I may come up with.\n\n\"What'll it be tonight?\" the barkeep asks. You ponder a bit and answer. \"Martini, but make it TRA$HY!\"\n\nHe looks at you in disgust but begrudgingly reaches under the counter top, slowly pulling out beneath him a broken Martini Glass which is covered in bacteria and unknown substances. The barkeep puts on protective gear and starts sawing open old batteries, vials of estrogen and glow sticks, adding each in turn to the bubbling concoction. After what feels like hours he transfers the mixture into a cocktail shaker along with a double shot of gasoline. \n\n\"Meticulously shaken with LSD laced ice and garnished with a Cyanide infused olive\",\n\nHe shouts, muted under his 3M Respirator. After being handed your drink, you take a long look at the glass. The fumes dancing off its surface blur your vision, spinning your surroundings into swirls of hallucination. As the drink begins magically floating into your hand, your mouth begins to dry and you feel extremely parched. \n\nYou take one last look at the bartender and take a large swig of the drink, killing you instantly.",
