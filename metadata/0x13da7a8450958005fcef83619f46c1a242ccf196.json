    "description": "Hong Kong Stillness - diptych #8\n2250 x 2250 px\nPhase One P30+\n\nHow does a densely populated city like Hong Kong creates a livable context for the inhabitants? If stillness can be found in there, what might we in the West learn from such a metropolis about how to cope with massive transitions? \n\nIn 2015 I created a small series of diptych photographs depicting people and structures in Hong Kong in various states of stillness, capturing the quieter moments of transition in the daily life of the city’s inhabitants. I noticed that people seemed to accept the transitions in their frenetic urban lives in an almost poetic way. Employing soft colors and drawing on the city’s pattern of ever-present lines, I translated this observation into stylized images that evoke an atmosphere of air and light in which silence reigns. What remains when the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong dies down, when the city transitions from a state of intense activity to a state of stillness, is silence.  \n",
