    "description": "This work aims to a conversion of traditional portraits.\n\nThe pictorial expression of the person gives way to a form between the real and the digital. They are avatars of representation that modify the shapes and features of the individual, adapting to a new space and a new survival. If before the attempt was made to remove the psyche from the model, now that psyche is masked. We live and offer ourselves in this masquerade ball.\n\nPhotography JPG \n5884 x 7535 px \n96 ppp\n24 bit\n",
