    "description": "... The human being\n\nWood and other materials offer different possibilities to describe the human being in its particularity.\n\nThrough form and material, vulnerability but also hardness and coldness can be expressed. As an artist, I have taken up this theme and depicted different characters and their traits in these materials.\n\nAll images in this collection are 2560 x 3840 resolution.\n\nOriginal art by man2art.\n\nCreated with :\nChainsaw - Canon EOS - Illustrator - Photoshop\n\n",
