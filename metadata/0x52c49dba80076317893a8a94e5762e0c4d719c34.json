    "description": "Reinterpretations of Hollywood Dreams, glamour and mid-21st century robot ideations half a century from when the artist first pondered them.\n\nWhat was once the purview of male Hollywood, is now within the realm of female ownership - - with the robot center stage as the 'other' in the relationship. Beauty, same.\n\nHer Grandmother knew this, and prepared her for the beauty of mechanics.\n\nThis is her Grandmother's Robot.",
