My daughter took a picture and I loved these graceful and fast seagulls so much.\n\nLooking at them, you can't even imagine how many wonders, beautiful sea animals, islands, ships and beautiful places they have seen in their lifetime.\n\nAnd where their last harbor was before they came to our island.\n\nAnd how beautiful they are in flight!",
