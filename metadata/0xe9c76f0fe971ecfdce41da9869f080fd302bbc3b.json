    "description": "The warm glow of the sunset spilled across the iconic mountain. Clouds gently brushed the peak that loomed above the infamous lake before us. The rowboats snaked their way across the surface of the water, bobbing gently, resting after a day of use. We were alone. \n\nIt was too late in the day for tourists, too early for the evening wildlife. The world was quiet, leaving the wind to orchestrate its symphony amongst the endless trees. Pine needles rustled all around. Small streams of water traced their way down our mountainous cocoon and into the lake, adding further flavor to nature's melody.\n\nI breathed in deeply, savoring every second. The sweet aromas of nature filled my lungs, the soft sounds of the evening filled my ears, and the golden sunlight swept over my reality, lulling me into one of the most perfect moments of peace I have ever known. Even now my words fail me as I attempt to ascribe the scene its due glory.\n\nWe stayed a while longer, insulated from the outside world.",
