    "description": "Homeless kids, with no stability, On the streets, violence and exploitation brutally, Adults with no scruples, no morality, \"The Mental Gang\" is their only lifeline, you see.\n\nFighting to survive, lack of resources, Competition is fierce, no truce or pauses, Searching in trash, begging and stealing, How far can they go, with no fear of dying?\n\nIn the city, similar groups, Police lurking, always on alert, Life on the streets, no mercy or love, The future uncertain, but they must move.\n\nLife on the streets, tough and cruel, But unity brings strength, that's the rule, \"The Mental Gang\", brotherhood supreme, Mutual protection, sharing what they dream.\n\nOn the streets, life is rough, But hope still lives, it's enough, \"The Mental Gang\", fighting for their future, Always moving forward, no looking back, they nurture.\n\n\"El que tenga miedo a morir, que no nazca\"",
