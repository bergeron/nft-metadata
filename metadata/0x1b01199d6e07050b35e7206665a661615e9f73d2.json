    "description": "Inspired by Rik Oostenbroek and his »SELF« competition, the timing couldn't have been worse for me with this piece. Being completely stressed out already, with hurting wrists and a back, that was killing me like never before, this artwork was the one thing I actually really wanted to do during that time. Although I originally thought, that I need to work on this a little bit more, it somehow now perfectly captures the state of me and my body during that time. Needless to say, I feel way better now!\n\nSince I liked Rik's approach to make this available to the public, inviting the community to play and work with his original art, I decided to make this my first open edition to spread his vision of »SELF« even further.\n\n100% drawn freehand on my iPad Pro. No rulers used. Final details added in Photoshop. 5000 x 5000 px.",
