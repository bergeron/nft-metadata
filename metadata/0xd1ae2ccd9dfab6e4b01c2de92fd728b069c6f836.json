    "description": "36 Views of Death, mixed media study of Frank Mechau's \"Death by Water,\" digitally painted onto an original photograph of a folded up canvas. Mechau, the artist's great-grandfather, was a prolific American painter; three time Guggenheim Fellow, Dean of Columbia's Painting and Sculpture Dept, featured in institutions across America including The Metropolitan Museum of Art. This study explores the inspiration of the original painting: the death of a friend by plane crash during World War II. The title, 36 Views of Death, pays homage to Hokusai, a clear influence on Mechau's work which sought to marry classical eastern and western aesthetics in an exploration of the natural world. \n\nThe Inverse Collection examines existential questions presented by simulated realities, absolute information, an overabundance of choice, and a great and widespread suffering caused by disconnectedness.
