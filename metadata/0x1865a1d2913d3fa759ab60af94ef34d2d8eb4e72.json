    "description": "Sara \n\nSince the day I saw her in the ultrasound scan , I fell in love with her. One thing I realized pretty quickly was that she has a free and strong will . She has always done what she wanted and when she wanted, like we couldn’t get a clear 3d ultrasound for her as she would always cover her face whenever we tried to get one, she even came almost a month in advance of her predicted due date. She started sitting before she could roll , I don't know how, but she loves listening to rap music and also loves old Hindi classic songs and also the odd baby shark do do do . She has her own weird playlist it seems.\n\nSo, I have stopped giving too much attention on ‘parenting handbook’ on what and when a child should be doing something . I just love watching her grow and do whatever she wants :) \n\nI will always be there for her, guiding her , picking her up when she falls , supporting her in every way I can, but will let her choose her own path and win her own life. This is to celebrate the fearlessness, free will and innocence of human life , with that I present to you my first collection… Sara , choosing her own path.\n\nIn this picture, we went to Acadia National Park to witness the magic of fall colors. We went on a hike somewhere in the park and Sara decided to go ahead on her own, I saw her walking on the side of the regular paved trail as if she decided that this is the Path that she will be walking on . I grabbed my camera and I had a vintage Pentax lens on it at that time, I focused and framed the shot and Sara moved on. The vintage lens gave it a dreamy and rustic vibe.",
