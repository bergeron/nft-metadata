    "description": "The Childhood collection is inspired by the ancient Chinese Zodiac but with a twist. Qu Zijun believes that the cat, not a member of the original Zodiac, is a worthy addition to the ensemble as millions of people around the world adore their feline friends. We all have fond childhood memories of animals. Do you remember your favorite animal when you were five? This collection was created to help us indulge in an enjoyable recollection of our childhood through hand-drawn aesthetics, vibrant colors and our favorite animals from around the world.",
