    "description": "If these last few years have thought us anything, it is to treasure the freedoms we had taken for granted when they were abundant. Freedom of movement, freedom to critique, freedom to choose your path, even freedom of thought. These rights and liberties are being lost on a daily basis due to forces of change seemingly outside of our control: new laws being implemented, not owning our data, and the borders of exploration being blocked by policies in the name of safety. What is freedom? What does it mean to live in a free society? These questions have inspired passionate debate across the globe for a very long time. While the ways in which we understand freedom may differ, at its core are universal questions about how we understand ourselves and how we relate to each other. For some, it comes down to the relationship between authority and its subjects. For others, freedom begins with the ability to live with dignity. How do you feel about it and what do you think? Are you free?",
