    "description": "I know this road like the back of my hand. I could travel it with my eyes closed.\nI know its meanderings and its faults, and how its wind blows.\n\nI know this road and its dreamy trees, where the birds sing songs of doubts. Will it get better? Will you be able to breathe?\n\nI know this road and all its stones. A pathway to a place where nothing is as it seems. Will I get there? Or is it beyond my dreams?\n\nBut, I know this road, its color, and its breeze, its unending windings that force and displace——that pushes you to a new path where new  learning begins.\n\n\nPixel Width 4000px\nPixel Height 5000px\nPhysical Width 339mm\nPhysical Height 423mm\nDPI 300\nDate finished 1/5/2022",
