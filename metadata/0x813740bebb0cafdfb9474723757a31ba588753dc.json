    "description": "!!!! 1st song of the Tarotsings February NFT Marathon !!!! \n\nThe music I am sharing with you for the next 28 days is a reflection of the most vulnerable part of who I am as a human being. Think of it as a diary written of songs essentially. There is no overthinking or strategy involved in the making of this music, just pure creative flow - exposing the most raw side of me as an artist.\n\n\"Paper & Pencils\" is lowkey a metaphor for all the creative ideas that flow through me & the process of turning all my manifestations into reality by just taking the leap & following my gut. I've really began to learn that believing in yourself is the key, and any locked door is just merely an illusion <3 \n\nHighest bidder get's the first spot in the Tarotsings Astral Realm! \n\nLyrics:\n\nIt flows  \nAnd it goes \nComposing  \nLike a puzzle with no picture \n\nIt grows on you slow  \nFairly quickly \nTil it turns to something you just used to know \n\nPatience  \nI tread  \nI’m running in my head \nGoin slow through the tunnel vision  \nIn a maze of a last minute decision  \nPaper & pencils in my bed \n\nSketch it off of memory \nJust before they pass  \nThey don’t last \nAnyway \n\nEvery inch of space \nPut way too much weight \nOn what you’re gonna say \nI don’t wanna wait \nImma find some type of way \n\nIt grows on you slow  \nFairly quickly \nTil it turns to something you just used to know  \n\nPatience  \nI tread  \nI’m running in my head \nGoin slow through the tunnel vision  \nIn a maze of a last minute decision  \nPaper & pencils in my bed \n\nSketch it off of memory \nJust before they pass  \nThey don’t last \nAnyway",
