    "description": "Animated sequence of 16 hand-drawn versions of the P letterform made out of the simplest geometric forms, because letter P is the 16th letter in the Latin alphabet. Also, as number 16 fits in a four quarters size in music, a simple unique 120bpm tempo looped track was created for this piece of typographic art. \nMade in collaboration with 36daysoftype project.",
