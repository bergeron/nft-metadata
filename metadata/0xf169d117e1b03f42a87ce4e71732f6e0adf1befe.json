    "description": "The Jolly Elves have courageously volunteered to complete a perilous mission for their benefactor Santa. 6000 Elves were handpicked to venture into the digital metaverse to discover new methods and techniques to get gifts to everyone throughout the year. This mission was titled, Operation Jolly. The Metaverse is vast, and the Elves have gotten themselves stuck throughout the various ecosystems. Some of which have changed them irrevocably.. As they look for a way to report back to Santa's Workshop, who knows what they will find.",
