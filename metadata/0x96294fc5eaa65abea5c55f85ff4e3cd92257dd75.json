    "description": "Glacier Bay on the last day of August\n\nThis glacier sits at the end of a straight, like a roadblock that cannot be pushed aside. Significant and crisp cold that day, listening to the ice shift and crack, but so peaceful and surreal. So many birds and sea lions, bringing life to the surroundings. \n\nAn incredible adventure outdoors in Alaska.\n",
