    "description": "What makes this unique is each abstract painting is made using portions of paintings from old masters such as Caravaggio, Raphael, Monet, Van Gogh, Botticelli, Titian, Renoir etc.. Swirls, shapes and strokes are made by my hand, but they are superimposed with snippets and pieces of famous paintings. Some of it obvious, some of it much more subtle, obscure and hidden.\nI am always looking to innovate and create art in new ways. I was thinking about how to put human form into an abstract piece without it becoming something else other than abstract. My answer was to use multiple and various forms, as well as other textures from previously painted public domain masters and use that as the “paint”, and to fashion it into something completely new.",
