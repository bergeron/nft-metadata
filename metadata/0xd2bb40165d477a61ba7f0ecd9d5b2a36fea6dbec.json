    "description": "my favorite watercolor is in front of you.\nthis picture was painted by me on the verge of strong and difficult experiences. it's about the fact that there always comes a moment when you smile again, when you've dealt with everything. and again you make sure that you can trust yourself. emotions are an element, and it is not always possible to control them. but you can plunge into yourself and understand that it gives you strength and happiness. \nand I want to give faith in the best, no matter how strong the covering wave seems\nand each of us is a part of nature, so we associate ourselves with it and it is so close. therefore, people like to look at water and fire, they pacify, carry away deep feelings. be for yourself a wave that does not kill, but revives, believe yourself and you will be able to do everything",
