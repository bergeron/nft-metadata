    "description": "EMERGENCE 001\n\nEmergence is a feeling of warm liquid, hugging the contours of a face. A darkened backdrop intertwines with colorful, saturated, bright, and wet highlights. Micro details give the viewer the sense of movement and motion. Slowly pushing through the flat surface of fluid, a face emerges. Emergence is the creation of life.\n\n2000 x 2000 pixels\n\nCreated by Bryan Coleman December 2021\n\nBryan Coleman is an American digital artist with a degree in time based media.
