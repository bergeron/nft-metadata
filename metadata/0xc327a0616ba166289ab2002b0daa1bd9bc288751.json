    "description": "Kumbh Mela is one of India's most important religious festivals and the largest gathering on Earth. The festival happens once every 12 years in the place called Sangam in Allahabad city where the Holy Ganga and Holy Yamuna rivers confluence. It is a meeting point for millions of pilgrims and thousands of Naga Sadhus.\n\nThese sacred Naga Sadhus lead an ascetic life on the hillside of the Himalayas away from the public eye and society and are detached totally from this world. They do not wear clothes and cover their bodies with ashes. Kumbh Mela is one of the rare occasions when they come out in public.\n\nThe purpose of this congregation lasting almost 2 mounts is to take the holy bath in Sangam and purify from sins.  \nWhen the time comes for the holy bath, Naga Sadhus rush to the Sangam like a lover trying to meet his beloved. It is the time for purification and redemption from their past sins. It is possible to read the feelings of pride and gratitude on their faces.",
