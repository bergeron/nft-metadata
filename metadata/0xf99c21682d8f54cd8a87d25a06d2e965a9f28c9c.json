He kept wandering around public places like flyovers, stairs, distribution boxes and slopes etc, writing with brushes and black paint, telling his family history and declaring his “sovereignty” over Kowloon.\nAuthorized by Tsang’s family and Lau Kin-wai (劉健威), a Hong Kong art critic and Tsang’s close friend who owns the copyright of his “calligraphy”, Lau has invited Sunny Lee (李振民) to design a series of digital artwork and NFT based on Tsang’s writing style and authentic artwork, so that Tsang’s work can be seen in a contemporary way in the virtual world and saved with blockchain technology forever.\n",
