    "description": "When she wakes up, she turns on her favorite music, brews herself a cup of strong coffee and pours milk in a saucer for her black cat.\nShe is stubborn, proud, independent, determined, confident, energetic, attractive, original, stylish... a bitch.\nShe is hated, feared, adored. She is worshipped, admired, always noticed.\nShe is the storm, the typhoon, the earthquake, the weightlessness, the magnetic storms. She is a new current, a new road, a new wave, and a new force called feminism.\n\nSize 5000x6125",
