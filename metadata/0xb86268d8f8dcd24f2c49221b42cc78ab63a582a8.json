    "description": "This composite piece was created in northern Norway in 2 different locations after many sleepless nights & days of driving around to find the perfect foreground. I had been wanting to visit Norway for years to go sea kayaking in fjords, but I ended up being blessed with perfect conditions to shoot northern lights for a few days, so I was able to capture spectacular auroras. \n\nWhen I shot the sky, I ended up sleeping in the rental car as I did not want to miss any opportunities to capture the incredible show I saw that night. The sky suddenly became very bright and an explosion of colours started dancing very fast above me. I had seen northern lights back home in Banff before, but never this intense. My entire body was aching after a few sleepless nights and car camping, but the photos I shot made it so worth it. I captured the foreground in Senja a week later at a spectacular location with jagged mountains that reminded me of Patagonia. This piece is probably my favourite to date for its beauty, but also for the amount of effort it took me to create it.\n\nCollector can chose to receive a digitally signed fine art print.",
