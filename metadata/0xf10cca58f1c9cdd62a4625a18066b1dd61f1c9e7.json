    "description": "ðŸ”Š Sound on, please\n\nThis is from what the collection begins. Classic yellow inflatable duck.\n\nFor me, yellow rubber duck â€” it's a symbol of happy childhood in evening bath with bubbles.\n\nThis duck is carefully sewn and inflated by me in virtual space, but it gives the same warm emotions.",
