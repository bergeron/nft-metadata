    "description": "The Tang Dynasty had paper but mostly used bamboo slips.\n\n\n\nPicking up a roll of bamboo slips, Li Zheng saw a problem: \"Today some people buy things together, each pay eight money, surplus three money; Each out seven money, less than four money, ask the number of people, prices each geometry.\n\n\n\nThe Tang dynasty already had this kind of math problem? And the way to do that is to assume units, which you can do if you know what the unknowns are.\n\n\n\nIf you don't know how to set the unknowns, it will be very complicated, as long as you set the unknowns, it will be much easier to calculate.\n\n\n\nIn any case, On his last day on the job, Li Zheng didn't have to worry so much.\n\n\n\nWrite the answer on the bamboo slip after typing the draft with a brush. Fifty-three yuan for seven people.\n\n\n\nThen I picked up another one that was about the war.",
