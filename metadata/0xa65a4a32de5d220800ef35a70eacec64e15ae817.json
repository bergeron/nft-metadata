    "name": "38 Special Revolver (Silver) + Red Dot",
    "description": "A very non-traditional take on a classic style revolver. \r\n\r\nThe .38 Special is one of the most popular revolver cartridges used today. They are most commonly used in short barrelled or 'snub nose' revolvers such as the Ruger LCR and the S&W J-Frame. These compact revolvers are ideal for conceal carry and self defense purposes, but versatile enough to be used for war, police work, competitive shooting, and SOS signals. The .38 Special is renowned for being a dependable round for anyone who chooses to shoot. ",
