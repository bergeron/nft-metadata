    "description": "Artist: Lauren Thompson\n\nIn 2021 I was stormborn, and since then my lens has become a love letter to severe weather. April 21, 2022 in Rozel, Kansas is a day I will never forget. As I watched this breathtaking, slow-moving supercell dance across the horizon, I felt an elation and raw sense of freedom in my soul like never before. The weary pieces of my heart came alive as the glorious sunset painted the retreating storm in a fiery afterglow and crawling lightning bolts reached for the heavens. The pursuit of this fleeting moment was worth every bit of hardship and sacrifice. All for the chance to feel completely untamed underneath earth's wild atmosphere.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT as long as creator is credited.
