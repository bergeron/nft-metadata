    "description": "If there is a common theme across my 20 year career in art, it’s the obsession with sensual forms, and what is more sensual than a women’s body. The subtle turn of a leg, the gentle curve of her breast. I could go on! \n\nBut more than this it is the quest to understand and challenge our perceptions of beauty. To that end in close to 100 collected works I have explored themes and styles ranging from pixel art to hyper realistic 3D renders. \n\nWith PRIMITEVES (Primitive Eves) I hope to offer a fresh take on erotic art, deconstructing shapes to their most primitive form much like an artists mannequin, and at the same time it is a homage to the culture of the ‘selfie’. Impossibly beautiful standards of beauty shared by anonymous girls posting a never ending stream of images that burn into our screens and hearts. ",
