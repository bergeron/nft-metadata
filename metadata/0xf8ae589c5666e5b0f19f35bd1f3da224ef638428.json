    "description": "Everything here in the old way. \nNothing has changed\nTram tracks, as always, break the rhythm\nStarving people are plopping along Nevsky Prospekt searching for happiness. \nI'm playing the role in my personal theater.\nAll tickets are sold out, the hall is crowded.\nI have nothing to hide. I really don't care what I look like. I am far from the first on this stage.\n\nOld St. Petersburg knows how it should be.\n\nEverything that was in St. Petersburg will remain here forever.",
