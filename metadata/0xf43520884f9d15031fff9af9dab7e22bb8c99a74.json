    "description": "This set of four NFTs serve as VIP access passes for special seating at the May 16, 2022 immersive drive-in movie and Herbal Notes dinner at StudioLOGIK.\n\nThe NFTs are a snippet of a song titled “Make Me Feel” produced by longtime LOGIK collaborator Renzell.wav displaying an animated background image of an outdoor drive-in movie theatre. The looped black-and-white animation playing on the movie screen is a short clip from unreleased The Adventures of Blackman “Episode 1: Rebirth”, and each looped animation is unique to each of the four NFTs.\n\nThe four holders of this NFT will have access to one of four toy car beds for seating during the cannabis-enhanced dinner and movie viewing.\n\nIn addition to being an artwork as part of LOGIK’s oeuvre and its special utility during the event, this NFT also serves as a memento of the evening that four holders will treasure in their permanent collections.",
