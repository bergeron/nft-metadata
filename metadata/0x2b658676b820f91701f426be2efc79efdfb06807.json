    "description": "“criptodancer” is my first NFT collection. Each work is a 1/1 and all are variations of a fictional character “A6O50”. \n\n\n\"CRIPTODANCER\" shows a dystopian scenario in which nature has been digitized and the physical body is trapped in the interface between the virtual and the real. A6O50 is a cyborg that embodies a Latin American dancer caught in the nostalgia of those hot dances among the ruin.\n\nThe costume has been made by electronic junk. \n\n\nAs a dancer and choreographer, I’m interested on explore ways to create performance in the NFT space. Also, I want to investigated the dialog between the body and the digital art scenario.\n\nCreated By @criptodancer\n2023\n\nmusic @camilaesmok IG \nperformance @criptodancer \ngeneral assistant @carlax100pre IG \n",
