    "description": "Lonely horse\n\nGuraymak district of Bitlis.\nBudakli thermal springs in Bitlis are frequented by horses swimming in hot water in winter.\nThe images that appear at minus degrees in winter are much more than thatâ€¦\nEspecially in snowy periods, the water temperature in the open-top spa reaches minus 40-50 degrees. With the meeting of cold water and hot water, a wonderful fog view is formed.\n\nArtist: Mine Evren Ertugrul\nEdition: 1/1\nDate: 30.01.2014\nFile: jpeg 300 dpi\nLocation: Bitlis / Turkey\nImage Size: 3673x2448\n\n\n\n\n",
