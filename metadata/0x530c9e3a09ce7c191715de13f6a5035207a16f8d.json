    "description": "The apple, which started as a transparent circle on a white canvas, improvises with the excitement of “make-up” rather than “drawing”. An apple is a circle. A circle that doesn't say anything becomes a container for various words. The infinite transformation of an apple becomes a process of “self-healing” and a magical experience that decorates, soothes, and takes care of fatigue. \n\n#NFTart  #apple  #physical-based",
