    "description": "To All living,\n\nBeingsThere is no path to happiness; Happiness is the path. So, don't worry. Be happy. I have chosen to be happy because it's good for my health. It's a journey, not a destination. Remember, no medicine cures what happiness can't. It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. Do not dwell in the past, do not worry about the future. Happiness is a state of mind. Be happy and wish happiness for others. Happiness comes from your own actions.\n\nI Love You,\n\nThony ",
