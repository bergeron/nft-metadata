    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n\nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n\"Elevator\" is the 7th wonder of the Beachcrimes world. This tech-house banger has PM written all over it. Believe it or not, this baby was born in a hotel elevator perched on the stunning cliffs of the Amalfi Coast. As we ascended from sea level to the hotel lobby - a cool 1000 feet high - we were beatboxing and humming \"Elevator, straight to the top\" into our voice memos. A few hours later, it was a fully-fledged song. How's that for an elevator pitch?",
