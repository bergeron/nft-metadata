    "description": "This photograph was taken during a breathtaking sunset at a fishing village near Vizhinjam, Kerala.\nVizhinjam used to be a peaceful fishing village.But the fishermen and their lives are being threatened by the construction of a new port.\nAfter talking with a few people,they unanimously agreed  that the fish population has significantly declined.\n'After the port has completed,the pollution,noise and sea traffic will drive our fish elsewhere and we would have to sail further into the sea which could have disastrous outcomes.Most of us don't have big boats to do so'.A local fisherman said.\n\nAs I was witnessing the sunset,all I could think about was the plight of the fishermen who depend on the oceanfor their livelihood.\nI wonder what they would say if they could view themselves in the photograph, with their boats engulfed by the orange sun, while being fully aware of the threat to their livelihoods posed by urbanization.",
