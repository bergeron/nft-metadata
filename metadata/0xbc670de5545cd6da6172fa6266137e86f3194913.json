    "description": "What blooms beyond the binary? We do. Critically examining the roles that gender and authority play in shaping human experience, this work is a culmination of the artist's reflections on the ever-evolving and multifaceted nature of identity. Fetish attire accentuates the intricate balance between control and vulnerability, dominance and submission, while floral glitches juxtapose power and fetishism, emphasizing the artist's resistance to binary limitations. The artwork is an opportunity to contemplate the intersections of societal norms and individual expression, encouraging a deeper understanding of the complexities of one's identity. Here we are, beyond the binary, where a diverse and nuanced spectrum of gender expressions flourishes, transcending traditional beliefs.",
