    "description": "Since ancient times, the Japanese have personified the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, which govern the year, to wish for prosperity during the year.\nThis year is the Year of the Rabbit, so I drew a beautiful Japanese bunny girl.\nIn my opinion, I believe that loincloths, the Japanese underwear, evoke a certain excitement.\n\nAs a side note, I came up with the above common belief while drinking whisky earlier in the day.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
