    "description": "With 3 rarity traits under 1% and a blossoming YouTube channel, Dad #28 has a tendency to fall into the limelight. #28 has a healthy future ahead of him if his friends and kid donâ€™t go all-in on $HIT coins first. The #28 Mower is retrofitted with a half-barrel beer keg redesigned to feed Nitrous Oxide to a supercharged engine, complete with a rear spoiler up high to keep it from blowing its top off.",
