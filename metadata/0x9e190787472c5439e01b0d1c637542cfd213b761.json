    "description": "The Writing's on the Wall is the first diptych of photographs from the Layered Reality series. Is this art? Are NFTs art? Is photography art? Is graffiti art? The writing on the wall says it is. Then who are we to argue?\n--\nIn the Layered Reality series I use layers and reflections to compose a new reality, a single exposure collage of the moment, revealing a world that is both real and surreal at the same time.\n\nI transform the city into an poetic dreamscape of shadows and light, colors and lines, shapes and subjects that appear simultaneously in front of and behind my lens.\n\nI use the framework of what is there and then wait for the decisive moment of whatâ€™s to come, or capture painterly still lifes that usually escape the attention of passersby.\n--\nThe collector will receive both high resolution files optimized for print upon request, so he/she can give this work a place in his/her actual world.",
