    "description": "Children often get lost with the magical qualities of things that appear to float that we as adults often take for granted. From capturing the fun of blowing bubbles to dandelion seeds, this series of work aims to capture these fleeting moments of fascination and joy children experience, when they learn to figure out the world around them.  \n \nEach image is named after the music that was playing during the shoot. The song playing for this one was 'Higher Love' by Whitney Houston and Kygo. Chosen by my daughter, who was also the model.  \n \nPhotography and Digital 3D Photoshop and Maya RGB 4724 x 4724",
