    "description": "**‘Ballerina’s IN-Bound’ is An AI iteration that was pulled from the original acrylic painting ‘Storm Dancers’**\n\n`The Iterations: A collection solely based on the curation of reworked and recreated iterations from my exploration into the world that is Lady Ai. While most are unsure of what the world of Ai really consists of, In this case it is my own art, my selective prompt words and her interpretation of my input manipulating shapes and colors that resemble my original piece. Ai tends to magnify these small beauties and lets you explore what I imagine it would be like to be within the piece itself.`\n\n`- Digitally reworked & upsized AI Iteration`\n`- Size & Resolution: 6000 x 6000 x 300ppi`\n`- Format: PNG`",
