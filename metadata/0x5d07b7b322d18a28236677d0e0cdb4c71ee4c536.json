    "description": "The Citadel Of Nightmares just so happens to be one of my first pieces that I've decided to make and publish in this space. When I made this piece I was at my absolute bottom, but what I love about this piece is that it shows once you hit rock bottom you can't go any lower, and that the only direction you can truly go is up. To everyone struggling in life stay strong, it does get better.",
