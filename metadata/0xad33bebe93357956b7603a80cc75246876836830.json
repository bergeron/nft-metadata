    "description": "\nIn Iran, a land of ancient ways,\nThe winds of change now blow and sway.\nFor women there, the veil's demand\nHas long suppressed their right to stand.\nBut now they rise, with voices strong,\nDefying laws that kept them wronged.\nTheir courage shines, a beacon bright,\nFor freedom's cause, they stand and fight.\nYet other battles must be won,\nFor all who seek to live as one.\nFor human rights and justice fair,\nAre hopes that all of us can share.\nMay we support and stand beside,\nThe brave who fight, and will not hide.\nMay their dreams of freedom soar and fly,\nAnd light the path for all to try.",
