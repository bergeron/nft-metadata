    "description": "Decades ago, a grade school  teacher chastised me when I drew a landscape picture with a black sun. For the longest time I thought I did something wrong, but turns out...Suns can be black...if you want them to be.  \n\nThis piece is hand drawn then converted to code art. \n\nDraw what you want, create what you feel, leave the critics to their popcorn and canap√©s.",
