How many full scholarship talents are there?\n\n\n\nThey represent the bulk of the team, but the remaining role players are also important.\n\n\n\nMarquette doesn't have the luxury of a top school like Duke or North Carolina.\n\n\n\nThese teams are filled with talented high school students, even five-star high school students!",
