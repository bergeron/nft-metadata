    "description": "chasing ghosts is a song about that toxic type of relationship where you should walk away but for some reason you can’t stop chasing it. \n\nEveryone has been in one of those relationships where it was great in the beginning, where you felt so madly in-love but after time passes you realize that you’re stuck in a toxic cycle, constantly trying to repair it and regain the feelings that are long dead. In the song Chelsea and I also explored topics of substance abuse and how that specifically can destroy a relationships integrity.",
