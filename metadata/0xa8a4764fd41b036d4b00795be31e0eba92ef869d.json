    "description": "This Lil Noun Spirited Vodka is the inaugural launch NFT of Liquid Collections.\nThis is the first in a series of exclusive, collectible ultra-premium spirits made in collaboration with artists. Launching with a unique Lil Noun, Liquid Collections created a ghostly-inspired, limited-edition vodka, only available via NFT.\nMade of locally sourced winter wheat from a farm in Washington state, this Spirited vodka has been artisanally crafted, triple-distilled, and freeze-filtered before being blended with ultra-pure water from the Cascade mountain range.\n\nGo to the collection page https://liquidcollections.com/lil-noun-vodka for redemption logistics, FAQs and to sign up for notifications via email.\n\nWhen bottles have been claimed, the NFT image will show a bottle on its side and the words “Bottles Collected” at the bottom right corner.\n",
