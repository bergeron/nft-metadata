    "description": "What does naked body mean for you? I admire naked bodies, because we are part of Nature, and Nature is the most impeccable artist, right? Everything about Nature is perfect. I think the naked body is aesthetics and sensuality, it is independence. And of course itâ€™s creativity. My rule is to see and convey the beauty of the curves of the female body, its fragility and at the same time strength, to convey how beautiful and sophisticated any body can look, and not just those that are usually seen according to imposed standards in the media",
