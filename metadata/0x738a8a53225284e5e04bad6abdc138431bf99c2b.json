    "description": "'Bènèdiction', means 'blessings' in French, paying homage to the French province of the stone. The inspiration for the scene is derived from the concept that blessing and abundance is, or should be, the catalyst of sharing and giving - an idea imported from the (Jewish) practice of 'Bikurim', or 'First Fruits'.\n\nAs all ALMA installations, Bènèdiction is composed of two parts. One is the stone, of which Bènèdiction in which this case is a slab of genuine French marble Breccia De Vendome Marble measuring 104ft x 60ft x .75ft and hangs in the elegant SALT Steakhouse on the Jersey Shore. No alterations or any physical work was done to the face of the marble.\n\nThe art display on the marble is solely a fade-in, fade-out light projection on particular portions of the stone, accentuating the previously hidden natural art scene within its veins. Although when viewed at without the stone the NFT is only half complete, when overlayed on the stone, the scene becomes clear to visitors of the stone on ocation. As the light fades out, the scene remains discernable, forever elevating the stone into a canvas of distinctive art.",
