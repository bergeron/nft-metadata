    "description": "Every layer of red coming out of the skin could represent a single matter of cosmos reflections into us. In this reflection, each red layer is a cosmic story from the depth of history and in this matter, our body is generated by blood. Our blood is a dynamical interpreter for the history of humanity & our eyes are monitoring. The cosmos begins to create the upcoming stories of history by learning this RED appliance of the human blood. That is the reason of human history repetition over and over in past.\nRed is the oppression of human rights symbol in this look. How much can you feel it by watching that look!\n\nThis is a charcoal-basement try of this effect on canvas, using the watercolor for each layer of RED.\n\nRespect . pschainhox \n",
