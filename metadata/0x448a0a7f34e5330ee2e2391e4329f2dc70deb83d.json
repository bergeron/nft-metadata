    "description": "Bunny Moon [兔달]: the composite spirit of @tygrpuppy and @play_w_cc\n\nsighting #17: Bunny was spotted in Miami, FL on 12/4/2021, shadow dancing in the heat of a club during Art Basel. Falcons was spinning afrobeat, and everyone was clearly spun. There seemed to be a seam rip between dimensions, the universe collided and burst out the deepest color blue. CC & Juni, like two stars aligned, whose lights become one. This token represents a plane shift -- a story physical and metaphysical, sensual and effervescent. Don’t lose sight. \n\ninstagram:\n@play_w_cc & @tigerrabbittiger\n\ntwitter:\n@play_w_cc & @tygrpuppy\n\nmedium:\nbody paint, digital assemblage, poster paper, self-portrait photography\n",
