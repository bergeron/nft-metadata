    "description": "This marks the first of many small steps in a great journey. \n\n This piece is a redraw of a drawing I did in 2016. Fresh out of high school, I had fallen victim to Imposter Syndrome and believed that my creative expression left little to no meaningful impression. The drawing was the very last thing I drew in 2016 that felt authentic to me before I sent myself down a nearly 5 year spiral of harsh self criticism.\n\nKnown for their beauty, dahlias are also tied to longevity, fortitude and commitment due to their ability to bloom after many other flowers have died. \nMuch like this flower,  I feel the spirit of my art has lasted many dark nights and has only bloomed ever since. I feel pride in myself for pushing through and starting this new chapter in my career with a rebirth. \n\n  May she be a reminder to you of your own beauty and fortitude.",
