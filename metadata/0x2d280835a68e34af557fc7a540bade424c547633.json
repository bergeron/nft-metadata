    "description": "While I was wandering around the streets of Ankara, where I live, to take pictures, cheerful children's voices came from the other side of the street. When I entered the other side of the street where the voices were coming from, I saw children playing in the street where the sun coming from the opposite direction was getting more pronounced and the smoke from the stove chimney was spreading around. Their mothers were also taking care of their children. The moment I pressed the button of my camera, it was as if my own childhood was standing in front of me.\n\nEdition: 1/1\nSize: 3886× 2591pixel – 13,1 MB\nFile: jpeg 300 dpi\nLocation: Ankara, Turkey\nDate: 08 November 2018\nPhotographer: Nurşen COŞAR\n\n",
