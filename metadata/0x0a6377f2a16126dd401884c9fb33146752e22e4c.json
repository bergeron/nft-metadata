    "description": "\"with impatient fingers, I am memorising you  \ndesperately by heart in emotional explosion...\"\n\n\nDarkness of the soul crossed with the happy splashes of moments, memories and experiences.\n\nI have been creating digital art most of my life and I have found that working with actual paint and canvas without an option to edit/cut or trim if something is not right was way more fun.\n\nTitle has been inspired by the accidental making of the vein like textures on the circle that have appeared after pressing paint on canvas board with plexiglass.\n\nAbstract is my second favourite style (first one is photography which is a completely different medium) hence the choice. I like expressing emotions with objects and elements that are not obvious at the first sight.\n\njanuary 2023",
