    "description": "Fine Art Asia NFT 2021 Presents: 《#Summerclouds》, Yeung Yi Ching (Rice)\n\nThe inspiration of this work comes from a Zitan wooden pillow used for pulse-reading of Qing Dynasty. It was carved with continuous auspicious cloud motif, linked together to form a endless vortex. I was struck by the craftsmanship of Qing dynasty artist who can seamlessly blend the cloud motif into the shape of the pillow. It made me wonder, “What if a modern-day person come across a real auspicious cloud, what would that person do?” I tried to expand the auspicious cloud to the size of a real cloud. I was immediately brought to the seaside of mid-summer. When a young girl carrying her inflatable swim ring come across a massive auspicious cloud, she must first take a selfie with it and post on social media. Only after that, will she jump into the water to enjoy the nice summer day.",
