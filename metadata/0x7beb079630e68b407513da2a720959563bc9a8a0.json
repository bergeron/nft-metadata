    "description": "ABOUT THE RELEASE:\n\nWelcome to the Fever Dream sessions.\n\nThe songs from this session have an energy that came from being pent up and isolated for over a year during lockdown, to being around each other again and playing music in the same room. And it wasn't just any room either, our friend Darrell Thorp invited us to record this 3-track session in the gorgeous rooms at The Village in LA.\n\nAfter an anxious year of pandemics, covid variants, personal health scares, and all the other bad juju the quarantine era brought, this session was a perfect oasis to break the anxiety that had built up since the lockdown began.\n\nThat's why the joyous energy had us buzzing. How cool was it to be around each other again, playing music with the best people, in the best place? Hopefully, some of that good vibe comes through in the music, and that the songs will help release the feverish anxiety into joyous catharsis.\n\nTrack 2 of 3: The Last Time (Heavy)\n\nThe lyrics for this song come from a collaboration with Edson's longtime friend Steady Holiday (Andrea \"Dre\" Babinski). While writing together, the two began riffing off the neurosis of feeling like the world is ending, and how we regular people can't do much about it...which is a strange helpless-but-kind-of-relieved-of-the-responsibility feeling. It's that dichotomy that the song tries to ride; burdened but upbeat, feeling heavy but willing to dance with what we have left.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nco-produced/engineered/mixed by Darrell Thorp\nRecorded at The Village in Los Angeles, CA\nMastered by Ian Sefchick\n\nVocals, Guitars, keys: Edson Choi\nGuitars, Synths: Mike Nissen\nJonathan Bradley: Drums\n\nWritten by Edson Choi and Talk Time\n\nAdditional players:\nBass: John Ransom Tucker\n\nCover Art: Mike Nissen\nGolden Egg Art: Lauren Jennings Piper\n\nLyrics:\n\nHeavy as a paper flag\nWhat's the word when you're not sorry?\nSomedays I just disappear \nWords that fail your sad sob story\nFocus, argue\nFor You\n\nDon't you worry about the weekend\nEvery time you feel the flames\nSomething happened to you last time\nSo don't wonder why I ain't the same\n\nHeavy for an honest man\nHeavy for the things I fell for sure\nHeavy when we're flying high\nThem hypocrites will always have an answer\nFocus, argue\n\nDon't you worry about the weekend\nEvery time you feel the flames\nSomething happened to you last time\nSo don't wonder why I ain't the same\n\nDon't you worry about destruction\nEvery time you feel the flames\nSomething happened to you last time \nAnd no party line is there to blame\n\nSo don't worry that you're broken\nEvery time you hear your name\nSomething happened to us last time\nSo they wonder why we aren’t the same\n\n©2023 Talk Time",
