    "description": "In this new collection I explore the repeating geometric patterns that can be found in the architecture of our cities. From towering apartment blocks to intricate brickwork and industrial materials, these patterns are a constant presence in our daily lives.\n\nThrough this collection I aim to capture the beauty and complexity of these industrial patterns, and to consider the impact they have on our emotions and our experience of the urban environment.",
