It is composed of 15 unique images that are all 1/1.\n\nThis collection is a reflection of my idea to inspire people to travel and to see more of the world. Our planet is so unique and for me as a photographer, I try to capture those unique things. I dedicate this collection to you, and I hope you will cherish these unique 1/1 editions to remember to travel further, to push harder and to never settle.",
