    "description": "February 24. 4 a.m. The whole country shuddered at the unprecedented and unhealthy aggression from Russia. Troops led by a mentally ill commander-in-chief attacked a peaceful country, \"Ukraine. Acting exactly like the Nazis, they began bombing peaceful cities and killing women and children. The Ukrainian military forces repelled the attack, but the losses were enormous. Death will long walk the battlefield and collect the souls of fallen soldiers.\n\nCreated by Anton Perepelytsia\nTwitter: @AntonPerepelyt1",
