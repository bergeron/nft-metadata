    "description": "This work is a conceptual one in which I have tried to put reality, human, and dreams in one frame. The inevitable reality from which human takes refuge in a dream to escape.\nWomen of our society and their problems they are struggling with are my main inspiration to create this work. It seems that social and cultural issues are with them anytime, anywhere, rooted in all aspects of their existence.\nThis work fits in with my previous works named “hope” and “Justice”, parts of \"These Days\" series. \n\nOil on canvas (size:79 X 113 cm)",
