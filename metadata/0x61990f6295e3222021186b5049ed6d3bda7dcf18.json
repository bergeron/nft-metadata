    "description": "What if we were allowed more time to fully indulge in a painting, enabling us to become fully immersed in it? Like stepping into a portal that transports you into a vivid and wondrous world of color and texture, the boundaries between the art and the viewer begin to blur and fade away. It's a feeling of being so completely entranced by the art that it seems to come alive before your very eyes as if the paint is still wet and the images are still in motion. It's a sense of being absorbed into the very fabric of the artwork, of becoming a part of its story, and of feeling the emotions and passions that inspired its creation. Please allow yourself more time.",
