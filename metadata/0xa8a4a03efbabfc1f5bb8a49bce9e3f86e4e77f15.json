    "description": "Earth based time of transformation. Regression and progression as a black and white are forming the pattern – the pattern of “fast transformation”. The fast interpretation of the perception reacts on the most visible edges fast. The most fast reaction, the most fast analysis, the most fast transformation, the most fast result. Black and white pattern is the pattern of borders.\nErase your matrix and go clear to the next perception with “Earth Time Ratio” ! The artwork shows the number of generated templates of abstract minimalistic digital sets. This is a visual movement of black and white matrix. Forming a perception borders we can hear by eyes and see by ears.\n",
