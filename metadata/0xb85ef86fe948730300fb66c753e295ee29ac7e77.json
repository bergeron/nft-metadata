    "description": "Midnight black mask covering a long, anguished face. Dancing red eyes, set delicately behind his exoskeleton mask, watch faithfully over the haven they've shown mercy on for so long.\n\nA tattoo of a small lion is prominently featured just below his left eye leaves a pleasurable memory of lost honor.\n\nThis is the face of Shota Rokettorancha, a true angel among ninjas. He stands oddly among others, despite his muscled frame.\n\nThere's something wonderful about him, perhaps it's his goodwill or perhaps it's simply his company. But nonetheless, people tend to follow him, while learning as much about him as possible.",
