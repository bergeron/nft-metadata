    "description": "Made in Blender & Substance Painter  \nPNG  \n1080x1920\n\nA piece about how there are so many aspects of life that we cannot change, but rather than kick against and fight it we should accept and embrace it. Only then will we find true freedom and happiness.\n\nInspired by a very personal and emotional experience in my life that led to many events that were out of my control. These events brought me a lot of pain and even inspired one of my older pieces, but I'm using this piece as a way to accept it and to let it go. To only hold onto the good that came from it.\n\nIncorporated the conditions of Daria's art contest into the piece by turning the provided flower into a dress to make an interpretation of Gaia. This in turn helped me with the context of the concept.",
