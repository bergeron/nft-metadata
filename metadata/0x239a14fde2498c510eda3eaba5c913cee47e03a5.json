    "description": "# Forms + Shapes\n\nFeaturing 120 NFTs designed during the period from 2016 to 2021, this launch marks the last 6 years of Peter's creative output and extends far beyond his signature style.\n\nArtist's growth can be seen in his ever-evolving techniques as he experiments with contrasting forms, and more recently non-functional architectural environments in this largest collection to date. Perfectly balanced color palettes and perspective as well as thoughtful compositions aim to provide a unique visual experience.\n\nPeter Tarka  is a 3D Artist and Art Director working in high-visibility commercial space for more than a decade. Based out of London, he runs a studio collaborating with some of the biggest brands on the planet.",
