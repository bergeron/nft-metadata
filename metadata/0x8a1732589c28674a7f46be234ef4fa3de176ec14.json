The item is brought to life in an even more personal way through Alex Lifeson's exclusive audio narration, which is minted as part of this NFT. \n\n Narration: \n\n \"Here's Stan. 1970 Les Paul Standard. I recorded 2112 with this guitar, and I used it live for 2112 on every tour that we played, really loved playing it. It was a great workhorse. I used it for a lot of things, and it shows with all the marks on the back of the body, belt marks and scratches. That guitar was around and it's got some history to it.\"",
