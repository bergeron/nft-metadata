    "description": "The Sound Of Natura\n\nMother Nature uses little to no words, but the few that she uses are eloquent, in the forms of her blessings. We can only appreciate its blessings whenever she wants to give them, the tranquillity we feel when we hear water flowing, birds chirping, tree leaves dancing with the wind. This sensation is difficult to put into words, but the impact to the soul is calming, peaceful, and filled with love and comfort.\n\nFormat :  1920 x 1080\nMp4, WAV\n\nVisual : Aloysius Nitia\nAudio : At Nite In Space ( Aloysius Nitia & Anggi Fadillah )",
