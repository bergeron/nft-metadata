    "description": "Hey Everyone, \n\nWelcome to the #001 chapter of Alnwick. I'm Alnwick, a girl who is living in sci-fi city of  \" Buceim \". \n\nBy the way you can call me AL, cos my frens call me AL. One thing excites me the most and that is childhood pictures of my parents. I can't believe there were so many trees and we could actually sit under them or touch them. \n\nAAAHHH, I'm envy of my parents childhood days, they were so lucky. They say that there was no need to pay oxygen bills in their childhood period and that's so cool because most of my income goes to pay that oxy bill :/\n\nMy mom says, everything has changed a lot in last 50 years. I think she is right, cos a virtual world created by a metaverse company called NATURE. I visited there once and I still can't believe there were so many oxygen, trees, food, animals and many more. AAAAA i wanna go back :'(\n\nBut right now I have to go because I have to attend a virtual concert with my frens. \n\nBYE, BIG HUGSS ^ ^\nSEE YOU IN NEXT CHAPTER !!! ",
