    "description": "Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world with amazing skyline and architecture. The best view of Dubai Cityscape is when it is seen floating on occasional foggy days. If you are lucky enough to get to a vantage point and fog is below you, you get to to see this mesmerizing view.\nThis image is taken on such day early in 2021 after my several failed attempts to capture Floating Dubai in Fog.\n\nAbout Photographer -  Naiju is a Nature and cityscape photographer based in United Arab Emirates basically from India. Settling in Dubai was his dream while doing Engineering studies in Kerala , India. Finally, he managed to get to Dubai in 2013. Soon he found passion in photography and photographing Dubai, the city which allowed him to live his dream, was his first choice.\n\nAll images in this collection is 1/1 images\n\nFile size :- 5691 x 3799 - 300 dpi",
