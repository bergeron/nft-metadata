Quieten, and listen for the response. \n\nFrom a series of works comprising Meta.morphosis, an infrared medium format photographic essay. \n\nMeta.morpohsis evokes a suspended state and the delicate transitions we make between worlds, real and imagined. Between lives lived digitally and our lived experience of the natural world. Between lucid thought and insanity.",
