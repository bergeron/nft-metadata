    "description": "We must always protect nature from damage so that our children and grandchildren in the future can enjoy it like what we are enjoying now.\n\nMaintaining the balance of nature can make the life lived by living things better. Not only humans, but also other living things such as animals and plants.\n\nBy living up to the importance of protecting nature, we can be kept away from negative traits that can harm ourselves and others.\n\nDate Created : 12/03/23\n4096 x 6144 px"
