    "description": "A fisherman's hut along the Black Sea. \n\n“A Fish in the Sky” is a series of photos I made along the Black Sea in and around Constanta, Romania. The images explore the dichotomy of hope and abandonment I saw in this area where there is also a lyrical chaos in much of daily life and beauty in the details.",
