    "description": "FLY by ParraDeSys is a meticulously curated collection of aviation photography from 2015-2021. It is a celebration of air shows, airplanes, and the people who fly them. The collection consists of 77 1/1 single-frame photographs captured over a period of 7 years. \n\nEach photo was taken without a tripod. They all have minimal editing.  None of the photos are composites. \n\nThere are three tiers. Each tier has unique collectors’ perks as well as future utility like “care packages” that will be airdropped to specific token holders.\n\nThis collection is minted with Manifold (ERC-721).",
