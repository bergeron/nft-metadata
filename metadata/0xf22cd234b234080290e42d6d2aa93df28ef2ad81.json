    "name": "The Dance Of Fire & Water",
    "description": "Fire and water, both are classical elements and are crucial for survival and without one or the other, we would not be here today. Yet, when out of control they both cause devasting havoc. It has always amazed me that hydrogen is highly flammable and oxygen is accelerant, yet somehow combined, they create the opposite to fire.\nThis piece is based on the concept of yin and yang, with fire & water in an eternal dance, both limiting each other elements movements.",
