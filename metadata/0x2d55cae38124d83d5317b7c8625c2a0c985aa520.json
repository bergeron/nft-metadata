    "description": "All these thoughts running wild at night. They build up the feeling of panic haunting the mind. The feeling of losing from death. It is causing panic that is caused by your own head. \n\nThis monster inside the mind the sound of hiss in the ear. Better make friends with it to be able to bear. No other way because it will always be near. The only option is to face this fear.      \t\n\nDigital painting | 2023",
