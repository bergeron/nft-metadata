    "name": "90 seconds of oil tanker Solar Tine, Catskill",
    "description": "Tracking and photographing the various oil tankers, cargo ships and tugboats on the Hudson River. \n\nThrough the time-stretching effects of a long exposure, I seek to reflect on the modes of 20th century transportation, consumption and the changing views of this magnificent river the Native Americans referred to as Mahicantuck – “the river that flows both ways”. \n\nA portion of the proceeds will be donated to support the preservation of the Hudson River.",
