    "description": "I love the city, I love the night. I love the feeling when the sun has set and the city slowly calms down. The darkness takes over and the lights of the city try to drive it away. Perception changes at night, the surroundings become something else. Something that is built from one's own imagination and fears. In my imagination, my preferences for electronic music and the cyberpunk genre merge with the lights of the night to create a special atmosphere. \n\nI love to walk through the city at night and photograph. Through shadows and light always arise new motifs in the most colorful lights. Not only because of this I love street photography at night. Frankfurt is a very lively city and there is hardly the opportunity to have a little rest during the day. At night it is different. More fresh air, less noise. It feels like the city blossoms at night. I am less afraid of the city at night than during the day. At night the world is a little smaller and it's easier to hide.\n\nThis picture was taken on a bridge over the river Main. In the late night, is the only possibility for this photo, because all bridges, with such a view, are traveled or even more wavering.",
