    "description": "The sea was a beautiful, mystical place. It was home to many magical creatures, including the Ghostly Pirate Ship. The ship was said to be cursed, and it sailed the seas in search of prey. Many sailors had been lost to the ship, and it was said that their souls were trapped on board. The ship was said to be able to change its appearance, and it was often seen as a beautiful, majestic ship. But those who saw it up close, saw the true horror that lurked beneath.",
