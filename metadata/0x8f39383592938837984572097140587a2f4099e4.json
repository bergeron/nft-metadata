    "description": "In the sea of time, the choices we make are as numerous water droplets in an endless ocean. How we react to the good, bad, and even the mundane that befalls us, changes the trajectory of who we become... thereby shaping our very souls. Embrace today. Become who you were meant to be. For we are forged by our past, present, and future - our lives but melodies played on the strings of destiny. Always Wanna Degens are a hand-drawn, generative collection. 100% Degen art. No roadmap. No utility.",
