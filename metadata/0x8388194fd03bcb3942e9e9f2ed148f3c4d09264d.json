    "description": "This work was inspired by a story that I happened to see in the text of an ad on a theme site, I was touched by a father's reverent attitude towards his little daughter, who made these cute paper dogs. \n\nThe text of the ad:\n\"We sell pre-made toys and take orders to make them. When buying from 4pcs discount. Friends who are not difficult, just write or call, pretend you're interested. My daughter made and every day asks: \"Has anyone written? Did someone call?\"\nI'm not asking you to buy, I'll give her the money myself, just write or call if it's not difficult for you.\"\n\nI find it very sweet and funny at the same time, a real caring and attentive father and a little daughter taking her first steps in business. )\n\nIf this story makes you feel positive and like my idea - I will be glad and grateful for your support, it's my first steps as an NFT author.\n\nIf there is a demand for the collection on the secondary market and I earn something from it, a part of the income will go to my dad and daughter, the rest I will use for my next collection, in which I will try not to forget about the first followers of my great journey.\n\nI would also like to thank the guy with the nickname MrStarkOff, if it wasn't for him, I might have missed this incredible story.\n\nMint price - 0 | 2 pcs wallet | Total supply - 319 | Creator earnings 3%\n(if I did everything right, then there will be rare specimens in the collection)\n\n__\nMyracleRay.eth",
