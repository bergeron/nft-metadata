    "description": "This piece is based on a physical painting from [Jacques Tange](https://jacquestange.art/), an award-winning Dutch Artist of the Year. It is a satirical look on the current crypto 'bear market' posing the inflection points between the public negativity felt in the crypto market, and the bitcoin maxi stance of endeavoring to power through. This is represented by the laser eyes and the bitcoin logo belly, as the satirically large cartoon bear meanders through an empty town. \n\nCreated in collaboration with [Grypto](https://www.grypto.company/)",
