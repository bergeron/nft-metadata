    "description": "Two unknown men, captured in an intimate moment, the gentle hand rested upon the shoulder. It's believed that many of these painted men were friends of Charles. However, it is sometimes unclear their relationship with the painter. In this work, we also see Charles developing his use of colorful brushstrokes, a trend that would be dominant in his 30s.  \n\nInscription (from reverse):  \nHow I wanted to be them. Their muscles radiated in the spring.",
