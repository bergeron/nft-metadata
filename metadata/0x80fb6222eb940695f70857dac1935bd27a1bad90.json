    "description": "A lone rider prepares his horse ahead of the Kiplingcotes Derby. \n15 March 2012\n\nRun every year at Kiplingcotes in the East Riding of Yorkshire, the Derby is accepted to be the oldest annual horse race in the English sporting calendar. It began in 1519 and takes place on the third Thursday in March, often in dreadful weather. \n\nThe course covers 4 miles of arduous farm tracks and horses of any age can be ridden. All those wishing to enter must gather by the starting post by 11 a.m. on the morning of the Derby. \n\nThe rules state that if the race is not run one year, then it must never be run again.",
