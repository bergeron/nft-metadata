    "description": "Billing Road 2, part of my series Pretty Mundane, was taken in 2019. The premise for the project is to acknowledge and appreciate the little things in life. Moments that really do matter, throughout lifeâ€™s strikes and gutters. \n\nI would walk past this block of flats in Northampton almost every day, yet the light spoke with such clarity that night, it had me like a tractor beam.
