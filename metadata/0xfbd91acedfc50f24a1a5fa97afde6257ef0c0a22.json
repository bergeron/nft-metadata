    "description": "Each woman is portrayed through an opaque cellophane. Model and photographer never meet. Each occupies their own half of the studio. The intimacy of the person portrayed is guaranteed, and she is always “protected” by the cellophane diaphragm.\n\nThe project investigates the observer's perception of the body and beauty. It is a project that proclaims the beauty of every person and every body.",
