    "description": "To me, a Persian handmade carpet has always been the symbol of achieving glorious beauty through overcoming pain and suffering. A carpet weaver, typically a woman, is faced with endless nights and days to give birth to such a complex and rich form of art. Just like a mother singing to her newborn child, they keep singing along with weaving each warp and woof, a process that could take months if not years.\nThey put a part of their souls into the creation of carpets. They become one with their art which makes the carpet a living being, a child growing up to represent the perfect ideal of the mother.\n\nDimensions : 2000x2000 pixels",
