    "description": "What happens when you’re just light, caught in a dream, unable to find your place in this world, struggling to see yourself and realize that you’re just an aberration of the entities around you?\n\nThe Aberrations series is all about diving into the splash of color at the edge of our vision. A Chromatic Aberration is typically considered an unwanted color distortion in photography. Here, Aberrations are used to create ethereal depth and beauty. This is all realized by utilizing an iterative parallax mapping technique that blends these unwanted beauties together creating an uncertain organic-like feeling.\n\nThis piece was created entirely in the GLSL coding language with 343 lines of code. No 2D or 3D software used. Rendered at 4k resolution at 60fps.\n\n\n\n\n",
