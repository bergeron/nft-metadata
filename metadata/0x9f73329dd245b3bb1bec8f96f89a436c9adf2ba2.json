    "description": "Liquid Window #1 (blue) is part of the series Liquid Windows, a collection of digital animations created using a combination of moir√© patterning and post-processing techniques. Within the series, each work depicts a vertical window rendered through liquid motions, organic shapes and pixel patterns. In my visual research, the window is often used as a metaphor of screen space: a portal towards a multiplicity of spaces oscillating between depth and flatness, abstraction and figuration, fantasy and reality. Liquid Windows extends this research by manifesting window frames in a seemingly ethereal or liquified state. In doing so, the series reconsiders the window as a fluid and dream-like object, a remnant of materiality within a digital realm.",
