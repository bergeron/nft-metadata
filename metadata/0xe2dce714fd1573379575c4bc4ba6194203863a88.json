    "description": "The Ganges Boy\n\nThe Ganges is the most holy river in India. It is said to have medicinal power - and a long history of cleansing and purification. People bathe in it, drink from it, even jump in it for good luck. It's also symbolic of life's cycles and reversals - death and rebirth. This is Banaras - still unregulated by time or geography. A place where old meets new, self-reflection meets commerce, youth meets age.\n\nThe children playing in the Ganges evoke feelings of joy in me. The children are jumping into the Ganges and retrieving religious items thrown in it and retrieve it for they daily earnings. \n\nAfter clicking this Frame I decided to name it  “The Ganges Boy”\n\nThis picture recently got exhibited in one of India’s renowned Art Galleries The Jehangir Art Gallery and got appreciation from multiple people from different genre’s. This is really a huge achievement for me.\n\nLocation  : Varanasi, India.\nEdition : 1/1\nDimensions : 4000 x 3000",
