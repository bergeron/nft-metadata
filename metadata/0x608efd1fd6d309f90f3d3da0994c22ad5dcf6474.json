    "description": "Day Dreaming - Moving to Canada from Australia in 2016 was a big part of my newfound love for landscape photography. Fresh out of university I had a burning desire to travel and going to the furthest place away seemed ideal. \n\nI had so many photos saved of dream locations I wanted to see but itâ€™s nothing like experiencing it in real life. Nearly one year in and a long list of places I'd been dreaming of for years, a 10 day road trip and camera in hand. Dreams were becoming reality. \n\nMaligne Lake is a popular spot for good reason but I never thought I would see in this magnitude. Camping out in my Toyota Forrester in Jasper the night before, I set myself a goal to see this lake for sunrise. A 4am wake up and a 45 minute drive out of town brought me to an empty carpark and the thickest dark clouds you could imagine. I thought there was no way I would get a sunrise but I was commitment to the cause. From within minutes of gathering my camera gear and trying to wake myself up, I turned around to the sky transforming in front of my eyes. First a subtle pink reflecting on the bottom of the clouds quickly turned into a full blown colour show of radiating purples, pinks and reds. The adrenaline you get as a photographer when you know you are about to capture one of your best photos is indescribable. My day dreaming became my reality, something I had in my head for years was now a tangible item. This is one of the images that started my love for landscape photography and I wanted to share that with as many people as possible. \n\nEdition of 25\n\nLicense: editorial",
