I also used drawing techniques in some portions of the artwork. I wanted to draw attention to stray animals in a humorous way.\n\n \nPaintings used:  \n\nGreek Girls Picking up Pebbles by the Sea - Frederic Leighton  \n\nSaint Sebastian - Guido Reni  \n\nParis street, Rainy Day - Gustave Caillebotte  \n\nThe Little Street - Johannes Vermeer",
