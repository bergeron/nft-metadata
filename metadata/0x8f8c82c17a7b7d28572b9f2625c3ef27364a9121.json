    "description": "I have always been fascinated by the concept of time and how \nphotography can immortalize a moment.\n\nIn the 1990s, when I was younger and free of serious responsibilities, I did quite a bit of street photography on my travels. While I don’t consider myself a photographer by any measure, during that time I managed to capture a few truly special moments on film. Moments that can each tell a different story. \n\nThis is not however a photo collection. Above all else I am a graphic designer and my greatest passion is typography.\n\n“Moments in Type” is a photo-typographic collection of unique \nmoments in everyday life, capured on film and combined with \ntype to create nine distinct conceptual compositions. Each  piece \nincorporates its title as a typographic element, integrated within the composition. All of the photos are candid. \n\nThe camera used was a Canon FTb with a Canon 50mm 1:1.4 lens and all photos were developed by me personally.\n\n6529er",
