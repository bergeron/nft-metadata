    "description": "This image was inspired by a story about the Buddha. No matter how the stories are told in different countries, there will be more stories to add. But one thing that people who practice this religion see the Buddha as a person who is pure and free from all impurities. The revelators compare the Buddha to the lotus because lotusâ€™ petals and leaves are unique in that they do not get wet and even grow in the mud; they remain untainted by the mud and without tarnishing. It is also fragrant and even when the petals wither, the color remains unfading.",
