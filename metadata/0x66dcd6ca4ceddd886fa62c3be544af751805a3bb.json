    "description": "This is the first instalment of a two-part series and represents my initial step into a new larger body of art that I've been working so hard on over the past six months.\n\nIt is the result of trawling through old work and trying to pull out the elements that make me the happiest and also trying to push the technical side of my work much further along. Selene came at a time of a lot of introspection, but also one of excitement and I hope that feeling is present in the work.\n\nI am so excited to have new art in the world again and also to begin finally releasing the rest of this new work over the coming year.\n",
