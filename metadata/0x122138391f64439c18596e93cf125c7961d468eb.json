    "description": "I met this guy sitting at the entrance to Pak Khlong flower market. With his tattoos, chains, ID card and dent in his forehead he was quite a striking character, & was happy for me to photograph him and have a brief chat. Unfortunately my Thai wasn't good enough to find out his story which I'm sure would've been fascinating, and I've not been able to find him again since. \n\nBangkok, October 2021",
