    "description": "This artwork is the first edition 1/1 to the 'Silent Mystique' series that I decided to create.\nThis piece in particular is an oil painting done on canvas, which was referenced from a \nphotograph by Muhammadtaha (@planeteelevene). \n\nIt is my first attempt with hyperrealistic portraiture. The name silent mystique was inspired by the model in the painting (Aamraah). On the image she is displaying a very interesting pose and her striking eyes exudes a rather mysterious and cryptic expression. \n\nThis is one of the most captivating \npaintings I have done, and thus compelled me to create an NFT version of it. So much so that I will be working on a 3 part series! ",
