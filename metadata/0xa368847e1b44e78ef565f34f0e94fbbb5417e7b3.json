    "description": "Voyager in the enigmatic cosmos of the mind, adrift in the nebulous mist of thought and emotion, wrestling with the spectral echoes of past, present, and future.\n\n.jpg 6800x10200\n\nDin Burns is an AI artist who explores themes of the human psyche. He is trying to find a visual representation of the different states of the human soul. Fear, apathy, despair, shame, loss of identity, and attempts to look inside oneself are constant motifs that can be traced in one way or another in all his works."
