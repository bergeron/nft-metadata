    "description": "Some images are easy to edit with the wave naturally guiding me through the process, this image however i found incredibly challenging because of its natural beauty  i must have edited it at least 10 times with different variations to finally land on this one where i feel i have done the image justice.  This moment stands out to me as a highlight of what was a crazy trip of 3 days with a total of 22 hours on the ocean shooting two different locations with over 1800km traveled with very little sleep, was it worth it? hell yes.......",
