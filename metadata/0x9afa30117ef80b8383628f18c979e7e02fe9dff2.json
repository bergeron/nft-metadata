    "description": "A huge ancient creature with a height of about 80 meters has been living in the most remote places of the las for about 500 years.  According to legend, the body of this creature is the skeleton of a huge elk, and this massive creature is controlled by the spirit of an old hermit hunter who lived completely alone deep in the forest.  One night, the hunter burned down in a huge fire in the forest, the cause of the fire was children from a wealthy family.  They loved to play with fire and gunpowder, which caused a fire, which they decided not to tell anyone about, and the whole old forest burned out.  The spirit of the hunter moved into this huge entity, which now protects the forest from people who harm it.",
