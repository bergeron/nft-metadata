    "description": "Pepe, oh Pepe, where did you go?  \nMissing the green days, the profits that flow.  \nYou thought you were a genius, a crypto king,  \nBut now you're just another hodler, holding nothing.\n\nYour portfolio's crashed, your coins are dead,  \nThe bull run's over, it's all in your head.  \nYou remember the hype, the fomo so real,  \nBut now it's just regret, and a bitter pill to feel.\n\nYou miss the days of Lambos and moon,  \nThe feeling of winning, so bright like a boon.  \nBut now you're broke, your bank account in the red,  \nAnd you wish you had listened to what everyone said.\n\nOh Pepe, don't worry, it's just a game,  \nCrypto's a rollercoaster, it's never the same.  \nHold on tight, and keep your head up high,  \nAnd soon the green days will return, and you'll fly.\n\nOh Pepe, don't lose hope, don't give up the fight,  \nThe market may be down, but it will take flight.  \nYour fortunes will rise, your investments will soar,  \nAnd the green days will come back, just like before.",
