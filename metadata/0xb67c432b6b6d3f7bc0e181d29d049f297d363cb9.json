    "description": "Vulnerable\" is an emotional awakening in song form. It explores the idea of vulnerability being human nature; something we all go through within our lives in one way or another. Such alien and uncomfortable feelings can make us feel very alone and stagnant. The harmonic arrangements within the vocals help to reflect just how emotionally complex we are as humans and that it can be very hard to switch these emotions off at times. We hope this song connects with people on a deeper level and bring an elements of comfort to those who need it.",
