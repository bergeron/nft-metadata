    "description": "● Artist - DOMINIC ROUSE\n● Title - The Art of Mediocrity (Manufacturing Consent)\n● File - JPEG 3664 x 4808 Pixels\n\nA montage of numerous disparate images photographed in various corners of the globe.\n\n\"Dominic Rouse sets out in search of the voices of the past, the gigantic aspiration to Art. He turns to the mountains of figuration, from the Gothic to the Baroque, from the Enlightenment to Romanticism. Through photography he reclaims their forbidden territories, the realms of the strange and deformed, the sublime and the terrifying; he recovers the ineffable, disturbing, extraordinary & repellent beauty that leads from Bosch, Boticelli, Velasquez and Goya to Moreau, Redon, Picasso and Kubin. He portrays the world of the present as a dystopian chaos, the mad accumulation of things and acts, people and events.\"\n\n*PLEASE NOTE - the listing image is not the hi-res JPEG. This will be sent to the buyer's wallet on completion of the sale.\n\n© Dominic H Rouse MMXXII All Rights Reserved",
