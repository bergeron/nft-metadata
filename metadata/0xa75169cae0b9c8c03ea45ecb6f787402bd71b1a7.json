    "description": "I’ve been very lucky to travel around the world and while doing so I’ve documented culture, landscapes, wildlife, architecture and everything in between. This particular shot was during a visit to the incredibly beautiful country of New Zealand in the outskirts of Queenstown. It was a magical sunset to say the least but the large lake and the mountains in the background made for a jaw dropping view; it felt surreal. I shot this with a 70-200mm lens which is not often used for landscape but I love the compression it gives for these kinds of shots. ",
