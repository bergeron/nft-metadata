    "description": "By capturing an instant of\nmovement, artist Olga Prudka immortalizes motion as dynamic stillness. And by manipulating the\n\nperspective of her shots, she imbues this perpetual moment with political significance. Against the blue-\nsky background, the dancers' translucent yellow garb evokes the Ukrainian flag, transforming their dance\n\ninto an embodiment of the country's strength: Even in darkness, Ukraine perseveres, united and\nunwavering, towards freedom.",
