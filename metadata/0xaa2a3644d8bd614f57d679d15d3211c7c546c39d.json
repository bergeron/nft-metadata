    "description": "Your Touch is a love letter to club music, its about what makes music unique, how it reaches out and touches our lives, attaches its self to memories, moments and people. For me so much of that is connected to London and Uk dance music. When I was writing the song it took me back to all those emotions and memories that are attached to everyone the song touches on it’s journey through to the rave.. it’s like that emotion being passed down till it gets to live in the club. It’s more than sound, you’re transported back to a moment, a feeling and all the emotions you felt then…. the song becomes a part of so many different peoples lives in different ways.\n\nWritten and produced by Sound of Fractures\n\nDirected by Natalia Alejarra\n",
