    "description": "ZUMA VALLEY EXPEDITION:\n\n57th day at the Valley.\nAfter 2 weeks of heavy rains, we were finally able to find one of the Busts. \nAccording to Monsieur Leclerc, it is expected to be found 6 more Statues on this Valley.\nThe positioning of the 7 statues will indicate the direction and distance of the buried Pylon.\nThe foreign commissioners and local authorities are also becoming enthusiastic.\nThe goal is to find the underground Temple. \nThis first Anubis bust is already being shipped to Grenoble. \nThe expedition already evolved from expected projections to something tangible.\nWe are dealing with a lot of muddy soil, which ironically is helping us with the excavations.\nThe superstitious ones are already saying that higher forces are leading us to find the Temple.\nMany more excavation days will come, and a mix of uplifting moments and Valley sunsets are expected.",
