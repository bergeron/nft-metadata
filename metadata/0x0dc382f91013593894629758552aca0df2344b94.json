    "description": "Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are flourishing in urban areas in the UK and across the globe. Some figures suggest that there could be up to 150,000 foxes now living in predominantly urban areas. \n\nI thought the double exposure of the profile shot of the fox would work well with the bright lights of the city; to illustrate the fox looking ahead to a prosperous future as they continue to survive - in fact thrive - as they move from the countryside to the cities.\n\nThis is a 1/1 edition NFT in JPEG format (5000px x 3333px@300dpi)\n",
