    "description": "Part 2 in a 3 piece 1 of 1 mini-collection, exploring new frontiers in my personal Artistic expression while fusing the creative energies of my fellow collaborators.\n\nOver the last 12 months I have heard endless stories from so many other people who are also stepping forward into the uncharted waters of web3.\n\nNobody has to be an Island as we begin to build virtual bridges for each other. \n\n“Between the winter of our birth and the spring of our death, there is a window with a star-shaped hole. A deserted terrain, a void bridging the Universe of our experience of WHAT Colossus? Not a window but four walls and a cell. Not a hole, but a Portal passing traumas!”\n\n*This NFT Video was created using a mixture of World Creator 2, Photoshop & my personal drone images/videos. iMovie & Plotaverse apps.\n\n#nftart #ethereum #nftpoetry #nftmusic #nftvideo #thewaveartist #surfart #web3 #eth #collaboration #dune #illuvium\n \nWritten & Spoken by @artforanarchistsxo\n Music & Sound design by @Zenshynft",
