    "description": " \"In the Gray\" by Elle Vee is a hauntingly beautiful and deeply emotional song that serves as a bold new chapter in her musical journey. Drawing from her signature blend of pop and electronic sounds, Elle Vee explores the complexities of vulnerability, desire, and the struggle to find oneself amidst the uncertainty of relationships.\n\nThe song's lyrics, rich in metaphor and vivid imagery, paint a picture of an individual caught in the gray area between love and pain, unable to break free from an all-consuming connection. Elle Vee's powerful and emotive vocal performance gives life to the desperation and yearning that radiates from the trials and tribulations many of us face in the pursuit of love.\n\nCo-Produced by LA-based Grammy Award Winning Producer 'Skylar Mones'.\n",

I missed the signal \n\nLeave me for dead \nLike I already know you will\nLike I know you will \nThis is 'alive' as I’ll get \nSo I’m going in for the kill \n\nSuicide - you and I\nTell me lies, like I’ll be fine \n\nI’ll roll the dice \nTake a chance \nFeeling frozen \nHope I’m enough \nI’ll eat your words from your hands \nTo appease you \nCome have your fun \n\nLeave me for dead \nLike I already know you will\nThis is as high as I’ll get \nSo I’m going in for the kill\n\nSuicide - you and I\nTell me lies, like I’ll be fine \n\nCan I be what you need? \nI’m not invincible \nIf I said I wasn’t ready \nThen could you keep control?\nI saw the look in your eyes\nAs another animal \n\nSuicide - you and I\nTell me lies, like I’ll be fine \n\n(Stuck in the gray)",
