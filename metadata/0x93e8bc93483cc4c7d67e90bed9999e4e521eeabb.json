    "description": "\"To Infinity and Beyond\" was my first 1/1 NFT Photography collection which got SOLD OUT last year.\n\nOne year after that amazing moment in my photography career, I decided to add a fresh new photograph to the collection, but this time it's a single photograph in edition.\n\n===\n\nAbout the collection:  \n\"So many kilometers driven, so many sleepless nights, so many hours editing... This is a collection of images I created to appreciate night sky, to appreciate the pure joy of gazing into the Infinity and Beyond!\"\n\nAbout the image:  \nForeground is shot at Sunset, to get more dramatic lighting.  \nSky is shot later at dark night. The startrail is created from a single image to give the photograph unique scenery.\n\n===\n\nArtist: Asef Azi\n\nCollection: To Infinity and Beyond\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
