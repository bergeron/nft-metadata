    "description": "\n\nI was nine when I accompanied my aunt to the women’s old bathhouse, a bathhouse with cement walls and azure tiles. Aunt was carrying the newborn baby as her mother-in-law refused to take care of the baby at home. She ruined her daughter-in-law’s plan for a peaceful and complete body scrubbing bath.\nI remember the bath was the most public place you could ever see the most private things. I closed my eyes and listened to a girl’s whisper. She sang for her distant fiancé and longed for his return from military service. A bit later, the mother-in-law appeared in the bathhouse with her bath goods with a big smile. \nI held the fragile baby in my wet hands; my aunt turned over and started her bath while her song echoed in the bath steamy main hall.\n\n",
