    "description": "We live in need of electricity. In Indonesia, electricity is generated from a long process that uses coal as the main raw material. The problems that occur are many, ranging from mining that damages the environment to hazardous residues. But can I, and the rest of us, live without electricity? It seemed impossible.\n\nSometimes, as a layman, I always question, can I live in an ideal place? A utopian place where all kinds of resources can be produced without sacrificing the interests and lives of many people?",
