    "description": "Chain Witches is a reflection of the dichotomy between detachment and on-chain permanence.\n\nEach Witch is unique, created manually through a destructive process in the Game Engine that can't be replicated or saved. Similar to the mandalas of sand created by Tibetan Buddhist monks, the Witch only exists in runtime and will cease to exist after the engine stops.  \nThis means they are crafted in a state of impermanence, then captured and uploaded on-chain where they will live for eternity.  \nIn this process, lots of witches are destructed and forgotten for each one that is eternalized on-chain.\n\nWitches are free to claim, for the ones that manage to spot them.
