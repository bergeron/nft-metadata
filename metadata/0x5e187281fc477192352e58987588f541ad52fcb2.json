    "description": "In this piece, I am exploring my endless fascination with history, mysticism, and philosophy. Many discoveries made by ancient civilizations are only now being understood by modern science.\n\nDo ancient civilizations hold more knowledge of the unknown realms than we are aware of?  \n\nWhat if we are more powerful than we think, what if we could learn more from the past?\n\nI used a cloth that I brought from my travels in Egypt to create the textures and used the colour scheme of the art found in ancient tombs. The House of Ra meaning the house of God.  \n\nEmbedded with Augmented Reality \nMusic by: Jag Shival, \nPoetry & Narration by: Ola Cichy\n\nTo view Augmented Reality download the Artvive APP:\nGoogle Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artivive&hl=en&gl=US\nApple: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artivive/id1188737494",
