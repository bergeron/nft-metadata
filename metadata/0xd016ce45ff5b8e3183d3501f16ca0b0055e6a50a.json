    "description": "Here I am standing alone on a beach in the middle of the night, listening to the waves crash in front of me followed by the soft echo from the cliffs behind.\n\nI'm still yet to completely understand what it is, but there is a force that draws me to these moments, a drive to search out the stars, to seek quiet and solitude, to find and narrow my thoughts.\n\nWilliam Shatner went to space and looked into the dark expanse, on returning he said \"All I saw was death\". Our eyes don't allow us to see these beautiful colors in the dark, but when I look up my brain adds in the colors our eyes don't allow us to see. \n\nAll I see is life.",
