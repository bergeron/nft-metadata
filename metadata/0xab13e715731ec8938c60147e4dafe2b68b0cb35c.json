    "description": "One should always take out time to look around and observe how huge the world really is and how insignificant we and our problems are In front of it. This makes us worry less and be more practical towards the hurdles in our lives. However, this doesn't mean that we, the human beings, don't matter when compared to nature. After all, what's the purpose of nature if not to be discovered by the human race.\n\nCaptured at Sarfaranga Desert, Skardu. \nEdition : 1/1\nDimensions : 3200 x 2300\nCollection : Deserted Dreams",
