    "description": "Meet the Peephole mug, a custom-designed cup created especially for Geccobot and his love for hot chocolate. Its unique design features a small opening that allows you to pour your drink in, but never allows you to pour it out. \n\nWhen you peer into the opening, you'll notice a small black vortex that sucks everything inside it. To enjoy your drink, you'll need an intergalactic GEC TEC Straw that can extract the liquid from the black hole. On the bright side, you'll never have to worry about spilling your drink!",
