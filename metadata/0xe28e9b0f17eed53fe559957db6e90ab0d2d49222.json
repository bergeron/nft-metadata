    "description": "PINEAPPLE CRUSH was written on a summer's day in LA, riding the wave of a hangover and letting the ease of the sun run through me. \n\nAfter taking the uber from the party in the morning my mind was at ease and able to focus on nothing but the cars passing by. \n\nI had written the lyric  \"you came on strong like the sun on my back\"  about a week prior to going out for the night. When the day came to write PINEAPPLE with Oscar Scheller it seemed to be the perfect spine of our song. \n\nI was listening to Wild Thoughts by Rihanna and DJ Khaled pretty relentlessly so I think that was also a strong gene in this songs DNA.\n\nOscar was in the UK at the time but he know's the Cali vibe. We started and finished the whole song over facetime. The vocals were even recorded on my phone in the voice memo app and sent to him whilst we were worlds away. \n\nBlue May mixed her and had her ready for the summer ",
