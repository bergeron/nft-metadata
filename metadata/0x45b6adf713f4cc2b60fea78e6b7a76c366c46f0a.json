    "description": "When making \"The Glitch in the Past\" collection I used my own art to give \n@midjourney_ai  \n a prompt to create from. I will have them down below for example. I then have the prompt to glitch the images and give them a classic look. I wanted these images to have a presence of passion, strength, and beauty but to be altered or distorted by the presence of the glitch. I wanted this series to speak that there is no such thing as perfection. It is unattainable. So always be comfortable with who you are and always love yourself as you are. The beauty of IMPERFECTION.",
