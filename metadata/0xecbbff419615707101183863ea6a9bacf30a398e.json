    "name": "ROSALIND",
    "description": "Rosalind is a porcelain doll with long curly hair and a beautiful, yet eerie, appearance. Her red dress and matching shoes give her an old-fashioned Victorian look, and her eyes seem to follow anyone who looks at her. There is a sense of malevolence about her, with her porcelain skin feeling cold to the touch, and her facial expression contorted into a sinister grin. Her movements seem almost alive, with her head turning as if she were watching those around her. The doll's presence is always felt, even when no one is looking at her, and strange things happen when she's left alone in a room. Doors slam shut, objects move on their own, and whispers can be heard as if coming from her. Rosalind's curse is real, and she seeks revenge on anyone who crosses her path. Her legend lives on, serving as a haunting reminder of the dangers of playing with things that we don't understand.",
