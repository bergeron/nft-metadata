    "description": "The \"Who Am I\" wall of masks in this memory palace is inspired by the ideas of exploration of identity, self-perception, and personal growth. Each mask represents different facets of one's personality, experiences, and roles in life. When we find ourselves choosing a different mask on any given day, are we unveiling hidden aspects of our identity?\n\nThis piece was created with AI, as part of the latent space exploration of the Memory Palace collection."
