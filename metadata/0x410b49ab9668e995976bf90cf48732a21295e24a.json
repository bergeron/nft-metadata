    "description": "Laser art created in LaserLewDude's closet using lasers, glass, mirrors and H2O.\n\nThis piece is a 1/1 B-side from the \"Portal Assembly\" installation, air dropped to a bidder!\n\nhttps://superrare.com/0xe546bb3931059d343335b035a02fce9f9c69cee8/portal-assembly-[interactive]-5\n\nSetup details (of main shot, B-Side may differ slightly):  \n•1W Lasercube x2 coming from R+L of camera - bouncing off 1st surface mirrors that are far back R+L - reflecting inward and downward behind the centerpiece, reflecting off the mirror on the surface, and back up and outward.  \n•1W Lasercube x1 mounted above camera, reflecting downwards behind centerpiece, off surface mirror and back upward (golden beams)\n\nSingle beam modules:  \n•488nm (pretty blue) x3 going horizontally behind centerpiece  \n•638nm (red) x2 going horizontally behind centerpiece  \n•495nm (cyan) through generic star field diffraction grating for background\n\nAll mirrors are 1st surface mirrors salvaged from rear projections TVs.  \n1 4\" glass ball on large mirror (on the surface of the desk)  \n2 large (approx 12\"x12\") mirrors angled in like a teepee.\n\nHard to see, but behind the teepee is 2 other large mirrors on top of glass vases filled with water and shot glasses filled with water. 2x 1.5\" glass balls sitting in between elevated horizontal mirrors.",
