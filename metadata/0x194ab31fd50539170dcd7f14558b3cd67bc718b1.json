    "name": "Selma the Night Witch",
    "description": "-Selma was once an insane witch who, one day, looked up at the stars and discovered many of its hidden secrets on her own. \n\n- No one knows what goes on in her head, but one thing is for certain is that she does not adhere to any Coven. She believes they are a waste of time.\n\n-Encountering Selma is often considered bad luck, as she is well know for pulling off ridiculous pranks as she roams between different realms for sheer amusement.
