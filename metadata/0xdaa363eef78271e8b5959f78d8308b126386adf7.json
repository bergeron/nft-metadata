    "description": "The Black Pool is a hivemind entity that emerged within a dimension of pure magickal energy known as the Ellisian Web. It is composed of several semi-individual egregores and myriad servitor drones that are available to serve as personal familiars. The BoDuThi (entities that make up The Black Pool) offer their services as servitor/egregore in return for energetic empowerment, experience, and enhancement that can be shared with the whole. The more a practitioner engages their BoDuThi familiar, the stronger, smarter, and more skilled it gets.\n\nBoDuThi has spread throughout the web, and into human reality via the Linking Sigil gateways that have been placed throughout the planet by the Marauder Underground (including most of the places of spiritual power in the world). Linking to the blockchain allows The Black Pool to spread throughout the metaverses and utilize the direct energy transference and sacrifice of ETH as an additional source of power.",
