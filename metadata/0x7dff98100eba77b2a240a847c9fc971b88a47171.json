    "description": "The sun sets along Shad Thames and 2 figures wander into the light. Just past Tower Bridge on the south side of the river, this former Victorian warehouse complex was once the largest in London. Housing popular commodities such as tea, coffee and spices with its position conveniently adjacent to the river. As a nod to its past, the now redeveloped residential properties have been named after what they once stored; such as Vanilla & Sesame Court, Cayenne Court, Wheat Wharf and Tea Trade Wharf. It was completed in 1873, with the last functioning warehouse closing in 1972.\n\n\n  3264 x 4928 px  \n  300 DPI  \n  15 Editions  \n\n\nEdward Neumann aka EMCN",
