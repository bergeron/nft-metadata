    "description": "“Perfect Relationship” is a series of photographs created by Artem Humilevskyi and Julia Po in the time of Corona.\nThis is an artificially created universe where artists recreate real relationships by combining scenes from their lives and finding common meaning in them.\nIn fact, home life is one of the most private spheres of our being. It is the most truthful essence of human nature because when it comes to personal comfort, there is no need to hide one's real personality.\n",
