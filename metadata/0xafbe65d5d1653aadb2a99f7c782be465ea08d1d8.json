    "description": "\"The Revenge\" represents Nemesis, ancient goddess of Revenge and Punishment, guardian of the balance of the universe. \n\n\"Thee, Nemesis I call, almighty queen, \nby whom the deeds of mortal life are seen:\nEternal, much rever'd, of boundless sight, \nalone rejoicing in the just and right:\nChanging the counsels of the human breast \nfor ever various, rolling without rest.\nTo every mortal is thy influence known, \nand men beneath thy righteous bondage groan;\nFor ev'ry thought within the mind conceal'd\nis to thy fight perspicuously reveal'd.\nThe soul unwilling reason to obey \nby lawless passion rul'd, thy eyes survey.\nAll to see, hear, and rule, O pow'r divine \nwhose nature Equity contains, is thine.\nCome, blessed, holy Goddess, hear my pray'r, \nand make thy mystic's life, thy constant care:\nGive aid benignant in the needful hour, \nand strength abundant to the reas'ning pow'r;\nAnd far avert the dire, unfriendly race of counsels impious, arrogant, and base.\"\n\nOrphic Hymn to Nemesis, A Hymn",
