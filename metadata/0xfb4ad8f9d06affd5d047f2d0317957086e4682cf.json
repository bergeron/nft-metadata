    "description": "‘The Assassin’ it the first drop from my ‘A Movie Called Life’ collection. When I saw this man near the Hamburg harbour he reminded me immediarly of an agent movie. I followed him for a while till the brake lights of the passing cars added the missing light. For me, this image is a good example of how life can look like a movie sometimes.",
