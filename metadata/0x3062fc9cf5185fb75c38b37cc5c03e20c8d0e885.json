In our rush, we always forget to acknowledge you.\n\nThe idea of taking the photo came as a collabration to my own work (Poseidon, The Others & The Night Walk). \nIt was created by combining 4 photographs taken by hand at 1/4 shutter speed. As in my other works, there are no digital effects in this photograph. \nExif is available.\n\nPhotographer: Melih Taner Tanyeli  \nEdition: Limited  \nLocation: Istanbul - Turkey  \nJpeg Size: 5454x3744/300dpi\n\nLicence: Extended Editorial  \nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
