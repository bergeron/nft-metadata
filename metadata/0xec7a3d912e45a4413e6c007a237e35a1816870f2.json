    "description": "From above, the coconut palms are the first thing you notice, and the last thing you’ll forget. Entirely covered, like moss on a boulder. Unnervingly uniform and uniquely beautiful.\n\nRise early, with smoke and light. Bring them with, they’ll want to see. Today your journey takes you along the road, over the hill, to the left, and beneath the palms.\n\nClose your eyes, clear your mind, step into this moment… and you’ve arrived at the Oasis of Siargao.\n\n100% of profits (minus fees) will be verifiably donated to the people of Siargao to rebuild the homes and businesses most affected by Typhoon Odette on Dec. 16th, 2021. \n\nEach SIARGAO ISLAND collection holder will be whitelisted for the free mint of an unpublished work in 2022. Details announced via Twitter.\n\n3675 × 5093",
