    "description": "This song is about committing to being open, about allowing for the darkness *and* the light. \n\nBut this recording, this release, this is about the power of friendship and collaboration. \n\nWithout the prompt from my friend to “just write and record one quickly,” I wouldn’t have. Without Zac singing with me, Scott making the mix, and ATW designing the cover this song is just another session on my hard drive. \n\nAnd without you collecting it, it’s another bundle of bits floating by on the endless stream. Thank you for doing more than just listening. ",
