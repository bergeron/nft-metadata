    "description": "Genesis, shot in Tallinn in 2013, is a truly relevant photo because I consider it to be the seed of my Urban Geometry series, my most important project to the date. The joy of taking and processing this photo, together with the feedback I received, encouraged me to start the Urban Geometry series and, in the long run, become an architecture photographer by profession.  \nThis photo is included in my Urban Geometry book, published by Hoxton Mini Press. \n\nOngoing series Urban Geometry travels the globe to capture mesmerizing silhouettes, colorful juxtapositions and angular forms of the world’s most exciting buildings. Symmetry, lines, shadows and color: an immersive visual tour of the contemporary architecture forming the spatial soundtrack to our lives.  \n\nThese photos also serve as a journey of self development as photographer and as a person.  \n\nWidely published in media such as Der Spiegel, The Guardian, etc. Exhibited in Madrid, Seoul, Tallinn.\n\nLicensing:\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants. The license includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder. Provides no rights to create commercial merchandise, commercial distribution, or derivative works.\n\nPhotography: Andrés Gallardo Albajar  \nEdition: 1/1  \nLocation: Tallinn, Estonia  \nYear: 2013  \nCamera: Nikon D5100  \nLens: Nikon 118-105 mm  \nFocal length: 18mm  \nShutter speed: 1/500s  \nAperture: f/3.5  \nISO: 320  \nSize: 4928 × 3264",
