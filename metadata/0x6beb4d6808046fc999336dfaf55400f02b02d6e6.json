    "description": "This work explores natural repetition, symmetry and colour. It features the first FLUX Totem, highlighting the underlying tones of tribal worship present throughout my work. \n\nI created Delightful Vandalism as my Genesis Foundation drop minted on a fresh FLUX manifold contract to maintain ownership and provenance regardless of marketplaces in the future. \n\nThe title of the work is dedicated to my love of the Graffiti movement from its purest form of tagging or bombing all the way through to legal street art murals. \n\nAll 1/1 works minted on the ethereum blockchain come with utility. This enables the original owner to choose a single character to be recreated and minted as a 1/1 in the Deluxe FLUX collection.",
