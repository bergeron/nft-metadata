    "description": "Started this art on 26.05 and finished on 8.06.  Exactly 2 weeks every day of which I wanted to leave this work, but all the new victims brought me back to art. \n\nYesterday my city was hit by two rocket attacks: a supermarket and a car wash. It happened at the moment when I was finishing the last mosaics. I flinched at the explosions, but didn't stop. The desire to finish the picture became stronger than fear. A picture, the main character of which undertook to decide fate. Chechnya, Syria, Georgia, Ukraine. This list will continue if at some point we give up.\n\nBalls filled with blood symbolize 4 countries that fell victim to the bloody tyrant. The whole picture consists of many mosaics, each of which is not like the other. They symbolize lost lives. Hidden in the mosaics are dates that will respond with pain to those who fell victim to the events associated with them.\n\nYear: 2023\nDigital Art\nStyle: mosaic\nSize: 7000*10000 pixels, 132 dpi",
