    "name": "A Moment of Motion",
    "description": "Dance photography in the studio generally requires some forethought and planning: what is the dancer’s style? What mood do you want to convey? How does the motion of the body interact with the light? This photo is special to me, however, because it was just a single moment of motion in a dance that Vera Goetzee was improvising. I don’t think we could have planned this more perfectly.",
