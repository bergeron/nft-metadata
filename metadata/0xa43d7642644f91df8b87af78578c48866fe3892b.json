    "description": "Doeurm Kor Market, Phnom Penh, Cambodia is kind of a citizen's kitchen. So many people coming and going, buying and selling every single day. They are working from dark and finish working at around 7am. From above, we can see the human interactions every single spots with full of colors. We have a lot of convenient apps for shopping and delivery now a days, but what makes Phnom Penh charming is this kind of human interactions.     ",
