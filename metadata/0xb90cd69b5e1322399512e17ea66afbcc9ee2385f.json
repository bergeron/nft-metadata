    "description": "   Physical pain has certain limits. If it is too severe, the brain turns off the receptors of the nervous system transmitting the pain signal, and the person loses consciousness. There are no limits for soul pain. The sacred books of all religions say: the pain of the soul released from the body and not protected by it is boundlessâ€¦\n   However, our souls are not as helpless as they seem to be at first glance. There are things that are much stronger than our body. There are things that can cure any soul by extinguishing the most intense and boundless pain. The name of this healing elixir is love!\n...\nMusic by Sendrock\nOriginal painting by Vanches\n...\nPicture 297x420 mm. Pencil, gel pens.",
