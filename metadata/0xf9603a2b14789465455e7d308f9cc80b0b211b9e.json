    "name": "How about this suit",
    "description": "The Applicant is a small, curated collection of five images inspired by the eponymous poem by Sylvia Plath. The poem is a dramatic monologue in which a salesperson rigorously interviews a man who has applied to buy a wife. The poem satirizes rampant consumerism and patriarchy, exploring ways these forces pressure people to conform to narrow roles.\n\nThis particular photo is called 'How about this suit', a sentence from The Applicant:\n\nI notice you are stark naked.\nHow about this suit——\nBlack and stiff, but not a bad fit.\nWill you marry it?\nIt is waterproof, shatterproof, proof\nAgainst fire and bombs through the roof.\nBelieve me, they'll bury you in it.\n\nImportant note: I've created this collection in collaboration with my sister, Charlotte Bedaux, a very talented photographer and painter, who came up with the concept.",
