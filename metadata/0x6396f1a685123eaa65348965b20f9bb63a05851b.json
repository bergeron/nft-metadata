    "description": "One of my favourite images taken to date! I loved the cinematic vibe to this shot, coupled with that moody, solitary feel, it really makes for a moment I won't forget.\n\n\"Who was this mystery man?\" I asked myself. A jazz musician leaving his set for the evening? A snappily dressed throwback to smarter times, standing apart from those around him? I would always wonder...or so I thought!\n\nEmmett's niece happened to spot him in a street photography group I posted in and he got in touch to say he loved the shot! I couldn't believe it! A photographer himself (even had a camera in the bag he was holding), he and his family have a long history with street photography, so was such an honour to be able to share this candid moment with them.",
