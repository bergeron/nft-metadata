    "description": "The night is dark and full of terrors! The terminal is empty or so it seems… The corridor seems long to cross. What may be lurking shall be revealed…\n\nThis piece depicts every right or wrong path I chose in life and got me where I am today. Everything happens for a reason, they say… Hope I opened the right door and entered the reality I was supposed to enter. Have I landed in a dystopian present? Are we inside a simulated reality? Time will tell, as we are all here to witness how things will evolve.\n\nAll the choices I’ve made, define who I am today. I don’t regret any of the choices I’ve made as I would haven’t done anything differently.\n\nArtist: Dimitris Fatisis\n\nCollection: Editions x Teexels\n\nEdition: Limited to 30\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
