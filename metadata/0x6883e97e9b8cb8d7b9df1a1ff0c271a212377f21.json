    "description": "About ETHernal Series:  \nThe ETHernal Series is a visual representation of coined words where a select syllable is substituted with “ETH”.\n\nAbout catETHdral:  \nThis is a work of art that is inspired by the architecture of Roman Catholic churches, specifically the dome and the structure's pillars. \n\nIn this piece, I intended to project a 3-dimensional dome onto a 2-dimensional surface while maintaining the aesthetics of perspective, details, and precision.\n\nThe primary collector of this NFT is entitled to the signed, original work measuring 20” x 23\". It is their property, whether or not they are ready to receive the physical work.",
