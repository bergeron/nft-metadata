    "description": "8888 x 5000 px JPG Rendered entirely in Cinema4d and Arnold\n\nA view from a red mountainous landscape, on a satellite belonging to the planet above. The sky-dome observed is light, possibly due to atmospheric presence. The planet is an Earth-like atmospheric globe, with a mantle, presence of water, and potentially oxygen and nitrogen. The mother star is single, and Sun-like in appearance.\n\n~\n\nEach planetscape is an experiment and a journey of discovery. Textures are procedurally generated within the rendering program. Beautiful and complex results are achieved through fine layering of effects. I also make use of volumes, a key feature of Arnold rendering engine. It allows me to create subtle and stunning atmospheres and effects on the surface of the planets and on the entire landscape viewpoint.\n\nUsing a simple formula of foreground, planet, and background, I endeavor to create immersive and unique worlds, each one a different experience - akin to an astronautâ€™s journey into cosmos.",
