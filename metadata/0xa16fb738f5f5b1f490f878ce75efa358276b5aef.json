    "description": "Inspired by the Year of the Water Tiger (2022).\n\nAs someone who grew up celebrating Chinese New Year, I feel compelled to design a piece inspired by it.\n\nThe color palette is inspired by Chinese culture; red for good fortune and gold for wealth.\n\nThe composition is a nod to Hu Zaobin and how he pairs tigers with nature in his paintings.\n\nThe waterfall symbolizes the element of 2022. Because tigers symbolize strength and water symbolizes flow and open-mindedness, the year of the water tiger will bring about growth, challenges, endurance, and creation.\n\nThe year of the water tiger occurs once every 60 years.\n\n---\n\nThe owner of this piece will be able to get digitally dressed in it 2x a year, for life.",
