    "description": "My work suggests possibilities of interlocution that go beyond the presentational register. The images portrayed explore the two- and three-dimensional limits, proposing a new look at the visual references of contemporary scenarios. The work articulates new meanings to the forms that are sustained by the meanings contained in themselves. In the quest to share a way of looking, I create visualities that simultaneously explore possibilities and impossibilities of happening, occupation and emptiness, noise and silence, satisfaction and search. In the relationship with the world, creating and reproducing are possibilities of the same experience. The creation of new meanings encourages the construction of the new while destabilizing, since, by resignifying what exists, familiarity with what is known is lost. The images denounce the yearning for the still unknown and cry out for the creation of new meanings, a movement that arises in instability and is common to all men.",
