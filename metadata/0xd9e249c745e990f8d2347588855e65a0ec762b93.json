    "description": "RememberZombie monkey is a collection of hand-drawn pictures that will soon turn into NFT, each of my works is unique, you will NOT see automatic generation and the same type of pictures from the Internet, I have different styles and different genres but with the same meaning. I have been painting almost all my life and for some unknown reason I have been painting monkeys for more than ten years. Each element is drawn with brush and ink and oil, then scanned and digitally colored.",
