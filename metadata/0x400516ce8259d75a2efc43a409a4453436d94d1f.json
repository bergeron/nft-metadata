    "description": "The Desert Oasis is a fun beautiful photo taken in the small ghost town of Nelson Nevada!\n\n The West is filled with rich history and rustic vibes like this! Growing up and traveling around the small towns in the west I began to grow a huge passion towards things like old Neon Motel Signs, Old Historical Brick/Wooden buildings and best of all Rusted Classic Cars that you know back in the day absolutely dominated the open road!\n\n My hope with this piece is that you enjoy and find beauty in old and vintage vibes like I do.",
