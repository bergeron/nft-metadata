    "description": "Is a woman an invisible decoration? Is a woman a shadow? Is a woman a ghost through which one can see the environment? \n\nI hold admiration for many things in the world; beauty, architecture, art, and culture. This series focuses on the reflection of painted tiles and mirror mosaics with the beauty of people. \n\n \n\nI created these works in support of the women of Iran, who can no longer tolerate their unequal treatment. I wanted to show that a woman is not a shadow that blends into the wall. Perhaps my knowledge is not enough to fully feel all the pain, the whole culture of the Iranian people, but I feel their pain of injustice. And as I could, I expressed it through creativity.",
