    "description": "# *The Calder Question* - Season 1\n\nCalder Foundation and TRLab have joined forces with two-time Emmy® Award-winning motion designer Raoul Marks to create 5 limited edition NFT artworks for Season 1 of The Calder Question based on these 5 Calder mobiles:\n\n\\- Vertical Foliage, 1941\n\n\\- Eucalyptus, 1940\n\n\\- Snow Flurry, 1948\n\n\\- Tines, 1943\n\n\\- Untitled, 1956\n\nRaoul Marks: \"*Eucalyptus* instantly drew me to the esoteric curves of its numerous forms, in particular the lowermost element. Exploring the wake of this element as it moves through a void suggested grand arcs on a cosmic scale. Trying to capture the space carved out by its motion served as the backbone for this work. There’s also a delicate interplay of the staggered spears in the upper quadrant of *Eucalyptus*—the way they echo each other suggested a single element observed over time. I’m always intrigued by how Calder’s work seems to bend space. For me, trying to capture a version of that distortion of perception was key in translating how this work made me feel.\"",
