    "description": "Go deep, deep into the night, where space and time dissolve the human consciousness.\n\n\nCaptured up a secret and remote New Zealand valley; where the magic happens. Tales are told around campfires and reality becomes distorted.\n\n\nAn audio snippet from Truth, an electronic music duo from Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\nAn airdrop for collectors of my first edition \"Diffused\"  \nThank you all so much!  \nEdition #2 coming soon.\n\nAbout me  \nI'm Paul Wilson, an Astrophotographer from New Zealand. \nI picked up my first camera in 2014 and have never looked back. \nSelf-taught and constantly pushing the limitless creative potential of photography, always in search of the next shot. I'm happy to have made so many friends through photography, won awards, worked with amazing companies, and captured the universe around us.\n\nName of Collection Clip: Star Masters\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, and display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
