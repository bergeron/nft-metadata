    "description": "This image is from our failed ICO launch in which only the developers invested, two months later refunded when the ICO ended.  No one else invested cause we had only 3 people in our channel and highly skeptical from the long bear market.  Contract address is here. 0x525BAC39Eb5DbAAE3E46E1232f41B9F52A36DeC8  . Now we are growing a strong community and hope to have our subscribers become our angel investors.  This is priced much higher because it a time capsule to the hopes, dreams, and far cries of launching an ICO from our bedrooms which we still code and help our community from.  This NFT can make the hold feel like that went back into time and invested in the project’s ICO launched in Oct 27, 2020 and refunded date of Dec 9, 2020.   We think this awesome iconic ICO image that most likely will be more appreciated later down the years.  Hope you appreciate the cool NFT.
