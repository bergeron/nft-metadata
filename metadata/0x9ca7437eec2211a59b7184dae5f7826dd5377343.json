    "description": "In 1977, the Voyager 1 & Voyager 2 probes were sent on unmanned interstellar trips. Onboard each of these was a Golden Record, a collection of primarily images and sounds, intended to portray what life on earth was like to an extraterrestrial life form that may someday find them. \nThe Stone had the same purpose for the Symmerians. As their society was on the verge of self-destruction, a team created The Stone. In doing so, they immortalized ten of the digital worlds in which they inhabited, in hopes that one day, maybe someone could come along who was able to decipher The Stone and unlock these worlds that they treasured so much. They also used The Stone as a way to send a warning to the people that discover it, in hopes that we do not suffer the same fate.",
