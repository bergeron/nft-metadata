    "description": "My work is first and foremost an attempt to translate the Old Masters aesthetic to the means of expression of digital photography. \n\nThis type of imagery is quintessential for my work and style.\nAt the end of the day, my images are about who I am, more than anything else. Products of my imagination, experience, memories and emotions.\n\nImage part of Claudiu Guraliuc internationally published, multiple award winning, baroque inspired series. "
