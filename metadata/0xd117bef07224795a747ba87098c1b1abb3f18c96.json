    "description": "The Puche is a creature of silence and solitude, its existence delicately entwined with the murmuring leaves and whispering winds of its home. With a sensitive sense of hearing, it listens to the songs of the wild, each rustle, each breath of the wind, each faint forest sound is within its grasp. Their veins carry an ancient legacyâ€”a miraculous healing blood, revered and integrated into the healing traditions of the native tribes. Yet, with such rare magnificence comes a haunting vulnerability. The Puche, captivating and mysterious, stand on the precipice of extinction, threatened by the encroaching human expansion and hunting.\n\n/Karina Boissonnier, Digital Painting, 2023 ",
