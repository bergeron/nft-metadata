    "description": "the Calendar Card for the month of June, 2023.\n\nI made this piece by overlaying three photographs of a rose bouquet in photoshop. Each photo was taken a week apart and showcases the wilting process. You can see the vibrant red from the first photo and the sullen pinks and drab greens/yellows from the end of the lifespan.\n\nphotos were taken using ICM technique w/ minimal editing.\n\nI love the unique vibrancies in each of the stages, but I especially love how they came together to create a bit of a watercolor effect; a cacophony of colors and shapes depicting just how fast life can change.\n\nI lost my father toward the end of last year and I was thinking of him when making this piece. We had a tumultuous relationship which ended abruptly leaving some harsh unresolved feelings. Itâ€™s what I see when I view the piece, but it also allows for a rorschach-like test.\n\nSo, what do you see?",
