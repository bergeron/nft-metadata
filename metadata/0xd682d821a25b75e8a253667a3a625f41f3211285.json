    "description": "The first tree times i went to Iceland and visited the \nFamous Skógafoss Waterfall i was absolutely amazed, but the fourth time i had promised my self that i would look deeper and go my own way to discover some now wonders of Iceland and Little did I know that I just had to look to the left to find this beautiful shot. \n\nSometimes you really can't see the woods for the trees but do you self a favor and the next time you see a lot of people looking or taking pictures in one direction take a step back and turn around and see what they are missing, sometimes there's a hidden shot to be taken and sometimes there's a good opportunity to find a good cup of coffee.\n\nIceland (N 63° 31' 46.9992\", W 19° 30' 50.0004\")",
