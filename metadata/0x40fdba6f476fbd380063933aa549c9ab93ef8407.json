    "description": "The first NFT of the Tokyo Streets Collection.  This is one of my favorite images and as such holds a special place in my heart.  There is a half hidden reason this photo means a lot to me.  My friends, Hiroshi, Kiyoto, Yuki and I had drinks at multiple Izakaya's with Yakitori and good times.   The smell of smoke in the air and laugher will always be present when out in the Tokyo night scene.  The Japanese like to smoke while chatting it up and snacking on freshly cooked chicken on a stick with onion and sometimes, gizzards.  We met people who liked talking to the Gaijin from California, and as the night progresses you leave one location only to attempt to find the next spot to hang out in.  You will walk through beautiful grungy alleyways filled with the smell of Ramen, Seafood and conversation.  And as we walked to our car I pulled out my camera and saw this shop near the outskirts of Kichijoji.  A man inside saw I was about to take a photo and left me a beautiful gift.  Arigatou....",
