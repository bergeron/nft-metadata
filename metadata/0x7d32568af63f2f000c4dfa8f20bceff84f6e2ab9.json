    "description": " \nThis collection of original paintings titled “Personas”explores a cardinal theme that comes up continuously in all of our lives: making order out of chaos. \n\nEach painting was made using the meditative process of tuning everything out except for what’s right in front of me, or rather, what’s springing from within my heart, if my heart could be located at the soles of my feet, which is where I feel each work of art begin to move me into action. Truly, all of the brushwork in my paintings is the end of a line that started from the ground up, darted through my electrical bio system, off of my finger tips, onto the picture plane, and then off again, headed into the ether. \n\nIn fact some part of the art actually does jump off of the painting into the ether, in the case of the vibration generated by the color. That input is projected through the air and thus diffused to all bio receptors nearby.\n",
