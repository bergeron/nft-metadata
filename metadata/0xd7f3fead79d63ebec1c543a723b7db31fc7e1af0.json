    "description": "The Crown features Chapter 1 of \"A Quiet World\", depicted in digital vector illustrations.\n\nReginald follows the same routine every sunrise, reading the Non Fudable, while anxiously learning about the various digital opportunities that await him. As seen from his crown... (which he is never seen without), Reginald is a royal tree kangaroo, who is always looking for the next big swing. Although the \"Roos\" see their humble village as a satisfactory living situation, Reginald sees it differently. \n\nTo put it simply, he is too ambitious for his quiet village. He looks to bring others around him to the digital lands, to achieve his dreams of ruling other ecosystems. \n\nReginald, wants to go to the moon.",
