    "description": "Light and shadow are the two invisibles that make up everything we see. I wanted to tell the sharp story of light and shadow with lines. This magnificent duo, which is the basic element of art, creates unique works when used correctly. This collection is full of tradition and I hope it will delight you as much as it pleases me. This collection is for those who are conscious and ready to discover something new, each art is unique in its own way and will be a great addition to your collection. My aim is to draw attention to water, which is our source of life, and the importance of using it correctly. 10% of my sold works will be sent as GREENPEACE Donation. I will share my donation receipts on my social media account, now you can buy and contribute to protect our nature. After purchasing my works, you can request a high resolution version by contacting my social media accounts. Now I present to you my work in line with this story.",
