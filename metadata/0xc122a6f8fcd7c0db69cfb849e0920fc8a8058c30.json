    "description": "A sequential capture of the super-moon's rise over Kenya's capital city of Nairobi, December 2017. \n\nNairobi, Kenya is on the equator; that does explain why the moon rise is perpendicular to the horizon. \nOn this particular evening, it was a selenelion. A selenelion occurs when the sun and moon are 180 degrees apart in the sky at the same time. The moon was rising at the same time the sun was setting, hence the blue hour sky. \nAnother beautiful natural phenomenon is the color change of the moon as it rises. This effect is caused by the atmosphere of the earth. The reason for the red to orange color is due to the scattering of the light by the atmosphere. When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead.",
