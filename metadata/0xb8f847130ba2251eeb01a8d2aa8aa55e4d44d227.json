    "description": "Happy International Women's Day, peeps!\n\nI drew Betty, the amazing founder of Deadfellaz! She's such an inspiration to all of us girls out there, and I was so hyped to create this piece for the 'Deadfellaz: Draw The Undead '22' art competition. And guess what? My work got chosen as one of the winners in the Top 30! Woohoo!\n\nAnd wait, there's more! My artwork is going to be showcased in 'The Women in Tech 2023' virtual gallery on March 8! I'm so proud to be a part of this event and to represent young artists like myself. \n\nI'm totally stoked to preserve this memory by registering it on the blockchain. \n\nI just want to say a huge THANK YOU to Betty for being such an inspiration to women and young artists in the creative industry. You're the best, Betty!\n\n1/1 Digital Artwork\nSize - 8000px x 8000px\nMedium - Procreate app & iPad Pro",
