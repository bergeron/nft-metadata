    "description": "I dreamed of this image.  \nI can't tell if I was asleep or awake, but I longed to feel the true color my eyes saw when they closed.  \nI needed to understand the meaning of all that blood circulating in my veins.  \nI needed to represent this in an image while I'm feeling alive, will I be seeing life in full when I find the meaning of all this color when I close my eyelids.  \nI hope to find all the sense I lack before they finish their work, before all this color, this color of blood, runs out.\n\nBlood 2/2/2022.\n\n- The winner of the auction will received the piece in acrylic frame and manuscript on tissue paper.\n",
