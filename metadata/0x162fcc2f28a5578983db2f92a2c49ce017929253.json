    "description": "View from the top floor is the first installation of the “It Will All Make Sense In Retrospect (V1)”, 5 part Edition Series \n\nIt introduces the character Midnight for the first time in my universe (this version of her) and tells the story from a different perspective, from the other side of adversity, \"the journey\", the past and Right Now. This Series is the first to take the perspective of the Future Tense.\n\nThe cityscape itself is made up of over 1000 tiny hand drawn blocks to illustrate that a dream is built brick by brick. \nWhen you zoom in, what you’re looking at may not make sense but once you zoom out the vision is perfectly clear -- it's depiction, the illustration and the story as a whole, made to represent me in that sense.\n\nWelcome to the World of Prophecy, \nThis is Midnight's Journey.\n\n",
