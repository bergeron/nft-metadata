    "description": "The inspiration for \"Tidal Dreams\" comes from Resaang's personal experiences walking up the shoreline in Phuket between her hard training days in MuayThai. Inspired by the ocean and its tides during those quiet mornings and late afternoons. The piece is depicted by gentle ripples, with a few larger ones crashing against the shore. The water is a deep blue, with hints of green and turquoise. The piece is meant to encourage feelings of peace and tranquility in midst of change.",
