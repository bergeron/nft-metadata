    "name": "Typhon",
    "description": "She was originally imprisoned by the Gods under Wusao Mountain, but she is released by the third and final Telkine, who wields the Sickle of Kronos. She then travels to the top of Mount Olympus to seek revenge on the gods that imprisoned him. She is the mother of the Chimera, Cerberus, the Lernean Hydra and Orthus. Typhon is classified as a Titan, but in Greek mythology she is not a Titan, but simply a monster.",
