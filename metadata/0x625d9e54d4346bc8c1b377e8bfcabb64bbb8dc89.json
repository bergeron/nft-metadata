    "description": "The deities that constantly haunt my mind. In silence the biggest voices are only heard by me. In loudness, I fear that nobody sees them. I am haunted by a shadow that cannot be seen or heard but I. Maybe in death, peace will come and the sun will treat me fair. For now, the sun casts a long shadow over my head--will I ever get to see the light in day?",
