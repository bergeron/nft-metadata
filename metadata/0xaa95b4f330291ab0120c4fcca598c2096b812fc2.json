    "description": "It is the beginning of a new era for Franksy... starting by minting an open edition of my first ever painting done in 2015 called ‘Cash Is Dead’.\n\nThe original work is mixed media on canvas, donning the iconic Frank Wilder motif; created with authentic U.S. legal tender, aerosol paint and epoxy resin.\n\nThe digital recreation of this work represents the idea of exchange, culture and creativity going digital.\n\nEach edition minted of ‘Cash is Dead’ will act as a unit of exchange, where one or more editions will be burned for in exchange for future cultural experiences and creative endeavours created by yours truly. \n\nStay wild, stay free.\n\nFrank",
