    "description": "The office at the Homestead Motel.\n\nThis piece is part of my \"No Vacancy\" body of work and was awarded a finalist position at Focus LA/Photo LA in 2016.\n\nThe \"No Vacancy\" collection was born out of the contradictory obsession for the unknown tangled with a yearning for a feeling of home, a fascination for Americana vernacular, and a keenness for the mundane. It takes a look at the impersonal, anonymous, and sometimes bleak motel rooms we temporarily call home. \n\nAlthough this piece is an integral part of the larger body of work, it stands alone here as it does not depict a motel room but rather the gateway to these temporary abodes.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
