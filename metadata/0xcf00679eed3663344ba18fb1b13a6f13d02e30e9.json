    "description": "I grew up in a place where mothers commonly tell their daughters that loving their husbands truly and deeply is a foolish thing to do because when their husbands eventually start cheating, they will be heartbroken and if care is not taken, they could hurt themselves.\n\n'When you do that, he will move on with another woman,' she is told.\n\nI heard this several times when I was growing up. And for a very long time, I prepared myself mentally for this.\nNow, I am an adult and this teaching, this very thing I accepted as a child as what should be, is now to me, total Nonsense. I am a human being. I have emotions that should be respected. I am unlearning a lot of things now. This is one of them.",
