    "name": "The Last Human Mother and Baby",
    "description": "Under the cover of the dense jungle vegetation a mother watches over her infant son. A panther stands by awaiting the moment when it can throw Itself on them, while birds of prey are watching from the lush trees. In the background the sun goes down. In our world where humanity has reached the climax of its evolution in its ability of self-destruction, the intimate scene is a visualization of what will happen if someone powerful resorts to this opportunity. Beliaeva imagines what will remain of humankind if reason loses the battle to primeval aggression, questioning man’s idea of eternity in today’s globalized but fragile world. History will go back to its starting point and only the instincts will remain. It is the way it was seen by “naive” painter Henri Rousseau, whose painting The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope (1905) is reinterpreted in the animated jungle scene.",
