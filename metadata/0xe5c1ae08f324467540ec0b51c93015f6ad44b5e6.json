    "description": "the mystique of the lighthouses on the north american coastline are well documented. bass harbor head light being the pinnacle of these structures.\n\ni've shot this particular composition thousands of times without achieving the glow depicted here. right before the winter cycle takes hold paired with the angle of the sun, i was able to achieve my goal.\n\nthe northeast of america is known for the ever changing weather and temperature. the orientation, in the southeast of the island, of bass harbor head light affords the opportunity for the image i had envisioned. \n\nthis image is dedicated to those that have been shooting the same composition over and over again trying to get the perfect photo. patience is a virtue.\n\na print is available after purchase upon request\n\nthank you ",
