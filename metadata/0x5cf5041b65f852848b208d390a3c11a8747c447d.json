    "description": "Elephants donâ€™t have paws, claws, or hooves; they have feet like humans. A soft fatty pad of connective tissue forms the sole, allowing the jumbo to tread on the tip of its toes. This thick pad supports their colossal weight and dulls the sound of their footsteps so they can roam almost silently. Every foot has a unique pattern like fingerprints, and the nails are composed of Keratin, just like humans.",
