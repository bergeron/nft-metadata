    "description": "The shoot was scheduled for sunset. But model Nastya was late, and we missed the necessary twilight light. At such moments, I try not to get upset, but to use the situation. As a result, we decided not to cancel the shooting, but to wait for the dawn. After a few hours of sleep, in the morning we returned to the location. There were no people at all and the light was very good. A two-hour sleep created the feeling that we were returning in the morning after a party. I am very grateful that everything turned out this way, and that I was able to capture this magical moment forever in photography.",
