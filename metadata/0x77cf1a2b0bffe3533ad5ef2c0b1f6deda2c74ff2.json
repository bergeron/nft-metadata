    "description": "It's going to rain soon, so the sand clover is opening its petals. the clover is tired and thirsty; it is waiting for at least one drop of rain in this rainless/arid desert.\n/\nThe patterns on the lass are “Armor of flowers”—visualization of the pataphysical aura. Each of us has the Armor of flowers, it protects and guards us as if our nervous system were an aura. The Armor can give new skills or hide us behind its spikes from the cruel world.\n/\nI get these patterns generatively and manually. I scan technical illustrations from the botanical atlas and transform them into symmetrical 3D ornament using (modern) technology.\n/\npng\n/\n4500x4950px",
