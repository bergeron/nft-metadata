    "description": "\nAn artwork inspired from Instagram logo, the app which always listen, curate products and even suggest friends for us. \n\nA world where we are always seen and heard, but still trying hard to be understood!\n\nThis is an artistic take to understand the whole existence of 'love' & 'like's in social media. No one's self worth is based on the likes or followers they get on social media. The 'like' button is just a feature to trigger the reward system of your brain! \n\nThese features in media, with or without knowing bring in a sense of inadequacy about your life or appearance. While scrolling through others life, these slowly crawl into the lives as anxiety and depression. This is a world, where your social connections in digital platforms has more value but also fails to have real in-person connections with ones near you. Again, bringing in more anxiety inducing scenarios for a person. \n\nWell, our minds matter and mental health matters & may you gather the strength to practice it!\n",
