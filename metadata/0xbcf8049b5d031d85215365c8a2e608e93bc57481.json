    "description": "One day I got into a taxi, by the way, all the passengers were men. On the way, a beautiful lady passed by and one of the passengers started talking about her body... the second one and the driver started talking and judging and talking nonsense about other women's body...\n\nAt that moment, I said to myself, if they were women, would they be willing to hear such nonsense about themselves! Could they tolerate someone seeing them as a piece of delicious meat!!\n\nFinally, when I got home, the first thing I did was draw all my words on paper to calm down\nI am not a feminist , but really, extreme patriarchy is so disgusting",
