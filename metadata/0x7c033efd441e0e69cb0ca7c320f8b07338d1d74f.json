    "description": "one of my favorite memories in Barcelona was the day i stumbled upon MACBA (el Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo de Barcelona). it is regarded as a skating mecca by many around the world, and regardless of whether or not you skate, you're bound to be drawn to this cultural landmark.\n\ni was fascinated by the amount of people partaking in the scene. individuals from all walks of life were present. these folks came from every corner of the earth, but they spoke a common language; and i don't mean one that is spoken by tongue.\n\nthe calls & the falls, the celebrations & abrasions, what a moment it was to see a trick and say \"that's sick.\"\n\nno pictures please, just enjoy the moment.
