    "description": "\"Heated thoughts thirst for the cold touches of logic and the relentless details.\"\n\n(This collection metaphorically compares the emotional states we reach in two different but similar situations)Here you see a character drinking bloodily. We see how he quickly takes water or any drink to get rid of that heat and puts it in his mouthâ€¦ drink, body, or physical action are metaphors here. this physical act compares the emotion and quest we feel to rationalize situations that we think about over and over and are unable to get out of. The character conveys the pleasure we reach and the path to it with a different but similar feeling.\n\n\nThe physical work will be sent to the nft owner.\nPhsically Dimensions: 35x50 cm\n\n\nA high resolution download link will also be provided.\n\n",
