    "description": "When I write music, I like to tell a story. I don't go through enough in my life to write songs that pertain to me so I usually draw inspiration from outside sources.\n\nThe concept of \"Get Involved\" came to me when I was listening to love songs about cheating but they were always either \"breakup songs\" or \"take me back\" songs. \n\nI wanted to write a song about how the cheating went down and what transpired through it all. What was going on through this characters mind as it was happening. Hopefully none of you guys can relate haha!\n\nHope you like it!",
