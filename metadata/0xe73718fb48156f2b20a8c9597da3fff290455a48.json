    "description": "The sights, the sounds, the smells...there's really nothing quite like Summer in Brooklyn. This man passed me without a care in the world, his tiny boombox blasting not just sound, but pure energy into the air. When I asked for a photo, he stepped right into frame for exactly one shot, and then out of my life forever. Man, I love New York.\n\nCamera: Contax G2\n\n1/1",
