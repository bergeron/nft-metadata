    "description": "MAGRIB Jewelry Collection is a physically produced jewelry in urban ethnic style enhanced with one-of-a-kind videoart for each piece.\n\nThe —Åollection was inspired by the character of the mysterious powerful sorcerer from the old Arabic fairytales and the traditional ethnic jewelry of the African Tuareg nomad tribe.\n\nWhile developing this collection, I imagined how the magic amulets of a sorcerer living in a modern metropolis could look like and how do they work. These ideas are reflected in the video art that is the digital part of the jewelry.\n\nEach NFT contains one of a kind video art. The first buyer of NFT receives a physically produced in sterling silver piece of jewelry of their choice free of charge. With each subsequent resale NFT video art gives its new owner the right to order a physical jewelry with a 10% discount.\n\nAll jewelry is available at https://alluqiera.xyz\n\nVideo art Anna Nazaretskaia\nPhoto Vera Salnitskaya\nModel Alexander Drakon\nJewelry design Alluqiera\n",
