    "description": "What if I told you that five years from now you would end up going down a path that you would never have dreamed of being possible?\n\nWhen I left Germany six months ago, I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I'm driving along the west coast of the US living the van life. \n\nEven so, the last few months have been full of ups and downs. So naturally, I’ve been asking myself questions like “What really fulfills me?”, “What truly makes me happy?” and “Where do I see myself in the future?”\n\nFrom that, what I've learned along the way is that even when nothing goes the way you thought it would, there's always a reason for it, and you grow as a person from every experience.\n\nPhotography has always been my answer to those questions I’ve been asking, and it’s what has led me to where I am today.\n\n'Beginning' is the first piece in my collection named 'Tales from the Road', which takes people both visually and emotionally on perhaps what is my greatest adventure.\n\nMount Tamalpais, San Francisco",
