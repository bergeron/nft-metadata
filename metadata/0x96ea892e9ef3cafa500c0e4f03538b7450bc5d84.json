    "description": "i’d like to think that the meaning of life lies in repetition. in perpetuity.\n\nit is never about finding one’s purpose, meaning, and value. it is about constantly reminding myself the meaning behind what I do and how much value that gives me and how much of a ripple i can create.\n\nit is never about finding a person, or community, i resonate with. it is about constantly reminding myself what brought us together to begin with.\n\nwhether we create ripples, or tides in this world or ours, i believe the beauty of it lies in the steady, consistent assignment of meaning, not in the sudden discovery of it.",
