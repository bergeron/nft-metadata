    "description": "My first piece on SuperRare, minted to my own SR contract for 1/1 work.\n\nThis photo was the first time I viewed my city in a truly unique and dreamlike way. I was forever consumed by this type of imagery, and it’s a theme that’s played into a lot of my work ever since.\n\nThe title of this piece relates to where I was in my career at the time, as this was the first photo I shared that got any real attention from my peers and set in motion a creative path I still follow to this day. It seemed fitting to cement this memory on the blockchain to live forever.\n\n",
