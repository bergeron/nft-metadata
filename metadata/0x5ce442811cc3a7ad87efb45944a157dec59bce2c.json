    "name": "The mask of Chhau",
    "description": "A Chhau dancer awaits his turn to put on the intricately decorated & handcrafted mask before a performance on stage.\n\nMasks are an integral part of the Chhau dance, a semi classical Indian dance with martial & folk traditions, originating from the Rarh region of Bengal in India. The themes for these dances include local legends, folklore & episodes from the Ramayana & Mahabharata.\n\nThe dancers wear the earthy & theatrical masks hand crafted by the artist from the Sutradhar community.\n\nThe process of making the mask is a tedious & elaborate one. The facial features are made of clay. A special layer of mud & cloth is applied & the mask is then sun-dried. After this, the mould is polished again sun dried before separating the layers of cloth & paper from the mould. After finishing, holes for the nose & eyes are drilled; & then colored / decorated accordingly to represent the mythological characters from the folklore.\n\n\nSize - 6000 x 3997 pixels / 31.9mb\nResolution - 300 dpi\nFormat - Jpg",
