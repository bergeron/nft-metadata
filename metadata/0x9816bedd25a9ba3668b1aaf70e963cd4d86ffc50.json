    "description": "Sitting together at the ocean’s edge in July 2015, I noticed Pepper simply gazing into the sunset with no apparent worries and no rush to do anything more exciting, and I suddenly wondered… Do dogs enjoy looking at pretty scenery, too?  Do our fellow companions contemplate the beauty of their surroundings?  Do they feel the contentment of simply being in a magical moment, watching the light soften as the sun sinks over the horizon?  Why, yes, I think they do.\nI actually snapped this image on my phone to commemorate the moment (and edited it in Adobe Lightroom later).  Since then, I frequently notice Pepper gazing dreamily into the majesty of nature’s scenery, and it reminds me to slow my mind and do the same.",
