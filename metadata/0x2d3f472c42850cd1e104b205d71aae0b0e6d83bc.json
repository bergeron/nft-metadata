    "description": "In the promising universe of web3, what emotional language do we feel and transmit in turn? \n\nThis video is a cathartic breath illustrating the multiple portraits of ourselves that we keep inside, and don't always want to show. It's not about extreme emotion, it's about the complexity of our identities that we forget to share.\n\nThis triptych is composed of fragments and samples of emotions from films created long before web3, is a bottle in the sea, to remind us of who we are.\n\nThis video has been made with the fragmens of the following films : \n\n- Poverty in Rural America,  1965, U.S. Department of Agriculture  \n- Joseph Sargent, Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring, 1971, Metromedia Productions \n- David Wark Griffith, The Avenging Conscience, 1914  \n- Benjamin Christensen, Häxan: Witchcraft Through The Ages, 1922  \n- Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin, 1925.  \n- Louis J. Gasnier, Reefer Madness, 1938  \n- Ted Steeg Productions, Coffee House Rendezvous, 1966, Library of Congress \n- Herk Harvey, Carnival of Souls, 1962  \n- National Film Preservation Foundation, Mental Hospital, 1953  \n- National Archives and Records Administration, The Photographer, 1948  \n- Francis Thompson, Time is Life, 1949,  American Cancer Society \t\n- National Archives and Records Administration, Marijuana, ca. 1967 - ca. 1973, Department of Defense.
