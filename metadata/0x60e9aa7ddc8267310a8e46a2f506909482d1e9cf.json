    "description": "Following on from Joyful Resistance Part I, Part II delivers a rolling, jazz-fusion whirlwind, lifting the tempo from Part I's moody head-nod to a 3/4 electro-samba groove, laced with piano and moog solos, giving way to lush synths taking us from extrospection to introspection... Part II brings the celebration of \"joy as an act of resistance\" (Toi Dericotte) to the fore. Celebrating how music moves us, inspires, elevates and empowers us. Creativity as a reflection of the human experience and possibilities. Music as an inspiration for us all to contribute and create proactively, to bring about change for the greater good. \n\ncreated, performed, programmed + produced by Mark de Clive-Lowe\na mashibeats midnight snack\n\n--\n\nwelcome to our sixth of 8 drops (!) for [$BUYBACK Emerald] with Mashibeats - the web3 music-creator community I founded. We're taking this opportunity to invite you as a music NFT collector, to be part of our community.\n\nThere's two goals in mind for [$BUYBACK Emerald]. \n\nGOAL 1: increase governance membership of Mashibeats \n\n- every collector of this NFT can claim an airdrop of 60 $BUYBACK, representing governance in Mashibeats\n\nGOAL 2: building the community treasury which $BUYBACK holders have voting power over\n\n- 70% of funds from this drop go directly to the Mashibeats treasury. Over the 8 drops we aim to raise around 5 ETH, to then have community join in making proposals for $BUYBACK holders to vote on. \n\nHolders also curate and A&R by way of voting - our recently released remix contest winners vinyl and NFTs having been all decided by $BUYBACK members - curation by community ❤️ \n\nAfter collecting (thank you! and welcome!), head over to http://mashibeats.xyz/buyback\n\nHeadsup - each subsequent drop in this series of 8 will be a smaller edition batch, with a +0.01 increase in price and an increase in $BUYBACK claimable. And we're working on something special for collectors who collect all 8 of the drops !",
