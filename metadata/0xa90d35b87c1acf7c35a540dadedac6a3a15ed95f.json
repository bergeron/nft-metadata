    "description": "Living as a child is usually brightest and happiest experience and memories for all of us. But what if this harmony shattered by a bloodthirsty Kremlin tyrant? What if your family is murdered because of “russkyi mir” and your home is destroyed by the enemies of your country? \n\nOfficially more than 100 children were murdered since the beginning of Russia-Ukrainian war. And this number will only grow in nearest future. But we can help them together - and return theirs shattered future at some point. \n\nAll funds from this NFT will be delivered to the Ukrainian childcare organizations. Please help us, help our future, help those poor souls.",
