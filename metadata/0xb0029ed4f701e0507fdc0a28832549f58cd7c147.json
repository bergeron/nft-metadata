    "description": "This is the first painting from my \"Poetry of Flowers\" series to become an NFT. Beginning this process as a hand painted acrylic piece, I have added 3D animated elements and atmospheric sounds.  Making this piece unique as it lives in the digital realm, while still having ties to the physical world.\n\nThe heath bell flower symbolizes quiet reflection, while butterflies represent transformation. \n\nMy pieces from the Poetry of Flowers collection, speak on themes of life, death and reincarnation while using the language of flowers.\n",
