    "description": "Soft, subtle, and warm, the filtered light from the new days sunrise pushes through the tall majestic Karri Trees along the roadside, gently illuminating the scene while battling to push the cool, moist fog from it's domain. \n\nHaving seen it before on a previous trip but being unable to capture it, Good Morning Light was the culmination of numerous return visits to this place with a specific idea for an image.\nOn this morning the fog was spread throughout the Scotsdale Valley in pockets, so to my delight as I rounded the corner the image I had wanted for some time was about to be made.",
