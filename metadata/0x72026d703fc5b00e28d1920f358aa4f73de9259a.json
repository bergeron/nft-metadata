    "name": "Francis' Atheneum",
    "description": "Francis’ Atheneum is a visual library that houses and displays the support, mentorship, friendship, and brotherhood between Francis Yoo & Wesley Han. In 2008, Francis introduced Wesley to a music creation program called “Fruity Loops Studio”; Wesley’s life was forever changed. Since then he has gone on to create his own music as a producer and releases songs under \"Wesley Ruger Han”, “Oogah”, and \"Schine\". They are a reflection of integrative healing experienced through Francis' guidance using psychoanalytical practices such as Jungian psychology, the Enneagram, and more. \n\nThe soundtrack is a remix of their song \"오직 예수\" (Ojik Yesu) they co-produced in 2008. In it you hear the deep hums and the Gayageum, a traditional Korean stringed instrument. They are calls to Korean remembrance as the Gayageum dances with the electric guitar as a display of ancient and modern harmony. Their dance symbolizes healing, integration, transformation, and a display of Wesley's past and future in the now.\n",
