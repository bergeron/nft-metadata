    "description": "bot(A)n(I)ca is a collection of sculptural hybridized species, informed by the elegant art of ikebana, the intricate science of botany, and artificial intelligence. \n\nThe collection of speculative series centers around the prospect of nature's evolution, adaptation, and survival in the midst of technological advancements: what does their form and characteristics reveal about their [digital] environment?\n\nMy arts practice speculates on how nature, might morph, change, survive, and thrive over time, particularly as we enter the digital age - previous collections include 'bloom' , which uses video and post-processing to create surreal stretching botanicals, revealing a DNA-like helix structure as they morph into meta-species, and 'BOTANY: a photographic retrospective', a 184-piece collection that utilizes AI tools to survey camera technology and printing processes since the dawn of photography.\n\nbot(A)n(I)ca will be limited to 50 unique tokens",
