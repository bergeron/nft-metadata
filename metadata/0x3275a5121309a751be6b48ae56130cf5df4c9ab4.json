    "description": "It is nearly impossible to detect the presence of Mifuyu, the descendant of the old aristocratic shinobi clan of Frostfire and the Kami of Winter. Mifuyu is an elegant Kami, with icy pale skin, piercing glacial eyes, and a voice that is silvery and clear like arctic water breaking against river stones. If her ice-shard blade isnâ€™t already at your throat, then her tundra-esque gaze has already taken hold of your heart with a chilling grasp.\n\nArt and Character Design by\nZERONIS\n00:00\n\n1/1 Edition",
