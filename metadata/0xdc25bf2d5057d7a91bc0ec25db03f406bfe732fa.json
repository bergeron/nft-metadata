    "description": "\"Wash\" is part of my series Let´s Gooey! This is a hand made sculpture-like composition made out of common and recognizable dish washing related objects using a tabletop imagery visual language. With it, I explore the connections our mind creates when stimulating our senses and synesthesia.  In my work, I toy with the viewers perception exploring the limits between the real and the digital wolds.\n\n1/1 Edition by Paloma Rincón",
