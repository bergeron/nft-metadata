    "description": "A city created with the techniques associated with early video computer systems and early personal computers - raster bars & color cycling. Raster bars are scrolling, animated bars of color that were common on the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers and in demos for the Commodore Amiga. Color cycling is a technique that was used with paint programs and games on early personal computers, and involves cycling through the colors in a specified palette in order to give the impression of animation. \n\nArtwork info: \nGIF, 960x540, 2022",
