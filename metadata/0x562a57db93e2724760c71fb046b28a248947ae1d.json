She could not hear herself.\n\nIgnoring signs from the universe, but one day on her way to work, Maya saw a painting on the subway that said \"Let Your Heart Smile\" and in that moment she felt a sense of calm, clarity, gratitude, and insight!\n\nAfter that, she started to listen to her heart and pay attention to signs, discovering love from within. In life's hustle, we forget to slow down and listen, but doing so opens us to possibilities and happiness.\n\nFind signs in the most unexpected places.\n\nAI + postprocessing + physical painting (mixed technique on canvas 40x60 cm)\n4k ◦ 3240x2160 px ◦ 3D sound",
