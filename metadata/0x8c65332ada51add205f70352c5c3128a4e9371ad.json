    "description": "The Celebrating Heroes 2022 NFT collection commemorates the 1st Annual Celebrating Heroes weekend in Florence, Texas. The purpose of the event is to celebrate, support, and give thanks to our Law Enforcement and Military heroes. The NFT collection includes fifty Platinum and two hundred Bronze 3D animated coin NFTs (250 NFTs in total).\n\n100% of all creator royalties generated from this collection will go directly to Fallen Blue, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. \n\nFormed by a group of citizens, Fallen Blue supports families of fallen officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving and protecting their communities. Through nation-wide grants, Fallen Blue works to ease the financial burden of families across the country because the officer’s family should not have their grief compounded by financial problems. \n\nAll administrative expenses of the charity are covered by the generosity of a founding donor so donations may be directed to Fallen Blue’s mission.\n\nCelebrating Heroes:\nhttps://www.celebrating-heroes.com\n\nFallen Blue:\nhttps://fallenblueheroes.org",
