    "description": "Artist: Masayuki Akamatsu\n\n\"Thales’ Engraving\" refers to a photograph or video of the starry sky that uses a special long-exposure method. Star trails appear in the dark night sky, sometimes with clouds or thunder, as well as airplanes or satellites. The camera is digitally controlled by a unique device and program, and it takes several tens of minutes to several hours to shoot. With this kind of function, you can get a variety of images that differ each time depending on location, time, weather, and so on.\n\nArtwork: [QmacvqdVkWiSo2dBVtZzNdE71L3rndzbDGgLneA6aN2iPs](https://neort.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmacvqdVkWiSo2dBVtZzNdE71L3rndzbDGgLneA6aN2iPs/1.jpg)\n\nWebsite: [https://thalesengraving.neort.io](https://thalesengraving.neort.io)\n\nArtist Link: [https://akamatsu.org/](https://akamatsu.org/)\n\nLicense: [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)",
