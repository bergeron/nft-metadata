Goldfish is one of the symbols that gives beauty to haft sin, and I believe that wherever the fish is There is light of hope shining there, I wanted to take the goldfish to different cultures in this collection. maybe one day the whole world will think together about the beauties and hope and light of life. this is you And my gorgeous girls... The first place these fish travel to is Egypt.",
