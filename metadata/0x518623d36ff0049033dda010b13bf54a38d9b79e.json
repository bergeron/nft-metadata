    "description": "Manhattan, New York City. 2017\n\nAs soon as you arrive in Manhattan, you instantly feel incredibly small. Even though I've lived near the city my entire life, I am still blown away by the sheer size of the skyscrapers that tower over the streets below. Everytime I stand in their shadow, I feel like a tiny speck of dust compared to these steel giants. ",
