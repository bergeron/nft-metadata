    "description": "As comfortable as we can get that hasn’t happened to us yet... \n\n\"I had been writing a lot during covid lockdown.  After a nice morning surf session I came back to the studio and came up with two parts on the TonePad app on my iPhone.  Thought it was pretty cool and added some drum loops, some Moog Taurus basslines and some synth bass. Sent it to Bayliss asking if he could add anything or work his magic.  He did.\" \n\n- Ryan Stasik\n\n\"During the lockdown we were sending musical ideas back and forth. Ryan sent his demo and I immediately knew there was real potential. I recorded some vocals over his parts and then a few months later I was messing around with what is now the chorus section.  Once I spliced the two together I knew that we had just finished a new song, one that doesn’t sound like anything else we were working on at that time.\"\n\n- Brendan Bayliss\n",
