    "name": "Avatar Mountains",
    "description": "I named this creation Avatar Mountains because the quartz sandstone pillars in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park have been the main inspiration for the international award-winning movie Avatar. \nThe park is located in Wulingyuan Scenic Area, which was recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1992. \nThe most striking geographical feature of the park is the columnar structure that can be seen throughout the park. Although this area is similar to karst terrain, it is not covered with limestone, nor is it the product of chemical dissolution, which is the characteristic of limestone karst. They are the result of years of physical erosion. Much of the weathering that forms these pillars is the result of winter ice expansion and the plants that grow on it. The weather is humid all year round, so the foliage is very lush.\n\n4700 x 5800 | 300 dpi | HDR-Panorama",
