    "description": "A WOMAN WITH THE TECHNOLOGY – CARNIVAL (2019) is a complicated method that examines the \"Filter Bubble\" phenomenon using machine learning (a situation in which an Internet user encounters only information and opinions that conform to and reinforce their own beliefs). Both the title and the video script are generated by an AI-Chatbot that was trained over a 90-day period utilizing all of the artist's social media data (Instagram, Facebook, etc.). This chatbot could be thought of as an artificial intelligence counterpart of the artist. It might also be interpreted as the Internet algorithm's \"guess\" as to who the artist is and what he is interested in. They \"collectively generated\" a ludicrous video script as a result of their chat with this AI Chatbot. Based on this AI-generated script, Ziyang Wu created a 12-episode animated video.\n\nThe original 3D models from Episode 5, multiple dancing figures with surveillance camera heads, and large billboard screens exhibiting stills from Episodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are juxtaposed in A WOMAN WITH THE TECHNOLOGY – CARNIVAL.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/f0b081ec-9f8d-44c0-b3df-6a7c55fc33ec",
