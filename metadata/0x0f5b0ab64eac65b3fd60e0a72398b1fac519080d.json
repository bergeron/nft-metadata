    "description": "Ureong Gaksi (the snail bride) \n\nFolktale from the Joseon Dynasty interpreted in various forms, from comedy to tragedy. \n\nA peasant found a snail on his way back from work one day, and took it home without much thought. However, since then, whenever he came back from work, he found his household chores completed and a hearty dinner prepared. Finding this bizarre, the peasant decided not to go to work and hid himself in his place to observe what happens in his absence. He soon discovered that a beautiful maiden would come out of the shell of the snail, cook and clean for him, then return to said shell. It turned out that the snail was a daughter of the Dragon King of the sea, who was sentenced to a life of servitude due to her mischief. Touched by her beauty and kindness, the peasant proposed to her, and they lived happily ever after.\n\nThis piece contains the artist’s recitation of poet No Chunmyung’s “Hope,” and an original score by musician Ji-Sung.",
