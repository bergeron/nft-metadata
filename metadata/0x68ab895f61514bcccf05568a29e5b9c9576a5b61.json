    "description": "This genesis piece is perhaps one of my favorite photographs I have ever made. \nEnjoying the moment, surrounded by nothing more than the roar of rushing water. This frame was captured on a crisp Fall morning in the Canadian Rockies, soon to be covered in snow just a few short days later. \nI hope you enjoy this fleeting moment from Fall 2021 and Sunwapta Falls entitled \"Flow.\"\n\n\nThe collector of this 1 of 1 edition will receive a 23x30 fine art print and the full resolution file.",
