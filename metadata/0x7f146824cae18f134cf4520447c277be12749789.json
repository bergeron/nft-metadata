    "description": "Revered as a goddess, a lifeline to millions, the Ganges is believed to fall from the heavens and land on the head of a god, then off a single strand of his hair to escape down to the Earth.\n\nWhile I gained elevation to seek the river's source - the Gangotri glacier,  I wondered how the story originated. \nContinuing a few miles above, I reached a vast meadow confronted by a towering mountain.\nThe high alt meadow enveloped a sense of tranquility in the air.  \nLocals called it \"Tapovan\" - a meditation garden.\n\nOn the parting night, long past dusk, as I lay down under a blanket of million stars, arose a dazzling milky way leaving me in absolute awe.\n\nEverything stopped at that moment. \n\nDevoid of thought, I just felt...belonged.\n\nMoments later, like an epiphany, everything rushed back to me.\n\nThe celestial river pours on the head of the mountain; a gentle stream is heard flowing to unite with the larger river.\n\n\nEdition: 1/1\nResolution: 3832 x 5129\nLicense: Extended Editorial\nYear: 2019",
