    "description": "Has your mind ever been in a fog? Difficult to concentrate and then there is one thought that makes its way through. This piece is about finding that light through the fog. \n\nStory behind the shot: \nI made the early morning drive north to the Adirondack wilderness, right at the end of peak foliage season in a last ditch effort to get some more fall images for the year. I had missed a few prime weeks while traveling to Iceland and hadn't had the chance to do a lot of scouting this year. It’s about a two hour drive for me from the capital region of New York where I live and I got a later start than I had wanted to. Due to this, my timing was a little off and I was in a rush to get to the spot I had scouted. I had planned to catch sunrise from the top of Whiteface mountain but as I was nearing it, the sun began to light up the valleys around me. Thick pockets of fog hung in every low point as I drove through and this particular field had a massive tree standing alone in the center. The bright yellow foliage stood out against the dense fog to further isolate it from its surroundings. Since I was already running late, I drove right past this scene without stopping. About a mile down the road I made the decision to abandon my original plan and turn around. I drove back to this location and took out my camera. I’m glad I did!",
