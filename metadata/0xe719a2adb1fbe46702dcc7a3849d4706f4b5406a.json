    "description": "On April 1, 2022 Piv tweeted \"Who wore it better? Scrambled Phunk pixels vs. 4900 Colours\": https://twitter.com/piv_piv/status/1509816169208946689\n\n\n'Scrambled Phunk pixels' was a pixel art color scramble and I wanted to \"do it big\" by taking it to millions of pixels of CryptoPunk colors.\n\n\nThe goal was a noise-like effect, but there was a bug in my code that created stripes instead. I thought it looked cool, so I created a version with \"light colors only\" and Tweeted it with the message \"might delete.\"\n\n\nThe message refers to the fact that the design wasn't \"intentional\" or \"artistic\" but rather just looked cool. I don't consider this \"art,\" but it does feel good to look at.\n\n\n(Of course Gerhard Richter has done stripes as well.)",
