    "description": "Vibrant. Evolving. Welcome to CTY:01, the metropolis that never loses its luster.\n\nUnder the gaze of the towering headquarters of the Unified Intelligence Agency, the citizens go about their lives blissfully unaware of the dark machinations. In the shadows, a lone renegade stands in defiance of his brother’s nefarious ambitions. \n\nThe technology that runs the city traces its roots to their father, the Founder. mmTECH was created decades ago to improve the way of life. However, the father’s vision was corrupted by his own blood. What is meant to improve is now used to control.  \n\nThe UIA aims to dominate the council’s agenda however they face resistance from within. Xander and his cohorts are firm believers in the vision of the Founder and will not capitulate. \n\nThe renegade rallies whoever heed his premonition of what is to come. The future of the city is in flux however it is not too late to prevent the malevolent ascendancy of the UIA.  \n",
