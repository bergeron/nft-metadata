    "description": "Sea of Dreams is a photograph that encompasses the beauty and distortion I feel with in myself.  The dark waters perceived as elegant and sophisticated, juxtaposed by the uneasy perspective of the mysterious and odd landscape in the distance.  This photograph is a reminder that we can be both at ease and uneasy, beautiful and distorted, brave and afraid.  This piece is ultimately about acceptance and self love.",
