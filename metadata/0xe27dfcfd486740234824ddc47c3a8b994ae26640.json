By physically erasing emulsion from photographic paper I add hand-drawn gestures that insert my embodied voice into an otherwise mechanical and digital process. The erasures act as redactions – models of resistance – that invert established photographic assumptions and systems that control who gets to see what and why. They cannot be ignored. The perceived negative “lack” of the erasure mark becomes an affirmation; the absence becomes a presence.\n\nThe pieces are a series of translations:\n\nDigital photo data > archival pigment print object > hand erased > re-digitization > immutable dematerialization of image data back into code as NFT via IFPS \n\nThe result: embodied nothingness",
