    "description": "When love beckons to you, follow him,  \nThough his ways are hard and steep.  \nAnd when his wings enfold you yield to him,  \nThough the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.  \nAnd when he speaks to you believe in him.  \nThough his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.  \nFor even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth  \nso is he for your pruning.  \nEven as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that  \nquiver in the sun,  \nSo shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.  \nLike sheaves of corn, he gathers you unto himself.  \nHe threshes you to make you naked.  \nHe sifts you to free you from your husks.  \nHe grinds you to whiteness.  \nHe kneads you until you are pliant;  \nAnd then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for  \nGodâ€™s sacred feast. \nText from \"the Prophet\" - Khalil Gibran",
