    "description": "Albina is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking NFT that captures the essence of a young girl sitting at home at her computer, lighting a cigarette in the dark. The blue backlighting adds a sense of mystery and intrigue to the scene, while the overloaded painting style, reminiscent of Van Gogh's brushstrokes, gives the piece a dreamlike quality. The photorealistic elements add a level of realism to the piece, making it all the more striking.\n\nThe animation depicts Albina in a state of contemplation, lost in thought as she smokes and gazes at her computer screen.\n\nBut what if you look into her soul? The daily routine, Groundhog Day, every day and every night Albina sits at the computer and smokes. The artist has captured the monotony of her existence and the longing for something more. Albina's world is a lonely one, filled with the harsh glow of her computer screen and the smoke from her cigarette. It's a world of isolation and disconnection, but also a world of possibility and hope.",
