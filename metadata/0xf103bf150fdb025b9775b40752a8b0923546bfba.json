    "description": "The machines have taken over,\nAnd our creativity they smother.\nWe can't turn back the hands of time,\nOr reverse technology's uphill climb.\n\nThe screen's allure is hard to break,\nAnd our creative souls are at stake.\nWe must find ways to adapt and thrive,\nAnd keep our imaginative spirits alive.\n\nTechnology needn't be a foe,\nWe just need to learn to let go.\nOf distractions and digital noise,\nAnd rediscover our inner voice.\n\nSo let's embrace the tools we've made,\nBut not let them rule our creative trade.\nFor though it's too late to turn the tide,\nOur creativity can still be our guide.",
