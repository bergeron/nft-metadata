    "description": "My most famous render by far.  I initially created the mushrooms\nusing Inspire3D (an introductory version of Lightwave) and did a render using Bryce. When I purchased Lightwave[6] I did a second render using only Lightwave and this is the result. \n\nIt was really just meant to be an exercise in using gradients to control luminosity and transparency ending up becoming an icon. \n\nMillions have downloaded and displayed this wallpaper over the years and it's pretty much become my signature.",
