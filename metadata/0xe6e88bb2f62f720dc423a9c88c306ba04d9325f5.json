    "description": "GENEVA is a futuristic take on female representation through art, using cyberpunk visualization and transhumanism themes. \n\nTo start this collection of artworks, I'm very excited to introduce my first character: AVA. \n\nThe collection's primary discussion is centered on having a worldwide visual anchor of non-functional techno-augmented body parts that reflect the level of augmentation for each person in a potential future we might achieve.\n\nThe pace of technology is moving so fast that it's making it more and more challenging to keep up with the changes in society, business, our lives - and how we interact. What does this mean for all the females of the future? And how can we imagine our reality in relationship with these representations?\n\nIn a more immediate sense it's about our direction based on how we live today - disconnected and lonely, trying to escape death through recreation and consumerism. \n\nGENEVA created with help from the artificial intelligence entity known as DALL-E. \n",
