    "description": "From one of my favorite mornings to date. On the morning of June 24, 2015 we drove out to Maligne Lake in Jasper National Park to watch the sunrise. We visited the lake on the previous day but were met with pretty bad weather, so we had high hopes for a good sunrise. We arrived to epic foggy and mirror like conditions and I was able to capture this moment on Kodak Portra 400 film.",
