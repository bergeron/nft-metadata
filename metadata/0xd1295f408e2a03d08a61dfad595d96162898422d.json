    "description": "As water continually changes phase within our atmosphere, it\nreflects the metamorphosis and regeneration process thatkeeps organic life in a harmonic balance with all other forms of creation. Through my artistic process, I explore the limitless creative potential of water as a source through which pigments and heat can combine to create complex geometric patterns, fractal-like detail, and stunning\nabstractions.  \n\nThese videos are extension and expansion of my creative process with water. All moving images are the actual Living Art; recorded during my work on the physical art piece. As I manipulate these moving images via digital technology, I add a second layer of creation to my work. Traditional techniques and new media technologies merge into one unique piece of art. It’s both the beginning and the end. It’s the “ GENESIS OF WATER “.\n",
