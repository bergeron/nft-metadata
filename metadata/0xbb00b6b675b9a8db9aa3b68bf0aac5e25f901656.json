    "description": "Average Creatures is the first all-handmade sculpture/photography NFT PFP hybrid collection on the block(chain). That's right, each piece was made by hand and photographed separately. Inspired by '80s art, media, and entertainment in all of its practical effects glory, Average Creatures pays homage to that now oh so distant time in history: our childhood. Each Average Creature in this collection is the curated result of a combination of hundreds of elements and layers, which were photographed and composited together to form a unique piece. Mixing several art techniques to create a visual style that defies convention, this project explores traditional art forms that have yet to be used together in any other PFP project. From set design to sculpting, costuming to painting, each Average Creature has a vivid personality that truly redefines how we think of the word average.",
