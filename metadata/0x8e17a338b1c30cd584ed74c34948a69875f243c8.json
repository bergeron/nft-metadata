    "description": "Somehow, sunrises and the beach just make a natural pair.\n\nFor a long time, sunrises on the beach were a large focus in my photography - almost every time I went out to shoot, it was a sunrise on one of the many beaches here in Southern Delaware.\n\nOver the years, I have continued to enjoy shooting the start of the day down in the sand, but also grew away from it more than I would like to admit.\n\nThis particular photo, shot at Tower Road Oceanside in Dewey Beach, serves as a reminder of exactly why I enjoy that time of day and spending time on the beach as much as I do.\n\nBeing able to capture scenes like these put my mind at ease, and hopefully sharing this piece of Sun and Sand can do that for someone else as well.\n\n25% of profits on this piece will be donated to Oceana, an organization seeking to preserve the health of the world's oceans and ensuring the future of their biodiversity.",
