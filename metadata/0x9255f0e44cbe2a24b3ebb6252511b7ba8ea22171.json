    "description": "A photograph of two beautiful women adorned in colourful traditional attires.  \nThe art and culture of a lot of African tribes is embodied in their clothing as it features bold colours and very intricate designs. It shows a rich historical, cultural and artistic identity that is unique to each of these tribes. Here I highlight WOMEN from two separate tribes in Nigeria, The Yoruba and the Igbo who are some of the largest tribes in Africa.",
