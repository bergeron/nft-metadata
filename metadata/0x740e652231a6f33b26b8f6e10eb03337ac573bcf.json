    "description": "This giant inflatable bear is one of the highlights of the Christmas season last 2017. When I was shooting a skyline, I saw the crane from behind and thought of something fun. It showed that the bear is actually fishing. It reminded me of the generosity of the people here in Web 3 when looking at it recently. The bear continues to fish to give back to the community around it.",
