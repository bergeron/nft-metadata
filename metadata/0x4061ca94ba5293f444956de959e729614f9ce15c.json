    "description": "The first poem to be released as part of the \"Ten\" collection  \nby Luke Dogwalker.  \nEach poem is minted in 5 \"editions\" which have their own unique traits beyond the words themselves,  \nbalancing the line between multiple editions and 1/1. \n\nAll collectors are invited to join me on Twitter @_lukedogwalker  \nand or Instagram @lukedogwalker  \nplaces where our little pack will live for now.  \nWith these first few steps into the NFT space I hope to share and give back as much as been given to me, in terms of kindness and guidance.\n\nPoem reads:\n\n\"human, kind\"\n\nmay I greet today \nfor that which it is,  \nand unmerited gift granted  \ndespite the many I've taken for--\n\nmay I always be kind;  \nbring warmth to the wicked,  \nhear voice of the hushed,  \ngive attention and sight to unseen.\n\nmay I always be curious;  \nembrace and explore  \nwith wonder and awe  \nthe very tools with which I was born.\n\nand may I get into mischief--  \nbalance the beam between  \nwhat may be sensible and  \nwhat may be preposterous--\n\nI've looked out--and now  \nlooking in, from the edge of what is,  \nI see a world which could be  \na new tradition",
