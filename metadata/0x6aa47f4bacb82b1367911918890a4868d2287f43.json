    "description": "7 second Video Loop with music. One of the first Pepeâ€™s to be glitched by renowned and pioneering digital artist Marjan Moghaddam, using her original and unique style of 3dCG figuration, glitching and Chronometric Sculpture. Marjan worked with 2d glitched elements that were voxelized. She then further glitched Pepe using sculpted and procedural/generative deformations. The musical score uses various forms of sound artifacting or glitch as well. "
