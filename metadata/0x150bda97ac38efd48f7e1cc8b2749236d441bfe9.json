    "description": "\nMaïm’s 22-second silent “CGI 002 - Compassion-Generated Imagery 002” (2022) engages with trans joy, digital sensuality, and noise aesthetics. AI experiments and visual noise-making influence the artistic decisions to significantly reduce the render time. The deep blue, orange-pink color palette and strong light contrast playfully reenact conventions in sci-fi cinematic scenes, hi-tech advertisements, or Baroque painting. The gender non-conforming human standing still in an abandoned location is a 3D scan of the artist’s lover. Their pose and the flying cloth simulation refer to “The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa” sculpture by Bernini (1598-1680). \n---\n22 seconds CGI sequence, 3D & AI, silent, 1920x1080, 24 FPS.\n40hrs pre-prod., 32hrs prod., 18hrs post-prod. incl. 8hrs render time. \nMade with Maya, Arnold, Houdini, Photoshop, Lightroom, EM3D, After Effect, EbSynth.",
