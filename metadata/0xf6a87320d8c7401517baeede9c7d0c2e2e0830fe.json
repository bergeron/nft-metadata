    "description": "JC’s collection of Supercar artwork is powered by UA3, partners of Cypher Capital.\n\nJC’s love for Supercars came about in 2018 during his first visit to Dubai. He was obsessed with their explosive engine sounds, beautifully contoured lines, sharp edges and bold colours. He saw the cars as works of art and couldn’t wait to paint some of the world's most exclusive models.\n\nWhilst others might appreciate the classic red Ferrari, they may not see the fantastic kaleidoscope of colours JC sees with the trees, blue skies and city back drop reflecting in that red exterior.\n\nThe 1/1 NFTs in the Supercars DXB collection come with the original IRL paintings as it’s utility, with their exclusivity matching the cars themselves.",
