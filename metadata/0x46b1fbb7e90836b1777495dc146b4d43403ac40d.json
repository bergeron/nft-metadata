    "description": "The view that bridges generations. Rolling evergreen trees, stark granite walls, and dramatic waterfalls dance to the wind in the distance. Thereâ€™s something romantic about visiting places where time stands still. The beauty on the horizon varies just enough to make each visit a special moment. A place where perhaps these two people share past memories, laughs, and everlasting love of nature.\n\nImage was taken on a Canon Rebel G camera with Kodak 35mm film.",
