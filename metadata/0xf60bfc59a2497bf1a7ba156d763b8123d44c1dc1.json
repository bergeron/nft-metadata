    "description": "Just imagine you’ve found a street photographer’s film by chance. What kind of person he is, what his preferences and views are, how many things he conceals from everybody and from himself as well. You possess only 36 shots to reveal all these and to look at this world through his eyes. \n\nTo be precise, with my eyes, because I am the photographer.\n\nStreet photography is a possibility for me to have a rest from the shooting process where everything has been already planned and considered.\nIt is spontaneous and intuitive like a jazz improvisation. I give a reaction to this or that moment often not even realizing why I do it. \n\nIt is a good way to get around the mind traps and to show your real self  and then while looking through everything you’ve shot, get acquainted with it better.\n\nSo 36 various streets, 36 moments of synchronization and 36 shots like the classical reportage film has.",
