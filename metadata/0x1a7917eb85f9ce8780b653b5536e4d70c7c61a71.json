    "description": "I'm a French professional photographer living in the Westfjords of Iceland, the most remote region of the country. During the last 10 years, I've been involved in scientific studies conducted by the Nature institute of Iceland and have extensively documented the harsh life of the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) in Iceland.  \n\n\"Surviving\" is a portrait of a blue morph Arctic fox taken in July 2021. The strength of the fox's gaze emphasizes the animal's determination and the resilience needed to survive in such a harsh environment. \n\nAll proceeds of this open edition will be added to the fund I created to publish a book about Arctic foxes and help spreading awareness about their conservation.  \n",
