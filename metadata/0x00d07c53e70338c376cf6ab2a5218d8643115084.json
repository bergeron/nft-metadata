    "description": "Rimac Nevera, a fully electric hypercar with 1914 horsepower and a top speed of 412 km/h, was created to provide an unprecedented level of performance. It has four electric motors with a total power of 1914 hp and 2360 Nm of torque and will be the most powerful and fastest accelerating homologated car in production, regardless of the type of powertrain transmission. It is completely designed, developed and manufactured at the company Rimac Automobili in Croatia, and Nevera proudly bears a Croatian name, which truly reflects the extraordinary performance that it can release in the blink of an eye. Nevera is a powerful Mediterranean storm, charged with lightning, which appears with extraordinary speed and strength. The Rimac hypercar shares with this type of storm not only the name, but also its character. Like the natural force after which it is named, it is equally capable of instantly changing its character from a safe and comfortable grand tourer to a high-performance car - Nevera retains its stunning acceleration throughout the cycle of full throttle and reaches 300 km/h from start in just 9.3 seconds. In addition, the car achieves a record fast 8.6 seconds per quarter mile (0-402 meters).",
