    "name": "Monster Triles",
    "description": "The flower monster Triles lived in the forest. He was very lonely. Triles came to the children at night and hid to watch the children fall asleep. \n\nHe was depicted in a complex green paint, woven from all possible colors. He was always surrounded by flowers. And his eyes shone as bright as stars.\n\nTriles fed on the fear of children. As soon as night fell, he appeared from the darkest corner of the house. There was a loud creaking. Every time the children guessed that it was the monster Triles. The children admired the flowers that Triles cultivated near their bed. And with the first rays of the sun, he left, and took the child with him.",
