    "description": "Several years ago Rauschenberg said: 'I try to act in the gap between art and life', for that gap continues to narrow. Art has been veritably invaded by life, if life means flux, change, chance, time, unpredictability. Sometimes the only difference between the two is sheer consciousness, the awareness that what seemed to be a stain on the wall is in fact a work of art.
