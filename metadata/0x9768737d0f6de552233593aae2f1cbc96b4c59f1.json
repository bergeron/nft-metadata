    "description": "\"After\" is a glimpse in to the combination of sound experimentation and songwriting that is so integral to Koastle. It pushes the boundaries of our sound design in tandem with a powerful hook that delivers an emotional experience filled with both excitement and somberness - a raw collection of feelings left open to interpretation. \n\n\"After\" is the first edition of our new project called Koastcards. Each month we will be traveling to a new location to present 4 new releases that will drop each week: \n\nWeek 1: Electric Oyster (Mix Series) \nWeek 2: EDM song \nWeek 3: a remix \nWeek 4: pop song\n\nKoastcards is a check-in with all of our fans, to catch them up on our travels, our releases and our journey - an invitation to come alongside us in experiencing the good times we haven't had yet. \n\nFor this first episode of Koastcards we are traveling to San Onofre, CA - a staple in Southern California for its remote surf beaches and untouched coastal landscape. This marks a perfect spot for us to debut this new project debuting officially in January 2023. ",
