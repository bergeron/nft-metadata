    "name": "The Winged Globe - Hadit",
    "description": "Hadit identifies himself as the point in the center of the circle, the axle of the wheel, the cube in the circle, \"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star,\" and the worshipper's own inner self. Hadit has been interpreted as the inner spirit of man, the Holy Ghost, the sperm and egg in which the DNA of man is carried, the Elixir Vitae. When juxtaposed with Nuit in The Book of the Law, Hadit represents each unique point-experience. These point-experiences in aggregate comprise the sum of all possible experience, Nuit.",
