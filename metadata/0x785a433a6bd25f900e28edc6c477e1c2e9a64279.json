    "description": "Jimmy Shoe\n\n\nMeet 32 year old Vijay .\n\nHis little corner stall opens at 10:30 am & shuts at 8:00 pm . The stall is just a corner on the footpath with a plastic mat and a loose thatch for when it rains . He sits all day repairing shoes on his anvil & fixes broken umbrellas too .\n\nHis hands laced with polish , his “om” tattoo almost disappearing under the polish, caught my attention.\n\n\nLocation : India \nDimensions : 4902 x 3922\n",
