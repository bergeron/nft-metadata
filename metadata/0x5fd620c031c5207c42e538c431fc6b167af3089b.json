    "description": "There are a large number of structural norms in our world, which can make it very orderly. But a world that is too ordered can become a world in which certain elements no longer have a link, no connection between them. And we can even see that different things which don't correspond to the standards, can be considered as incorrect or even as non-existent. It can lose their value. And it can even be rejected because it has not found its place.\n\nCaptured in Nice, France.\nDimensions ｜ 6103 × 4069 ｜ 300 dpi\n\n* If you want, the first collector can claim a signed A5 physical print.",
