    "description": "An endless expanse of ancient ice.\n\nI wonder what memories are trapped in these layers of history? What record of humankind is preserved? Civilization, evolution, renaissance... eons passing by in the blink of an eye. For every melt there was a freeze, the land giving way to walls of ice that carved mountains as it passed by. Below the ice, lava boils in anticipation.\n\nThis photo is my artistic compliment to Salt and Dust. In Iceland, the \"land of fire and ice\", there is a balance of destruction and regeneration. There is a give and take between the violence and the tranquility. The chaos and the calm exist in perfect unison, shown in these images. ",
