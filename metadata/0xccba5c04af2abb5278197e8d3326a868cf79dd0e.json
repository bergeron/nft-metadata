    "description": "Considering the title of this painting, I tried to narrate a stage of contemporary Iranian art, which is a kind of transition from traditions to a stage of contemporary modernism, in order to present a kind of global common language.\nIn this painting, high-speed and extremely exciting movements of the brush are used in the upper and lower parts of the painting, and in the central part of the work, we are faced with a fluid and dynamic flow with traditional and classical Iranian colors, sense and atmosphere.\nAll in all, the artwork \"Transition\" has been one of the rare and wonderful creations among my works.\n\nPanel dimensions: 100 x 100 cm\nTechnique: Acrylic on Canvas\nYear of creation: 2023\n",
