    "description": "Sunday  \nFebruary 5th, 2023\n\nSunday is a slow day in our house, we usually stay in bed a bit longer. \nBut, today is a sunny Sunday, it’s so warm and bright outside, so I decide to get up early. \n\nI made myself a cup of warm cappuccino and  light my cigarette (i wish it was weed, though.)  \nAlso eating my daughter chocolate bar is one of my favorite, lol! \n\nI always start my day by sitting on my desk and just doodling around, trying to get myself in the mood for the day, to do stuff around the house. \n\nI have this new knickknack on my desk.  \nit’s a little blue and white house made of ceramic; my aunt gave this tiny house decoration to me a while ago. \n\nA little backstory of the tiny house, though. \nSo, my aunt used to work as a stewardess for KLM Airlines and she got this little decoration from her company. This tiny house decoration actually not a decoration at all, it’s actually a juice bottle from the Netherlands.  \nI find that really interesting. \n\nAfter a few hours doodling around I go outside to check on my plants with my dog, Sunday.  \nPlants are doing great, they kept growing and growing. I love tending my plants because it calms me down",
