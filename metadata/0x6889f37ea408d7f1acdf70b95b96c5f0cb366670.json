    "name": "Beaming Moonset",
    "description": "Wind rushes over the 12,000ft peaks down onto the crystal-clear lake. Standing in that moment, feeling the power of the mountains.\n\nA full moon illuminates the scene with enough light to see everything clearly with just the naked eye. All whilst stars twinkle in the sky. Standing there, alone, fully engulfed in the pure power and beauty of the towering peaks of the Eastern Sierra. As the moon dips below the jagged peaks, a beaming pink glow intensifies with every passing minute. No moment has every felt so magical. \n\nThis was the moment I had been hunting for. The moment that felt so impossible to find. After capturing this image, I couldn't help myself from jumping around like a little kid. This was the first image I had created in a high-altitude mountainous situation that I was truly proud of. One for the ages.\n\nExperiences like this are what drive me. The hunt for the perfect image, the most magical moments imaginable.",
