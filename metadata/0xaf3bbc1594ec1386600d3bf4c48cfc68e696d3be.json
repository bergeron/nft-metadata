    "description": "I was told by my parents that I had some hair when I was born, but only few. They disappeared completely when I turned 3. I was diagnosed with total alopecia only at the age of 4. \nI remember myself as a kid sitting in front of the mirror, combing my imaginary hair and crying. It happened quite often. \nI blamed myself, my parents and doctors for my hair absence. I could not get away from feelings of injustice and social discrimination for quite a long time. Still, I wanted to be happy and love myself just the way I am. But I couldn't experience this feeling sincerely and completely. \nDesire to stop hiding real me appeared a very long time ago. I seriously thought about it only a few times in my life. I lived in a little city, wishing to start life from scratch in metropolis.  Apparently, I reached the boiling point in all life spheres in January 2021. I published a video without hair in tik tok having no idea that soon it would have change my life. I started streaming without wig.",
