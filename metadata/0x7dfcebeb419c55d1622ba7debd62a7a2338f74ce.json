    "description": "Digital Resting Points are soothing destinations hidden around the internet. \n\nThis project became a social media trend, including a post on The Museum of Contemporary Art's Twitter.\n\nSighSwoon takes inspiration from the way video games and digital mediums create a sense of surprise or reward with simple text. Think of a “Congratulations!” pop-up on 90s Internet Explorer, or an alert that a quest item was discovered in an adventure game. Digital Resting Points are SighSwoon’s way of creating her own simulated moments in the internet landscape.\n\nThese moments, designed to make the viewer feel both soothed and rewarded spread across social media. Multiple users around the world began filming moments of calm or beauty in their own life and dubbing it a “Digital Resting Point”, often adding the full text. Digital Resting Points are now posted daily on all social media platforms, most of which can be found on TikTok and Instagram stories with or without the hashtag #digitalrestingpoint. ",
