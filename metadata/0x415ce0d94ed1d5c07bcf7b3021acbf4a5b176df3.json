    "description": "Chapter 01 | Episode 02 | \"Terror, Censorship\"\n\n       The journalist came to the kitchen, prepared his coffee, made a decision for tomorrow's headline, but never returned. The news was censored, the journalist was assassinated! His murder was a violation of freedom of expression. What was the news that caused his death?\n\n* This collection is a narrative from the 1930s. In the first part, we see the scene of a journalist's room. On a rainy night, he returns home with important news, hangs his coat and hat, and goes to the kitchen to prepare coffee and think about tomorrow's important headline. Tomorrow he will write the most controversial headline. *\n\nSoundtrack By Kiarash Baktashian\n\n\n2700x2160 Pixels\n00:00:30 Sec",
