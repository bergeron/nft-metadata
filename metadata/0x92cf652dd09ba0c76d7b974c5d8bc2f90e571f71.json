    "description": "This AI series explores the generative space between figuration and abstraction. The work integrates ideas and aesthetics from 15th century Renaissance painting, architecture, mathematics, systems and modernism. Additionally, the work considers the artifacts and anomalies of stable diffusion as expressive properties of its emergent materialityâ€”something to engage with, even embrace, not to reject or conceal.",
