    "description": "It has been 7 months since I dropped my last Music NFT and I have been working day in and day out. We have been doing daily Underground Violet Rave spaces for the past 10 months growing the community.\n\nThis track will be my return to finally preview the music I been working on for my upcoming major project Raver Realm. \n\nThis track was recorded in New York City in a night where I just felt like there was too much judgement in the world. Too many people telling me what type of music I am \"supposed\" to make. I wanted to create something that just brings the energy needed to ignore all the outside noise and have everyone turn up. \n\nSo much love to everyone that takes the time to listen, I cannot wait until you guys hear the rest of the music on the Raver Realm project because it will blow your mind.",
