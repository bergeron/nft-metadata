    "description": "WORLD 1: SHAPESHiFTED\n\nTRACK 4: FALL SOON (WiLL JUERGENS REMiX)\n\nMAi: Will and i's journey is one for the books.   Will and i are both from Pittsburgh and he originally hit me up very early on in my producer/engineer journey.  I was working solely with one artist and really didn't venture out much, but Will's music that he'd sent was something i was almost looking for at the time.  super unique but having a modern feel that could be obtainable.  the first time we actually worked together, Will claims to have \"stormed out\", where i see it more of a light rain.  Nonetheless, Will understood the power that was hidden within the garage, and just knew i needed some time to harness it.  in the midst of what this project has within it, Will reached out and wanted to catch up.  I had just moved and somehow, someway, we discovered we lived 2 minutes from each other.  We began working on what people now know as \"I NEED A JOB\", which is semi-kinda-legendary.  the rest is honestly pretty cool too but just know we got many tracks together now and we're both here and that was before here, so do the math on that and let me know. \n\ni already know Will typed up some witchcraft below so just stop reading here if you're queasy \n\nWiLL: a poem \n\nThere is a winter growing\nIn the middle of your summer\nDeer listen to me\nThey rarely run away\nOutside of my window\nI watch them where they lay\nGetting grass stuck in their oversized front teeth\nThey listen while I play.\nIf I got hungry oh\nIf I got hungry oh\nIf I get hungry oh \nIf I get hungry there it is.\nBetter find a cave to hibernate in.\n\na song for the winter growing in your summer.\n\nORIGINAL SONG: https://beta.catalog.works/maiworld/fall-soon\nSHAPESHiFTED BY: WiLL JUERGENS\nMASTERED BY: MiGHTY33",
