    "description": "Lucky was a lab technician moonlighting as a trader of corporate secrets, building a private collection of advanced scientific equipment with the considerable proceeds of his work. He was known in the scientific community for advanced specialization in mycelia and biocomputers, and in the dark spaces where information was brokered as a ruthless independent contractor. He lived alone in an unremarkable series of shipping containers he had set up across Europe, most recently in Amsterdam to Stockholm. As the quarantine progressed, he retreated from his dual life as the power of the corporations and private militia took over law enforcement with a vastly different approach to due process and punishment. He buried himself in research, but with the looming paranoia that the past has a way of catching up to you when some of it is made immutable.",
