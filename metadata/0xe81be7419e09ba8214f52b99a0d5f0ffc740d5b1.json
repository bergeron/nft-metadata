    "description": "A Rare Desert Pepe, \n\nOn a cold 19 degree morning in Southern Utah, December 13th, 2021, I was flying over one of my favorite texture rich landscapes that I have come to love during my Utah adventures. Upon closer inspection in the distance, I noticed something completely unique in the distance and flew over immediately.  \n\nAs I hovered over this alien-like landscape, I couldn't believe my eyes seeing this earthly formation that resembled a face, or a Pepe if you will, surrounded by these eye-catching red and blue texture formations. \n\nCapturing unique and unseen desert texture imagery is a form of photography I am passionate about, and have completely fallen in love with.",
