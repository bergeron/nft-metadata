    "description": "Summer, 1978. \n\nGrand Canyon National Park, Arizona, USA\n\nTaken w/ a Yashica Electro 35 GSN Rangefinder on Kodachrome Film.\n\nWhen was the last time you felt free? It's 1978, and we're spending the summer roaming the United States together. We've got a sense of wonder, we've got a camera, and we've got each other. \n\nThis is the last time we were young.",
