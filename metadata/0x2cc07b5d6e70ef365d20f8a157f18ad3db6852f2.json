    "description": "I travelled over 20,000 km to photograph Kirkjufell mountain. Millions of years old, its layers were formed through volcanic eruptions and its unique shape was influenced by the pressure of two glaciers. It is both ancient and majestic.\n\nThis image was taken during a number of wintry nights of photography around Grundarfjörður, Iceland. My aim was to capture a unique perspective incorporating the many interesting elements presented here.\n\nThis is the first piece from my genesis collection.\n\nEdition: 1/1\nTitle: Pinnacle\nArtist: Tomas Milan\nDimensions: 5760 x 3840 px\nCollection: Inspired by Nature\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
