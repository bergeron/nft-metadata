    "description": "This photo was taken in a modern building named \"Namaz Khaneh\" made by iranian famous architect \"Kamran Diba\".\nThis building is so simple in structure yet so amazing in concept! To me, this structor is a symbol of true minimalism.\nThis photo was taken in 2019 and uploaded to the \"Unsplash\" platform days after that. And to this date, it has more than 2 milion views and more than 8000 downloads on that platform.",
