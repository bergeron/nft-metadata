    "description": "8192 x 2048\n\nAfter experiencing this insane month full of countless war crimes in Ukraine committed by putin. This piece is an evidence of the fact that our spirit is not even \nnearly broken and all their inhuman, dark deeds never ever will be able to change our attitude to who we are, what we do and what we love. Love to our families, love to our friends, love to our lives and freedom.\n\nHere is my first NFT made outside of any collaborations. \n\nMade during the war in Ukraine. \nEven this nightmare could not take my love and passion I had while I was working on this piece.\n\nI call it \"Safe Harbour\"\n\nAll raised ETH from the sale will go to COMEBACKALIVE.\n\nProof of the transaction will be posted on my twitter @lehko_ \n\nGlory to Ukraine!",
