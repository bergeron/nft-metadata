    "description": "<p>Since my early childhood, I didn't fit, ANYWHERE, despite my efforts to conform to a small town and cult religion. Nobody understood me, least of all, me. The aching need to truly, truly self-express in the wild ways my soul demanded, broke all the rules and held me imprisoned in fear, insecurity and guilt. That tied-up shell version of me began to shatter through the cleansing pain of fire. This NFT gives you permission to truly become You. Kiss the flame, embrace your transformation, free your Self. I Åm the Årtist. I am opening Portals.  I Love You...</p>",
