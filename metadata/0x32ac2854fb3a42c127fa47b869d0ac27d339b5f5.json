    "description": "They want to see me fail, \nDisparaging my efforts at every turn. \n\nFor a long time, there was no escape. \nThe voice I would often hear- was in my head. \n\nSharp tongues speaking in dead languages. \nHoisting my failures before me, to further break my spirit. \n\nStrangling my voice into a silent mouthing of words. \n\nErasing me. \n\nContorting self-worth into disrepair. \nLeading deeper into uncertainty... \n\n*** In a moment of clarity- strength, will and identity revealed itself in the very thing they told me I was... [Garbage] \n\nAnd for that- I must thank you, Heckler(s).  \n_________________________________________________________________  \nThis edition is the result of Tustont's Recycling Protocol- which only occurs when a 1/1 piece of Garbage has not been collected within 30 days of initial mint- it is then BURNED and re-minted as an edition on this contract.",
