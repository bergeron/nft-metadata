    "description": "It was a beautiful day in the Bay Area so I decided to do some long exposure photography on the coast near Lands End. Sadly, by the time I got there, everything was blanketed by a thick fog. “Typical San Francisco”, I told myself. I didn’t bother to take out my camera anymore, but I also didn’t feel like going back home, so I decided to take a walk along the shoreline. I was lost in my own thoughts when I encountered a scene that left me speechless: a graceful lady, dressed in black, sitting on a bench, and surrounded by a murder of crows. (Yes— that’s how you call a gathering of those enigmatic birds!). The whole scene seemed surreal, and I was even unsure as to whether I should try to make an approach, but after gathering some courage, I shyly asked the lady whether I could photograph her. She slowly turned her head toward me, smiled ever so slightly, and made a gesture of approval. Without wasting any precious time, I took my camera and started to document this magical moment.\n",
