    "description": "Rain is R&B. Smooth, easy, and filled with every emotion needed to tell the story...\n\nNone of the music I make is made up. I've either lived it in the past, present, or have witnessed something that inspired the message. This song is about give and take, and how the giver needs just as much as the receiver; The rain replenishes both. \n\nI really hope you love this song! It's from the heart. \n\nProduction: DIVUS\nMixed/Mastered by: Cam Murdoch\nCover Art: Jamee Cornelia\n",
