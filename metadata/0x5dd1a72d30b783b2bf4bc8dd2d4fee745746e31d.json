    "description": "Close your eyes.\n\nIn pixels dim and screens askew,  \nA digital revolution brews.  \nColours fade and shadows loom,  \nA world of darkness, a digital gloom.\n\nGone are the days of light and hope,  \nA world of despair now helps us cope.  \nA spectrum dark, a monochrome hue,  \nA burst of shadows, all we can construe.\n\nThe digital age has changed the way,  \nWe see and interact with the world today.  \nColours now fade, and life seems grim,  \nIn ways we never dreamed of, trapped within.\n\nSo let us embrace the shadows and shades,  \nOf this new world that humans have made.  \nFor in this digital age, darkness reigns,  \nAnd our world will never be the same.",
