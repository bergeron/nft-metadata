    "description": "This Monument was built to pay tribute to the people of Khor Fakkan who resisted the Portuguese invasion of 1507. Where other towns surrendered immediately, Khor Fakkanâ€™s brave people resisted for two days against the Portuguese forces who were equipped with fire arms\n.\nThis monument resembles a Warriors Helmet as a symbol of resistance situated on a prominent hill in Khor Fakkan. The shape and the height it was built mesmerized me to take this in Black and white and edit in Fine art photography style in LR/PS.\n\n\nArtist:  Kiran Govind \nNikon D850 & Nikon 14-24mm F2.8\n7501X 5000 , 2.6 MB\nDate of Capture 20/12/2021\nLocation: Sharjah, UAE\n\n",
