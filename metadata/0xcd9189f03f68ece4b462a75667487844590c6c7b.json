    "description": "A code-generated kinetic work, Sift creates an illusion of a shifting pattern. Each pixel is treated like a small entity of color, movement and feeling, softly blending into another one. \n\nGradations ,lines. and radiating waves are not drawn, but emerge by virtue of a “color by number by time” method; each pixel is assigned a color modulus which oscillates at the same rate at a repeatable mathematical pattern. Color switching at a pixel level creates all the motion in Sift.  A high-energy sine wave causes the gritty texture of the fragments. \n\nMeticulously hand-tuned by the artist, the coloring math has been adjusted for each piece to produce the desired contrast and depth. Subdivisions of brightness and saturation were chosen for a softer feel, inviting the viewer to sift through and notice small emergent elements.\n",
