    "description": "\"To Infinity and Beyond\" was my first 1/1 NFT Photography collection which got SOLD OUT last year.\n\nOne year after that amazing moment in my photography career, I decided to add a fresh new photograph to the collection, but this time it's a single photograph in an edition of 70/70.\n\n===\n\n\"So many kilometers driven, so many sleepless nights, so many hours editing... This is a collection of images I created to appreciate night sky, to appreciate the pure joy of gazing into the Infinity and Beyond!\"\n\n(The startrail is created from a single image to give the photograph unique scenery)\n\n===\n\nArtist: Asef Azi\n\nCollection: To Infinity and Beyond\n\nEdition: Limited to 70\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
