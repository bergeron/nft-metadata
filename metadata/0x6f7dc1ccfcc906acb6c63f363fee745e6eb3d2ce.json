    "description": "This is a spot I love to shoot from, with the in-coming and out-going tide it reveals it's secrets slowly. \n\nOn this particular morning I was waiting for the tide to roll in a little more to cover more of the rocks that lead the line up and out to the horizon. On this morning however, I was also graced with the presence of two fishermen out on the peninsula.\n\nAs the tide rolled in more and I was pushed back further from this spot, the fishermen stayed steadfast in their position. It wasn't until this whole area was nearly covered back up by the ocean that they probably decided they were pushing their luck and it might be time to pack up. I must say I did breath a sigh of relief when they did. \n\nI left when they got closer to me, just in case!",
