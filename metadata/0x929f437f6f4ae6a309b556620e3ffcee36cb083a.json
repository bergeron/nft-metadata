    "description": "Düsseldorf, Germany 2018 - On the lively Rheinuferpromenade between the old town and the Rhein river in Düsseldorf, the day awoke with a cloud swallowing the city whole. Often crowded with the chatter of the city, it suddenly felt like a ghost town, with none but a lone traveler and his hovering birds. While capturing this photo, there was an exhilaration that gave me a sense of freedom and release. The trees aligned themselves to make space to leave the weight of the mundane behind. \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
