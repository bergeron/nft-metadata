    "description": "This photo is a part of a diptych: \"Interlacing\".\nThe part: “BLACK” \n\nOur life is woven from tangled threads, good and evil side by side in it. Where the end of good is the beginning of evil, and where the end of evil is the beginning of good. Joy and sorrow, knowledge and ignorance, good and evil go hand in hand with each other.\nThere is nothing absolute. Life is good in its duality.",
