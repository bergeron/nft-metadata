    "description": "I LOST MY MIND.I am terrified by this dark thing, that sleeps in my mind. But i still found a way to sew broken end that never ends, or may have never began, all i do is to lose myself in the shadows that have left behind. It's seems to me that today my forest is dark, trees are sad and butterflies have broken wings.\n\nPhoto was shot on  foggy morning. As I was shooting the headless man photo series from last year project. I got the idea of using that tree in the background to get something different. also I got lucky to have that bird in the frame. \n\nPS : No photoshop involves. \n\nArtist : Adnan_Dani\n\nLicense \nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
