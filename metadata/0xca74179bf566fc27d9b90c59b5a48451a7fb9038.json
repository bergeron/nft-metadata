    "description": "Miami 1984 is a pioneering art project exploring the boundaries between real and virtual worlds. A considerable amount of time in our lives is spent navigating virtual worlds, engaging with artificial characters, and immersing ourselves in digital stories. Miami 1984 is an artificial photography project reviving memories and creating new narratives. If virtual experiences have the power to evoke strong emotions, should they not be considered real?",
