    "description": "Somehow the world in front of me is always this kind of colors.\n\nSince I was very young, I always have so many questions which are against the society's opinions.\n\n\"Shut the f*** up, you weird kid! How dare you doubt in our lord!? You must be thankful in his kindness that he allowed you to live in his town!\"\n\n\"His town? But we're citizens of this town too. Doesn't it mean we're all sharing the ownership?\"\n\n\"You're disgusting! If you don't respect our lord, just get away from his town or I'll report you to the IIZ to put you into the jail!\"\n\nThe conversations always end up like this. Even though I have questions about many unfair rules which everyone need to follow, I've never received any answer but threat.\n\nYou can't think different from others here. If you have no loyalty to 'the lord', it's mean you're risking your life dealing with a powerful organization called 'IIZ'\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nWhenever I look up at the sky, I always whisper to myself silently...\n\n\"I'd rather die than accept this\"",
