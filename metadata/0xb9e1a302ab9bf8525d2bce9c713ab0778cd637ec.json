    "description": "H.01: 2022, video frames, polyptych.  \nHORIZON 2022 SERIES\n\nThe project HORIZON reflects on the variable states of the water phenomenon through a pictorial representation of the ever-changing wraps and ripples of form and space.  \nThe series originated in 2019 with compositions of post-produced and assembled still images derived from video recordings of various water landscapes. The video recordings were captured spontaneously while swimming, with a camera attached to my head or chest.  \nThe virtual presentation represents the works in a digital model of studio space. Each image stands on a backlighted transparent canvas mounted on a frame.",
