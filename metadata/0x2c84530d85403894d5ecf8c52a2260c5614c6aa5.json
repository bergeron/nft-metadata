    "description": "We climbed the mountain for five hours and made a bivouac before the glacier climb, 700 meters below the summit.\n Around 02:30 a.m., we got up to prepare the mountain gear and the photographic equipment, and to rope up before climbing the glacier in total darkness.\nA few hours and 680 meters later, after climbing through ice and crevasses, we arrived to the final climb with the first glow of sunlight.\nThe sun was rising as we climbed towards the summit. The clouds, the mountains, the snow and our smiley faces were all painted by the warm colour of the first rays that touched this part of the Earth. \n I set the tripod, camera, and decided the composition. One… two… three shoots and that was all. Only a few minutes of that beatifull light captured for the eternity.\n\nImage from the summit of Cerro Eléctrico, El Chaltén.\n15 of February, 2021.\n\nFile size: 5.505 x 3.725 px at 300dpi.\n\n\"Gloria\" means \"Glory\".",
