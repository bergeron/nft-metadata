    "description": "\"L OS FLEXION\" a cyberpunk reality\n\n\"Flexion is the action of bending or the condition of being bent, especially the bending of a limb or joint.\"\n ~ The Oxford English Dictionary\n\nIn this X-ray image, there are two pen markings on the lumbar disc slip area. The slip worsened, so pain traveled all the way down the left leg and left foot, making it impossible to walk until the sciatic nerve is wiggled out of the pinch. Shock from pain causes crying and cold clamminess of the skin, such as the feeling before fainting. These immobility moments led to this doctor visit where steroid epidural injections were considered for that day, but due to general muscle strength, 2-3x per week and 4 weeks of physical therapy were prescribed again with a recommendation to take more Tylenol.\n\nX-RAY: V is a black and white still NFT in a 9:16 ratio. All sales from the series will go towards chiropractic, orthopedic, physical therapy, and radiologic technician costs for bitpixi. \"Thanks for\nhaving my back!\"",
