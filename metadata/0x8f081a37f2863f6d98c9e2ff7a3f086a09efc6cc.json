    "description": "Companion art for the essay, “The Western Mappa Mundi: Toward a Subject-oriented Concept of Reality.” \n\nRead the essay on Tezos at the link.\n\nEXCERPT:\n\nMedieval maps didn’t depict the geographical landscape; they depicted the mental landscape. At the center (i.e. “true, pure, good”) was the Church of Rome. The further you got from the center of Papal authority, the more monstrous and deformed people became.\n\nFalse, evil, bad. Low or no value.\n\nWe still think this way. At that time in the Western world, the Roman Church, and its worldview, was the objective standard of truth, purity, and goodness. The further one diverged from this standard, the more monstrous one became. The Statue of David is the epitome of this standard. The perfect being. The perfect human. The perfection of God.\n\n\n—----\n\nArt made in collaboration with DreamStudio.AI.",
