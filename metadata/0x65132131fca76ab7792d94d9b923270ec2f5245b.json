    "name": "The Slide",
    "description": "This is one of the earlier charcoal drawings I did for Chinman. The slide used to be down the hill from my childhood home, and it had a very haunting quality about it. It used to scare me, especially at night. I could see it from my bedroom window and the flickering globe light which sat on the top. Before we moved out of that house, the playground was swallowed up by a sinkholeâ€”the whole thing. No lie. I remember coming home from school one day, and it was all roped off. I started having dreams about Chinman more and more often. He waited at the bottom of the slide.\n\nThe slide is a significant part of the story.\n\n________\n\nThe Chinman collection is based on a reoccurring childhood nightmare, the real-world events that helped trigger it, and the profound impact it has had on my life. Chinman is an ongoing, multifaceted project, which will include a graphic novel and an adaptation for TV and Film. The NFT sales will contribute to the further development of this project.",
