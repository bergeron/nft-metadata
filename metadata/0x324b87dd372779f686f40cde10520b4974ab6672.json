    "description": "“The Beauty of Remoteness” is an audiovisual masterpiece crafted by the award-winning astrophotographer Noel Thomas in collaboration with the 18 year-old music producer Orum Palmer. Timelapse and music come together harmoniously to convey the beauty of the Milky Way Galaxy as well as the beauty on our planet despite being a remote place in the universe, just like deserts on earth. Beauty can emerge even in the most remote places. \n\nThis was filmed deep in the Mojave Desert, California on a moonless night above the sand dunes. Reaching this location required hiking for hours after sunset to trek its sand peaks which are over 1,000 feet high. The star light seen here took 26,000 years to reach Earth. At the center is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A.\n\nCaptured using the latest night camera technology and long exposure techniques with a wide color gamut.\n\nThe owner of this NFT will also receive the original piece in 4K UHD resolution and the WAV (32 bit-float) audio file.",
