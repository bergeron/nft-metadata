    "description": "The window is metaphor for hope, change, and step into the unknown. We all expiriance this in life.\n\nMany windows represent how different individuals look at the world and things in different way (different colors).\n\nEach frame is darket and darker. Means we are going forward and we are more and more clear (life, thoughts, opinionetc.) about everything around us. \n\nThe frames are not perfect, there are some deviations. First and second window at bottom left corner, third and fourth bottom left corner. The main window is yours, there is also deviation from left side. This means that our opinion and thoughts on anything can not be right or wrong there is always something more. We need search for more and more answers. \n\nI play with idea and pixels for three months, so do not expect another artwork soon. \n\nThe image can be use in your universe home, project or at your home. Be creative!\n\n\nI hope you like it.\n\n\nPeace!\n\n\n\n",
