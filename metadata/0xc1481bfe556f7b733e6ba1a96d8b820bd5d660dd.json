    "description": "Born in the abyss of salt chuck,\nBeauty did bend to me \nLike the rainbow o'er the meadows\nSoaked by an uneven shower.\n\nThe henchmen of Orpheus sang for me,\nLike my golden locks,\nThat danced to the tumult\nOf the chilly ocean breeze..\n\n'She's the incarnation of beauty', they shouted;\nThe glimmer in my deep blue eyes\nHeld the key to the undertows,\nLike the gush of the spring on the cherry trees.\n\nBut little did I know,\nThat my ethos was just another myth.\nA meritless sigh in the face of force.\nAnd I, an object of a moment's thrill.!\n\nToday I'm no longer an equivalent of charm.\nThese temple walls, they are no longer my sanctuary.\nToday, betwixt my fangs and lolling tongues,\nI feel the slither & hiss of my mane.\n\nMy voluptuous gaze, 'tis is no more.\nI am just another petrifying critter.!\nDescendants shall only know me for the beast I am,\nNever for the sacrifices, frailty and allure. ..",
