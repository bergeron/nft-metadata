    "description": "Ahmed’s musical beginnings were simple, starting with an acoustic guitar and any place to write his thoughts. He is a multifaceted talent with a palette of different creative crafts, being well-versed as a vocalist, producer, musician, songwriter, and audio engineer. He releases original music as part of OK! (@findokmusic), a musical duo as well as an individual artist. Ahmed seamlessly blends his skillset with sound to craft captivating alternative-pop, R&B, and electronic compositions. He infuses his music with the rich cultural influences of his South Asian heritage, adding a worldly touch that sets his sound apart.\n\nThis song is about being drawn to someone or something even though it may not be the best choice for oneself. This may not mean the situation is necessarily bad, but more so speaks to the part of you that knows it isn’t exactly the best thing for you. Experiencing this blissful feeling can be conflicting because deep down you are aware that it is not a sustainable situation. It also may not always feel like it makes sense to challenge this feeling, especially when it provides momentary joy, peace, and happiness. But sometimes we get lost within someone or something and fall in love with comfortability rather than the thing itself.",
