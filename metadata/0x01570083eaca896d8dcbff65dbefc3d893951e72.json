    "description": "Never have I had a steady place to call home - as in a physical structure shaped like a house or something. Maybe an apartment. A big part of my journey has always entailed moving, a lot. Why, I don't really know because there are always many reasons but it's left me curious as to what other people see as home in America. \n\nThis image is the introduction to an upcoming series that chronicles the exteriors of places that have peaked my curiosity. Some which I actually stayed in temporarily and others I've admired from afar. It might be pervasive, or just voyeuristic. I'm good with either. \n\nThe details within the images focus on light and shadow above all - a common theme in my work of photo and film. Photography is a tool and a passion I don't often advertise - to me, it is a form of capturing a still so that I can keep it in my pocket for reference. \n\nDetails:\nImage Size - 8533 x 5687\nRes - 300 x 300",
