    "description": "35 MM FILM CONVERTED TO 4K VIDEO minted on the Ethereum blockchain NFT, edition of 2. The title of this non-fungible token (NFT) is identical to the final sentence spoken by Tilda Swinton in Lynn Hershman Leesonâ€™s film Conceiving Ada (1995). This visionary film about the legacy of Ada Lovelace, a mathematician who wrote the very first computer program in the nineteenth century, was made nearly thirty years ago but resonates today with the idea of NFTs. Each generation recreates itself with the technological means of its time. Today, we witness a revolution based on artificial intelligence, NFTs, and DNA becoming the driving force of a new language for storage and communication.",
