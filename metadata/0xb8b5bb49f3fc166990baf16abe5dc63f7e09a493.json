Hair ma-ta-peehee key tore-ku why-roo-ah\n\nAnxiety, sadness, fear and doubt. \nEmotions I know too well. \nNeither friend nor foe, they are the cell mates that share this lonely room with me, existing only to hold me in a place I once was, a feeling, I once had.\n\nThey blanket me, weighted down under a sea of darkness, they keep me here, imprisoned in my own head, hands pushing down upon my shoulders.\n\nI need air. \nOpen the window.\n\nKo taku NFT tuatahi tenei\nThis is my very first NFT",
