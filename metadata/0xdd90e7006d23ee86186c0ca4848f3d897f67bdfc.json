Equanimity is a state of calm and stability that enables us to live with an open heart, unconditionally; detached while embracing both the good and bad that permeates our physical life experience. Equanimity Abodes aim to help residents embody this state with ease.  \n____________________________________________________________  \nAI-assisted architectural art",
