    "description": "KEKCHAOS is a kind of organized chaos capturing a period of time in 2022-2023 when many pioneers of the digital arts added to the story of Pepe the frog by taking over the space with Pepe Meme Art and the tsunami that brought in the birth of Modern Memism, which many believe the artist Batzdu is the father of.  From Jack Butler's Checks to VVDs' Notables and the chaos that the $PEPE coin brought, this was a special time that is still being written. Not only capturing a period of time in the space of web3 digital arts, this piece holds some truth of the culture happening recently. It was created to conjure thoughts of the origins of Pepe and the truth of the many false narratives around the most infamous meme on planet Earth.",
