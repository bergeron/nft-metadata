    "description": "She has been in many places, has seen many things, heard and learned a lot from different people. Being a nomad isn't a problem for Mako. In fact, she enjoys wandering here and there. She's very compassionate towards elderly people and orphans.\nDespite her warm character, Mako is a hired assassin that is known for her agility and brutal execution, a few traits imbued by her Seishin, a celestial White Tiger.\nJust one knock at her door plus a good amount of gold, and she's ready to pounce.\n\n\n[2160 x 3840 px]",
