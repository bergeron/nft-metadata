    "description": "Sneakerheads rejoice!\n\nImagine a future where custom designed shoes are easily available to all. Everyone may have their own 1/1 shoe. Enjoy Star Wars or Marvel? Have a special design applied to your shoe. Maybe you prefer horror films. Your shoes can fit that, too. Anything you can image can be applied to your shoe. Also, there are custom socks. Not just to match or complement the shoes but socks that can take a life all their own.\n\nFor now, we dream. We love shoes and technology and NFTs and crypto. These 2,250 NFTs are imaginings of that future. There is something for everyone but still the future is limitless. The ideas here are just the start.\n\nThese are custom graphics applied to models of existing shoes. This is no different from the artists who paint shoes or embellish any item. All rights remain with the appropriate rights-holders. Rights-holders did not approve any of these designs or affiliated with them in any way. These designs are available for remixing under CC0 terms.",
