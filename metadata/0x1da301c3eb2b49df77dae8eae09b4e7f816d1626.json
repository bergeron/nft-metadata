You can’t be a successful entrepreneur if you don’t enjoy life and live it to the fullest. I get my dopamine from inspiring others in how to be better business people, friends, and relatives.\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to see how people I mentored and supported go far in life. They often call me a “motivator” or an “inspiring leader”, but it’s actually the opposite - I get my energy from those around me. Interaction with others is like an idea generator for me, it helps me grow and flourish.\n\nWhen it comes to business, I rarely listen to anyone but myself. I trust my gut instinct. When you have an exciting business idea, 99% of people will tell you what might go wrong and why it won’t work. That’s why 99% of people suck at being successful entrepreneurs. My mantra is \"Screw it, let's do it”. Brilliance needs confidence to shine.\n\nFor me, business needs to be fun and adventurous, it has to inspire those around me and delight my customers. Nothing excites me like taking my team on the most challenging of business journeys and achieving things that inspire the world and make history.\n",
