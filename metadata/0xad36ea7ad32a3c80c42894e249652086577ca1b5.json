    "description": "The eyes are the light portal of the inner power, like a fiery tiger, it catches fire and in one moment pulls you inside and surprises you. The power of its flames is great. The tiger is a symbol of the ruler of the physical world. It is the five senses. Everything that exists in life is visible in the tiger's eyes. Is. The focused fire and lightning of the tiger's eye attracts us to the presence of a momentary event in the ultimate peace of the fire's warmth.\ndigital painting\nsize: 2953*4134px\nResolution: 300 DPI\n",
