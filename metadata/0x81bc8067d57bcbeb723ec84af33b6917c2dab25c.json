    "description": "This photo is named as \"The Golden Snake in the city\", because there was a golden snake lantern in the Singapore city in the year 2013, which was the year of the snake in accordance to the Chinese 12 Zodiac Signs. \n\nThis photo was created during the Chinese New Year season in the year 2013, and the multiple long exposures were made. Post processing was done to generate high dynamic range effect to the final photo. It was in my vision to create this image back in 2013, but it was only recently that this photo was named. \n\nCrypto Space, metaverse and photography united together.\n\nThank you to my friend, Ernest who invited me to the Foundation, so that my creation(s) can be a part of this incredible space. \n",
