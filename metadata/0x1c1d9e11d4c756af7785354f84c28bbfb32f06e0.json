    "description": "2022 | The journey starts here. \n\nFirst part of The Island collection. Created with Cinema 4D and rendered in Octane. It tells a story about a lone robot and his pet drone who embark on a journey to find traditional values and the simplicity in life, in a world that has become to complex.\n\nThe original clip has music and sound effects to them, though it doesn't seem audible in the clip here at Foundation.
