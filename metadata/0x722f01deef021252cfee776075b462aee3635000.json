    "description": "Artist: Raphaële Bidault-Waddington, 2023. \nDim: 2362 x 3150 px.  Edition of 3.\nThis NFT comes with a right to print the image.\n\nFollowing the datadeluge tsunami, the world had become a fully immersed world of images… Images were literally flowing everywhere, finding ways of creating fluid habitats, living spaces and submerged meta-cities. Each had their own ambience…\n\nAs a conceptual artist with a hybrid background, Raphaële Bidault-Waddington creates art labs to explore aesthetically critical contemporary issues. \nHer photomontages made with hundreds of photographs she takes around the world, make us feel how the digital transition and its overload of images, have abstracted our lives into a strange, dis-located and fluid data-sphere. In this climate, she invites us to find poetry and develop a form of kinship with images.\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rbidaultwaddington/)\n",
