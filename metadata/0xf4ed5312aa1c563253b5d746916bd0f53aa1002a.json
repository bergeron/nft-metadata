    "description": "The \"Dark Magic Queen\" artwork are representated one of the Bali (Indonesia) Mythology titled 'Calon Arang'. \n\nIn the mythology itself  'Calon Arang' known as a woman who becomes the greatest black magic ruler by making a pact with a demon. \n\nHowever, apart from the crime of Calon Arang who became out of control of his power, if we dig deeper into the story, we will find out another literature which is explained about a reason behind Calon Arang decision to study black magic until she is crowned as the Queen of black magic.  \nIt said Calon Arang was the victim of  the harshness of women's lives in that era which was dominated by patriarchy and gender power under the society system. \n\nThis, of course, becomes a dillematic chain when a victim of injustice who fights with her new power just ended up being a devastator for another people life.  \nThe story were teaches us to always treat anyone in equal and not to let bad intention take over our mind even if it's a good reason to fight for.\n\n\nArya Wirawan  \nNovember 16 2022",
