    "description": "A step back to appreciate life.\n\nI made this artwork after almost 1 Â½ year of the COVID pandemic. A pandemic that haven't been kind to anybody. In retrospection, it has been a very difficult time but also a time of creativity for me. 8 months ago I decided to start an artistic journey, even though I had no experience in this field. This is my first NFT representing the balanced life that I seek.\n\nI saw many suffering and real joyful moments during the past year, and this is what life is all about; balance and cycle.\n\n2K square image.\nThe color can be retouched as pleased.\nI want this artwork to be a shared project with the collector, come talk to me, if you please ðŸ™‚.",
