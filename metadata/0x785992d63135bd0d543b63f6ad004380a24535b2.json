    "description": "Frozen in Time is No. 1 in my genesis 1/1 NFT series \"Emerge”. \n\nThe series consists of four unique pieces, taking you on a visual journey of water and light while venturing across the Arctic. \"Emerge” looks back on pivotal moments in my photography career, with each image having a profound impact on the way I shoot. The series reflects the path of self-discovery that we take as artists, putting everything on the line, crafting a style over time and finding our voices in the creative sphere.\n\nBeginning in a world of towering ice structures in West Greenland, you will see me standing amidst an environment so far from what I knew growing up in Australia, a place that now feels like home. A glacial world that rests still, frozen by the extreme Arctic winter conditions above an 800m deep fjord. It signifies the internal calling that draws us back to certain places, leading us to feel a new and often unexpected sense of home in the process.\n\nEdition 1 of 1\n\n3000 x 2400px",
