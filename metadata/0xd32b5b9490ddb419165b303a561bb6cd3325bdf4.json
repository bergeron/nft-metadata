    "description": "This artwork, created with the use of AI technology is inspired by the AI Controversy at Artstation. In it we see a robot artist forlorn that they are being shunned by the artists community, sitting infront of an AI protest image. \n\nThe AI protest in December 20222, sparked by illustrator Nicholas Kole and costume designer Imogen Chayes uses the same image, originally created by Alexander Nanitchkov and saying “No To AI Generated Images,” has garnered a lot of attention. We see this same image that has taken over the internet on the artists' easel. \n\nThe artist in the painting is surrounded by traditional tools of the trade like paint brushes and canvases, but they are spurned and abandoned while the AI logo is turned into a flag of rebellion. The sense of loneliness and rejection the artist feels is palpable and the colors of the painting add to the feeling of sadness and despair. \n\nThe painting speaks to the fear in the artistic community that AI will eventually replace them and their work, but also to the hope that this is not the case. By depicting the artist's forlorn stance, it gives voice to the struggles of the artist in an ever-changing world.\n\n---  \nArtwork by KUSH",
