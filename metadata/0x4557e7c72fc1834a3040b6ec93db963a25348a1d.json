    "description": "My second offering from the lost album, OG COOL. (Only Good Comes Out Of Living)\n\nThis is the second song that I have brought to Web3 that I produced and I'm extremely proud of that. Although this was created some time ago, it serves as a reminder to me never to limit any part of myself. I'm here to operate as my highest and fullest self at all times.\n\nThere's en entendre in there for all of my herb specialists. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nWith Love,\nOG\n\nWritten, Produced, Performed, Mixed (BARELY! lol) & Mastered By Scolla Fungwe\nArtwork By Scolla Fungwe\nGuitar By Nash B\n",
