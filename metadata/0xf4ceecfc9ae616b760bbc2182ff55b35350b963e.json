    "description": "Chapter 4:  \nThe Block  \nMay, 2022 - Planet \"Earth\"\n\nA old message from the Ancient Astronauts was found recently talking about a \"mysterious cube\" (original word also interpreted and adopted as \"block\" by  the Mr.Swe's Labs recently). \nIt seems the block is moving and fluctuating in the middle of a strong magnetic field.  \nExternal and unknown forces are acting, destabilizing the original trajectory. \n\nWe are going to investigate also the message and the frequencies it was spreading along the way.\n\nEarly observations suggests are positive vibrations and we need to go in depth to understand the further implication of it.\n\nNobody know when the block starts his journey, only few in the universe know what message his carrying.",
