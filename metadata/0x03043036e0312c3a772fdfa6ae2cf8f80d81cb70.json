    "description": "Vayu is a female deity in Iranian mythology, equivalent to Zeus in Greek mythology. She is the goddess of the sky, wind, rain, and ruler of the earth. In this portrayal, the woman is depicted with clouds in her basket, defying typical advertising clich√©s of a mundane shopper. She exudes immense power, as she is shown moving the clouds and reigning over the earth.\n\nDigital art 4800 x 3480 px",
