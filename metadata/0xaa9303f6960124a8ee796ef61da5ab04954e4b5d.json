    "name": "Grand Sunset",
    "description": "Taken in 2017 on the south rim of the Grand Canyon. My wife and I drove to Desert View on a rainy day hoping to catch a sunset but our hopes were low. The rain stopped when we got there but it was too cloudy and about to rain again. In the end it meant we were the only people that drove out to the spot.  The cloud formations were spectacular and the sun started to peak through low, but bright, with the some rain over the mountains in the distance. The silhouettes of the cliffs really pop with the sun coming from behind the clouds. ",
