    "description": "Zen art does not try to create the illusion of reality. It abandons true to life perspective, and works with artificial space relations which make one think beyond reality into the essence of reality. This concept of essence as opposed to illusion is basic to Zen art in all phases.\n\nThe basic premise that the highest truth is not expressible in words or conceivable through logical thought, and this is called enlightenment.\n\nArtwork Spec :\n8200px X 4300px\n300 dpi\nedition : 1/1",
