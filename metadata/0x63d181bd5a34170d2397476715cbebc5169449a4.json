    "description": "I had the opportunity to visit the amazing property of renowned Mexican architect Javier Senosiain. The structure entitled \"El Nido de Quetzalcóatl\" .The main body of Quetzalcóatl, is an iridescent color; golden emerald that combines with a deep violet blue, like the feathers of the quetzal. The cosmic serpent that establishes a mediation between heaven and earth.\n\nI chose to edit the image in this way because I want the viewer to see it how I see it now, as a memory of a dream. The grounds are so fantastical that even now I don't fully believe I was really there. \n\nI entitled this \"Venom also Cures\" because I've always found it ironic that the cure for snake bites is often in the venom. A beautiful irony which is often the theme of life many paradoxes.  ",
