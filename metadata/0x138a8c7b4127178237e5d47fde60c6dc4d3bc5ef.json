    "description": "I decided to name this piece Sophrosyne because this was my state of mind at the time of making this piece. Sophrosyne is an ancient Greek term that refers to a deep awareness of oneâ€™s true self. \n\nAs you can see, the atmosphere is a little dark and gloomy. Still, the Lotus remains as beautiful as ever. The shadow represents a person's shadow self.\n\n\nThe Lotus flower is a symbol of enlightenment and rebirth. The Lotus is resilient and can even purify the water they live in. The characteristics of the Lotus is an excellent analogy to Nature and the Human Spirit. In essence, the Lotus flower is Sophrosyne. \n\n7000 x 5000 \nMade in Houdini FX & Redshift.",
