    "description": "Sometimes we have to face our darkest thoughts before we can really move beyond them. We did that together with HEAVEN - Reo and I made this song right after we finished his Diary of a Loner album…we were locked in and had been creating together regularly for nearly a full year and were both itching to try something different. I sent him an instrumental inspired by acoustic singer-songwriters and he replied with the start of this heartwrenching song that soon revealed itself as one of the most vulnerable either of us had ever made. \n \nReo and I bonded over the traumatic health issues and subsequent surgeries we both went through during the pandemic that seriously limited us for too long. Heaven looks that feeling of hopelessness we both felt straight in the eyes and in the end finds a glimmer of hope in it. Hope that we both found with each other as we deepened our creative partnership during that time. We’ve never heard anything quite like it.\n\nThis is song 1 from CACOPHONY, a new project from Reo Cragun and myself. CACOPHONY is a beautiful explosion. Deafeningly loud and chaotic and intimate at the same time. And it begins now.\n",
