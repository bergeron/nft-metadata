    "name": "The Glass House",
    "description": "There is a place where anything is possible. Things that only exist within our imagination, the Metaverse. Within those possibilities is The Glass House, an ideal reality. Designed with passion and care, this extraordinary piece of Architecture and Art is a mystery and a reality. The concept used only 4 elements of nature. Glass and metal to make the structure of the house, water, and fire as the elements of life.\n \nDespite its extraordinary look, minimalistic design, and its distinctive structure, the house can possibly be built in the real world. Space arrangement and furniture have also been thought to present a real-life residential home.  It is also equipped with some other art works of the same artist decorated throughout the building.\n\nThe Glass House as an NFT will include hidden features that will be given to the Collector. These include 3D assets and a higher resolution video of the house.\n\nCredits: \n\nMusic:\n1. Yoga Style by Chris Haugen\n2. Walk into Paradise by Carmen Mar√≠a.",
