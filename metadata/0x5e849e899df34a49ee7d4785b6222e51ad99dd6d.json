    "description": "He's the regular trooper of the Sopholux clan. Although this might sound like average, rest assured that there is nothing ordinary about this imposing creature. Versatility being his special trait, he can be equipped in virtually any thinkable configuration, be it in terms of weapons, armor, or special attachments. Having hundreds of brothers-in-arms to choose from, he mostly operates in small squads perfectly adapted to the mission.",
