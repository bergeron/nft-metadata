    "description": "Angels of AC5SHOT \n\nAngels of AC5SHOT a collection of 1000 uniquely generated NFTâ€™S featuring beautifully designed digital art pieces that showcase powerful and mysterious angelic beings. The Angels ascended through the magic of ai up scaling and detailing.\n\nWhat do you get from an Angel of AC5SHOT ? \n\nAll ANGELS OF AC5SHOT holders will receive a airdrop from every future project that I create , starting with AC5SHOT ASSASSINS. At a near future date once ANGELS OF AC5SHOT has generated enough to cover the cost of minting AC5SHOT ASSASSINS, I will announce on my twitter when a snapshot will be taken and all who hold a ANGEL OF AC5SHOT at the time of snapshot will receive a AC5SHOT ASSASSIN airdropped to their account.\n\nStarting from the date of reveal for 100 days each day a random Angel holder will receive a hand drawn artwork from my upcoming daily series.\n\nThe whole ANGELS OF AC5SHOT collection is centered and created around rewarding loyal supporters of the collection, as well as always providing future value to holders. Furthermore, the Angels of AC5SHOT collection is just the beginning of an exciting future for all in the community. \n\nI AC5SHOT am here to stay.",
