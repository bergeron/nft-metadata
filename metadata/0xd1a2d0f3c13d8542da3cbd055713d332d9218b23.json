    "description": "On day 182 the sky turned to gray, down fell the rain and everything grew dark as the shadows descended from the dreary light of what was. As darkness washed over, my heart fell into a bottomless pit of emptiness. \n\nOn day 181 I was exactly where I was supposed to be. Coexisting with growth, heightening the culture of being present from day to day, making goose bumps last as long as I could, and fueling my heart with the fiery passion that makes me feel alive. On this day I was reminiscing on my travels thus far. The good, the bad, the mornings I didn’t want to wake up and the nights I didn’t want to end. \n\nIn the the blink of an eye, the morning of 182, everything i’ve ever worked for was taken from me. Every piece of my camera equipment was stolen, and more importantly everything I use to support myself. My world was flipped upside down.\n\nOn day 183, the sky may still be gray and everything may be screaming, but I will find my way because my heart is still beating.",
