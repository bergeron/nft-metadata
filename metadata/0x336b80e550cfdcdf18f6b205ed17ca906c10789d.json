    "description": "Food and love is expressed by crayfish. They are the aquatic animals which are closest to human posture when they are in love, and they are pure and unswerving. The story of cowherd and weaver girl is the earliest romantic love legend about the \"Star\" in China. Although they can meet at the \"magpie bridge\" only once a year, they have been silently guarding each other on both sides of the Milky. Every year, the seventh day of July in Chinese lunar calendar, also known as \"Double Seventh Festival\", has also become the Chinese version of \"Valentine's Day\".",
