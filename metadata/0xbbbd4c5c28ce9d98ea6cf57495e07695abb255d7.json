    "description": "Stricken by a surprise snowfall in London in the year of 2022 in December. I managed to capture a couple who were lucky enough to be protected by their umbrella.\n\nOn this day I decided to take my camera to work and go out shooting afterwards in the night, lucky for me it started to snow which changed everything! I got so excited that I was lucky enough to have my camera on me to capture shots that are most likely going to happen once in a blue moon especially in the UK. \n\nI wanted to capture a potential cinematic shot that  I believe I succeeded with. I was walking around London with no plan in mind of what I was going to capture, I was able to adapt and act last minute to capture a frame of what I had in mind.",
