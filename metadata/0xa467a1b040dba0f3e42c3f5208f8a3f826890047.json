    "description": "Shadow Moon is an ex-convict who is caught up in the war between the Old Gods and the New Gods when Mr. Wednesday hires him as a bodyguard. As they journey across America, Shadow finds himself questioning a world where gods exist and magic is real.\r\n\r\n\"You know, I don't really believe any of this. And maybe everything that's happened so far is just some kind of vivid dream. And I don't even know if I can believe that.\" - Shadow Moon",
