    "description": "Photograph. Republic Bolivariana de Venezuela 50; B27674044. (2018)   Antonio José de Sucre was a close friend of revolutionary Simón de Bolivar, and like him, de Sucre was a member of the European aristocracy who played a role in Venezuelan independence. Both de Sucre (1975-1830) and de Bolivar (1783-1830) were contemporaries of George Washington, whose visage would become synonymous with the US dollar, to which the Venezuelan bolivares has been pegged since 2008.\n\n\tSwollen with oil reserves, Venezuela had become one of the wealthiest countries in the Americas during the 1960s. But beginning in the early 1980s through 1990s, inflation slowly began to wreak havoc on the economy, along with fluctuating oil prices and unstable political systems. The rates of inflation became so accelerated under President Nicolas Maduro, that in 2018, the year this bill was printed, the government stopped providing statistics, with estimates ranging from 33,000 to as high as 1,000,000% by the IMF.\n",
