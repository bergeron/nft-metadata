    "description": "There is a form of joy and power that comes with kindness, and this you see in the way people in the NFT space are willing to uncover themselves just to make sure that someone, a complete stranger, does not feel left out or hung out to dry. Often times, it is very unconcious, and this is the most part that reveals the humanity of a person. \nThis space has taught me much about giving light to someone. Lighting anotherÂ´s lamp cannot cause mine to quench. \nWho we are is God's gift to us, and the best part of this gift comes with how we use it to change someone else's life. What we use this gift to do, becomes our own gift to God. Kindness, I would love to think, is a form of making gods, causing the sparks we have ignited in people to ignite more.",
