    "description": "This is a Steller's sea eagle flying over an ice floe, photographed in Hokkaido.\nIt is the largest eagle in Japan, and its wingspan is spectacular.\nI like this shot very much because it looks as if it is flying toward the morning glow and the drift ice in the background is impressive.",
