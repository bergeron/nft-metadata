    "description": "The primary focus of my work revolves around the creation of AI-generated images utilizing the Midjourney program. In this endeavor, I strive to fashion an alternate reality where individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds are depicted in locations that have historically been devoid of such diversity. My inspiration for this project came about while experimenting with AI and discovering that certain prompts would result in images featuring only a narrow range of individuals, despite never having specified such limitations. For instance, I noticed that the algorithm would never incorporate black people into the Swiss Alps landscapes, even though I had not specifically excluded them. Therefore, my objective is to utilize AI to create a more inclusive and diverse representation of reality that accurately reflects the world we live in.",
