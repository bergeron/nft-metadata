    "name": "The wine is just not enough",
    "description": "In the stillness of a bathtub overrun with blooms,\nI float atop the surface of my tumultuous thoughts.\nA glass of wine, a fleeting solace from my wounds,\nAnd a bottle, a reminder of my self-destructive knots.\n\nThe girl in the water, a reflection of my soul,\nSurrounded by the vines of emotions uncontrolled.\nA time of darkness, of loneliness and pain,\nOf feelings of inadequacy, thoughts that drive me insane.\n\nThis piece is a testimony of a heart once torn,\nOf a journey through the shadows, a battle to be born.\nA vulnerable confession of the demons I have faced,\nOf the emptiness that once consumed me, now replaced.\n\nIt's a part of my collection, called \"Into You\",\nAn ode to introspection, a journey of self-pursuit.\nA tale of growth, of hope, and of resilience,\nA reminder that the beauty in the darkness can be immense.",
