    "description": "This heavenly light shows down upon the Manhattan Beach Pier between thunderstorms. \n\nJust as it had been written thousands of years ago…the legends foretold of a Pierfect day in October. Thunder, Lightning, followed by a golden light that would bring a great swell to Los Angeles. So it has been written so it shall be. \n\nOf the 20 years I've lived here and 15 of those years as a professional photographer taking photos of the Pier, I have never seen it like this. These unique and special moments are exactly what I point to when I'm asked \"How can you take so many photos of the same place?\". It is never the same place, always changing with the angle of the sun, the direction and intensity of the swell, the Pier People who inhabit it.\n\nMy Genesis SuperRare Series image begins our journey and your opportunity to give into Pier Pressure.",
