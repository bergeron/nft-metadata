    "description": "Dino Babies in Space is the animated action-comedy series from the mind of Matt Bolinger. The Brasco Space Pirates are the main antagonists in the series and a core feature of the on-chain idle game “Egg Game.” By staking a pirate you raid another egg holder daily. The more eggs you have, the more votes you have in the production process of the animated series. We’re excited to have you join us as we create the next great action space comedy.",
