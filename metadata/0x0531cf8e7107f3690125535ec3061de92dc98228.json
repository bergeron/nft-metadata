The SlugEye project emerged as a non-judgmental vision, revisiting a time when creating without barriers was the craziest adventure: childhood.@_Byron_b decided to emerge and create from the vision of children, exploring their ingenuity and barrier-free creativity, understanding how they see the world, and translating it into the creation of a collection of NFTs.Each unique NFT is the fruit of this free and authentic expression of a group of children who, through the exploration of creativity, drew the most diverse sewers out there, teaching about self-knowledge and the search for that authenticity and freedom that we often lose along the way. Who was it then?",
