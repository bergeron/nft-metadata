    "description": "“I like people who dream or talk to themselves interminably; I like them, for they are double. They are here and elsewhere.”   \n ― Albert Camus.\n\nWhen things are forbidden it takes dreamers to venture into the unknown and challenge perceived norms. Inspired by an Albert Camus quote, dreams and deliberate actions give rise to new forms, structures and possibilities where there was previously darkness. \n\nCreated by Brendan Dawes with Sion Trefor.\n\nMusic:  Bird in the House, composed and performed by Sion Trefor.",
