Moths have strong connections to the darker side of our world, also, symbolising change, death and rebirth. \n\nFacing the Fire.\n\nTraditional hand drawing with pen&ink taking over 100 hours in creation, any final purchase over 2 Eth will have the option of the original drawing framed in black & gold.",
