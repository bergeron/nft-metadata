    "description": "The name was inspired by a Twitter post from one of Maia's 'NFTKids' friends. \n\nThis monochrome water colour painting was a project Maia spent a month creating using a 'grid' technique to hand draw the horse, then use a wet sponge and wet brush technique for the shading.\n\nResolution is 2300px by 3200px at 280ppi\n\nMaia painted this at just 9 years old - turning 10 at the end of June 2022.\n",
