None of the sculptures were ever on location.\nThe images where created with social media in mind - to walk the thin line between trolling the viewer and engaging them in a playful way to question the nature of images perceived online.\n\n[thomasalbdorf.com/five-days](https://thomasalbdorf.com/five-days/)",
