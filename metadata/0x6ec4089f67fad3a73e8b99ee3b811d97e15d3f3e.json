    "description": "Series: Vision 89-8       \nTitle: Upturned \nGroup Title: Love Returned \nSize: 18” x 24”       \nMedium: Acrylic on Paper         \nFramed in Black 42” x 42”\nThe frame of this particular image contains a touch of white which is a fragment of the dove, the ancient symbol of peace, when viewed as a whole. \n\nSwinging to and from, we can imagine being upside down, playthings of green, gold, blue and red ready to entertain us. Forcing a new perspective is all part of the game, the heart of discovery. Tempting it may be to invert this experience for the “right” way, but best to leave it alone and instead allow yourself to understand. \n\n***\n\nWorld’s Largest Peace Painting brought to life! \n2,000 double-sided fine art paintings assemble into a 17-story monolith to inspire a Vision of Unity and Peace. \n\nThe NFT Vision of Unity and Peace Collection comprises one-of-one digital versions of each side of 2,000 paintings, totaling 4,000 NFTs in its entirety.\n\nVision of Unity is the front side comprising 2,000 pieces, representing all of us as a whole. Dual symbols of peace are formed, the white dove with its olive branch and the contemporary peace sign formed by 272 national flags. Within this framework we find 1,670 Visions: a community of global faces, revealing the entire spectrum of human emotion. The Mission paintings (14 pieces) convey ways we can collectively achieve the greater Vision. A solitary, surveying Eye and 3 colorful heart paintings beat at the core of the final image. \n\n***\n\nMost of us feel great concern about all the war, hate, and fear raging around us. Ehsan has created a brand to inspire global peace, giving half to charities. When you collect, you are part of the vision and investing in an asset class driven by a noble cause.\n\nEnvision a future where world peace is a reality.\n\nFor more info visit:\nhttps://www.visionsbyehsan.com\n\n\n"
