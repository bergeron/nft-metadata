    "description": "A Parisian heatwave, the scorching summer sun and air heavy with humidity.  \nYet the children defy this sweltering heat, their playful energy undeterred. They run through the mist with abandon, enjoying this liquid sunset to the fullest. In total osmosis with the scene, I breath in all this gold, wipe my sticky hands, point my camera and shoot. Donâ€™t wanna miss a single second of it.",
