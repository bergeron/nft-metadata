    "description": "We all try to hide our skeletons in the closet until they themselves fall out. We try to close this door as tightly as possible and not show it to anyone, we pretend that we are beautiful and we havenâ€™t sins. At first glance, we are always different, no one will ever show their true face. Even looking in the mirror, we don't want to see what is really there.",
