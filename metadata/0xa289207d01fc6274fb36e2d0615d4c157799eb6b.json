    "description": "In the depths of my mind, a battle rages on\nA war within myself, that cannot be won\nFor every step forward, I take two steps back\nSelf-sabotage my constant attack\n\nIn this endless struggle, I search for balance\nBut the scales always tip, with each and every challenge\nThe light and the dark, the good and the bad\nA never-ending dance, that leaves me feeling sad\n\nYet in the midst of this chaos, I find hope\nFor the ancient philosophy of yin yang helps me cope\nFor in the darkness, there is always a spark\nAnd in the lightness, there's a shadow in the park\n\nFor every failure, there's a lesson to learn\nAnd every mistake, a chance to discern\nThat in this war with myself, I am not alone\nFor yin and yang, together they have grown\n\nSo I embrace my flaws and accept my imperfections\nFor in this constant battle, there are no exceptions\nAnd through the darkness, a light will shine\nAs I find balance within and become truly divine.",
