    "description": "The picture tells the story of eternity and love, which\nis at odds with this eternity.\nShells, protecting their carriers, remain after their\ndeath as a reminder of the transience of life. At the\nsame time, shells, as an image of eternal existence,\nremind of themselves on everything that remains in\nthe water for a long time - they change the shape of\neverything that becomes theirs due to time. Stones\nin the water near the coast, forgotten ships or my\nlyrical heroes.\nAnd in this cold eternity, it gives us hope that it's all\nnot in vain, only love.",
