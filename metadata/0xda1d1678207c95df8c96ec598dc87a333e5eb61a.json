    "description": "I’ve noticed a very particular pattern that I go through right around the 18th of Feb every year.\n\nI start to get nervous. Maybe even sad.\n \nThen I subtly tell people it's my birthday. \nBut also that I'm busy with meetings, client work and other un-skippable things!\nI give people the out they need to entirely skip my birthday. \n\nAnd I want them to take that out so badly because,\n\nI HATE MY BIRTHDAY!\n\nI hate birthday cakes.\nI hate the small talk.\nI hate saying \"Thank-you\" & \"I love you\" to all the Instagram posts & stories.\nI hate standing awkwardly while people sing 'Happy Birthday' off-key. \n\nI know I sound ungrateful, & that friends & family are- in all fairness- just trying to show me some love. \n\nBut I'm tired & I'm older & this is my guilt free day.\n\nWhich is why, this birthday all I'm going to do is curl up on the couch with a Jägerbomb in my coffee cup, read my favorite book & ignore everyone's messages!\n\nOf course, I'll say sorry tomorrow.\n\nBut that's 28 year old me's problem!",
