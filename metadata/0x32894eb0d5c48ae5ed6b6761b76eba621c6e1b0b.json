    "description": "\"Perhaps every city changes faces at 2 a.m. on a Thursday night just as you realize it's too late to ring the watchman for a newborn and a smoke.\"  \n\n3456x3456 JPG \n\nTo create this project, I've used snippets of my poetry and prose from over the past 25 years as prompts and fed into a customized AI text to image workflow combined with various modifiers to obtain color and composition resulting in artworks which include cryptic yet beautiful ideas and emotions around the universal truth's of life, relationships, consciousness and existentialism.\n\nThis is an ongoing project and new pieces will be released periodically until 100 pieces have been minted.",
