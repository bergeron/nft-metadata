    "description": "Premium edition 1/1 of the long therm project \"Behind the Diaphragm\". Each woman is portrayed through an opaque cellophane. Model and photographer never meet. Each occupies their own half of the studio. The intimacy of the person portrayed is guaranteed, and she is always “protected” by the cellophane diaphragm. \n\n\"Behind the cellophane I felt first lost, then protected, and finally with a necessity to come out, with all the power in my body.\n \nThe sensation of suffocation and the knowledge that it was a play of forces between it and me was beautiful.\n \nI could rip him apart and he could suffocate me.\"",
