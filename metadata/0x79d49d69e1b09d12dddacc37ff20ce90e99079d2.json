    "name": "RED TEAR DROPS",
    "description": "21th of February, the anniversary of my father's death. \nI left home to go to my father's grave. A sudden fog appeared, the visibility dramatically reduced and traffic was about to stop. Due to the lack of driving safety, I decided to go back and take a tea break. At that time, I saw the woman in the red shawl with a coffee mug in her hand, she was feeding the birds. It was a movie like scene. I took out my camera and shoot using the flash. I named the photo \"Red Tear Drops\" in accordance with the meaning of the day.\n\nEdition - 1/1\n\nLocation - Kadikoy / Istanbul / Turkey \n\nDimension - 4608x3456\n\n",
