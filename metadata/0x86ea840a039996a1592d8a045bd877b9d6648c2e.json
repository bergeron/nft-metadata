    "description": "This is 1st NFT in a collection of 5 artworks that have been issued as a single, unique edition.\n\n⏱ Estimated work time: 12 hours\n\n✔️ Resolution: 3543x4724 px\n\nHere is the story.\n\nGabrielle was harassed by her photographer, whom she trusted greatly. \n\nShe always treated him with kindness and sincerity, and communicated how she cherished their friendship very honestly.\n\nOne day, her photographer made an advancement on her. After she expressed her shock to him, he appeared hurt, and said that he thought they had a special connection, which developed over the years, although he had a family of his own.\n\nAfter her final rejection, he has been spreading rumors about her, claiming that SHE has tried convincing HIM of their connection, and attempted to seduce him.\n\nWhen Gabrielle took the case to curt, he received overwhelming support, as the image a lowly photographer with a loving family was too strong against the image of a rich and successful single woman within the confines of the case.",
