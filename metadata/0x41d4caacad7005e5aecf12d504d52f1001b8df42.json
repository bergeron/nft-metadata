    "description": "One of five visual and auditory elements of Sensoria: Convergence. Scratch is the ache and relief of the piece. Without it, the music exists but with it, the music speaks. \n\nEach piece of the Sensoria collection acts as a form of pseudo-synesthesia. The human brain can be trained to think and process in new ways through great effort. This piece is a tool to begin developing the cross wiring of senses through association. \n\n---\n\nSensoria features an interactive element for collectors in that once multiple elements are collected by one person, the intersect of those two elements is minted as a new NFT to the collection. This effect stacks to three, four, and ultimately five interlocking elements, at which point the final piece, Sensoria: Convergence, is released. Each combination reveals in a new light, the association between visual and auditory elements and how certain aspects of a whole can speak together within it.",
