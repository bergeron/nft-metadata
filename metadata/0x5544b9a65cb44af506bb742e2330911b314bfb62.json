    "description": "Original Title:\nI hate parties ( 2017 )\n\nOriginal Description: \n“ the collection includes original designs inspired by personal emotions, pop art, romance comics and music. in no way shape or form are the designs meant to be offensive. your thoughts on a piece reflect the three asterisks that float behind them.\n\nlove, *** ”\n\n100% of the proceeds will go towards the weeb3dao scholarship under address: scholarship.weeb3dao.eth.\n\nthree asterisks started as designs I would dream of building as a brand. At the time I had no capital, was still in high school, and had no idea what I wanted to do in the future. The initial idea and push of wanting to become an entrepreneur through art prompt me to where I am today. The collection is a piece of my history that I want minted on the blockchain.\n\nAll original designs are done in Illustrator using the pen tool and a mouse. Bidders will be sent scans of the original sketches, respective of each piece they bid on within the collection.",
