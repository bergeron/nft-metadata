    "description": "Story behind the artwork:\n\n\"Absentminded Sheep\" is the return of the sheep from my artwork \"Unimpressed Sheep\". Three audacious could not resist to put themselves again in front of the forces of Mother Nature in scene. Completely unconcerned and absent minded they stand there, surrounded by the golden grain, until the storm departs again. \n\nThey will come again, for sure! \n\nArtist: Kathrin Federer\nCreated 2022 in Photoshop\n5023 x 4019 px | 300 dpi\nEdition 1/1\n\nValid Copyright and License:\nCC-ND-SA (others on request)\n\nThe first collector receives the original JPG and TIFF on request.",
