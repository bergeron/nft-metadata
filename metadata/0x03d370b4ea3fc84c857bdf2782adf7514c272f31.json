    "description": "CHURCH EGGs were created by a world famous artist who has chosen the anonymous alias \"Passionflute\" as a part of the ERC20 project $CHURCH. Announced on Easter Sunday, these crazy beautiful psychedelic spinning easter eggs are available for initial mint on https://church-dao.org/mint - these are utility tokens that can be blessesd, and will eventually hatch into something incredibly valuable. Stay tuned by following the $CHURCH team on twitter: https://twitter.com/ChurchDao777"
