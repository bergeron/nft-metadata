She was a mother who preserved the last flower and plant seeds from Vulvalini in a post-apocalyptical world.\n\nThis world looks a little different, driven by digitization and space-based energies. But the Keeper's goal remains the same: preserve and nurture seeds of nature's flora. \n\n1640 x 2360",
