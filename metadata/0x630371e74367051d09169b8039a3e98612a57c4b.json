    "description": "Mundari child warming up in the cattle camp at sunrise (South Sudan).\nThe Mundari are cattle herders who dedicate their lives to the care of their cattle.\nIn their cattle camps, kids are doing most of the daily work.\nThey collect the fresh cow dung and put it into piles which are then set on fire to repel the (extremely) numerous and voracious mosquitoes of the area.\nThe children with few guardinas are sleeping with the cows. \nThe ash from dung fires, as fine as talcum powder, is often used as bedding.",
