    "description": "Garnet Rousseau was born to a noble family in a small village in the middle of nowhere. When Garnet was five, her parents were killed by a band of robbers. Garnet was raised by her grandparents who were also sorcerers. From a young age, they saw great potential in her and began teaching her the ways of magic.  As she grew older, Garnet became more and more skilled in magic. Eventually, she surpassed her elders and became one of the most powerful sorcerers in the land. She gained notoriety for vanquishing evil wizards and beasts that terrorized the countryside.  One day, Garnet was summoned to the capital city to help defend it against a great dragon that had been terrorizing the kingdom. With her powerful magic, she was able to slay the dragon and save the city. She was hailed as a hero and ever since then has been respected and loved by all.",
