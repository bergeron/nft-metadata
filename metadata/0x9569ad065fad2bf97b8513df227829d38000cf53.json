    "description": "For months I was not ready to fully accept the loss of control I was feeling within my body. After starting this piece almost a year ago, I looked at it almost every day and wished I could finish it. I let frustration and anger consume me each time I picked up the paintbrush and couldn't keep my hand from shaking, so I stopped painting for months. This piece is a huge victory for me, as I had never finished a canvas until now. This was my first step toward accepting, adjusting, and loving myself in spite of the changes I am facing. ",
