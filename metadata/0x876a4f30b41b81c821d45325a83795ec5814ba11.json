    "description": "Artistic stories by A-Jay Goulding.\n\nA new beginning was upon them. The sun had just risen and the sky was blue, with wisps of white clouds drifting by on an unseasonably warm spring day. The air held a hint of moisture that would soon become thick humidity, but for now it was almost perfect. A few birds were chirping happily in the trees around them as they walked down the trail toward her destination. \n\nShe were about to enter the first true forest She'd seen in this land, and though there wasn't much of it, the trees here were tall and lush.\nThe sound of birdsong filled the air as she walked, her steps crunching along lush flowing grass. This part of the country looked like it got regular rain from time to time, which explained why the landscape was so green. In fact, despite how high up she were in the mountains, the grasses around them appeared almost tropical, with lush growths of ferns and other plants poking out",
