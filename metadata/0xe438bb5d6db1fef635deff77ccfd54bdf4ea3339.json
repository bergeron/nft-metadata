    "description": "The year is 5783, the presentation of being drawn into greater intimacy.\n\nDo you hear the call?  Do you connect the dots?  Do you sense the stars?  Do you feel the angels? \n\nBecome aware of the classified effortless actions– the invisible mystery of our world – \n\nCommunicate and identify what we are talking about – emerge from the mystery –\n\nWe are cultivating a practice and being in the form, simultaneously living in the mystery of our hearts. The mystery itself is the door for all being – let's enjoy the unknown, just be and stay open for surprises and the fruitfulness of the secret to unfold –\n\nSome of our desires are how we think the universe should be instead of observing the potential to emerge and meet in our hearts –\n\n-\tJai be the heart-to-heart - \n❤",
