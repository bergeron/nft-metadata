    "description": "Sugar baby takes us to another segment of our \"FEVER\" journey where I confide in a wealthy and privileged girl during emotional term-oil. This storyline is satire based on the \"Sugar Daddy\" Stereo types we are more commonly familiar with, instead this script is reversed. I explore what life would be like with this upper-hand and privilege to combat my emotional hardships and the everyday challenges, battles, and fears my self as well as many others have as a young man.",
