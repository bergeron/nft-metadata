    "description": "Initially done in watercolor, I limited the paints to the three primaries of red, blue, and yellow (Cadmium Red, Cobalt Blue, and Cadmium Yellow).  Each color blends into both of the other colors flanking it on either side, resulting in the secondaries of Violet / Purple (Red + Blue), Green (Blue + Yellow) and Orange (Yellow + Red).\n\nMovement was applied through MotionLeap app, spinning the color wheel counter-clockwise.\n\nThis 1/1 comes with the creator's commitment to provide a total of 90 minutes of art coaching / instruction per month (in perpetuity as long as @badelles.artstudio is alive). This is online and customized to the current collector's art learning needs. Sessions include creativity coaching, art exercises, pencil, watercolor, and digital drawing and painting. \n\nArt materials and apps are not included.",
