    "description": "Delusion is a belief that is not true, a false idea. \n\nIt’s not what you see, behind a beautiful body and beautiful life there is a reality. \nA glamorous lifestyle, beautiful body, perfect face and high-fashioned clothing it’s all delusional. \nEating pizza, chilling at home and being comfortable in your real skin, that's the reality and they should be normalized.\n\nNormalize skin texture. Normalize acne. Normalize white hair and skin patches. Normalize it all because all of it is normal. This is what reality looks like. Let’s get used to it. \n\nBetter a harsh reality than a comfortable delusion.\n\nLicense \n•  Artwork : CC BY-SA",
