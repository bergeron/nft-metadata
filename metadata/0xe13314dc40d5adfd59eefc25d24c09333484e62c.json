    "description": "Chapter VIII: in which Chewba the Cat meets the Christmas tree.\n\nHave you ever wondered how cats see our world? I tried to imagine a world hidden from our eyes, that only cats can see.\n\nMy fascination with my cat's attempts to play with toys on the Christmas tree led me to create this artwork. The melody was written using Machine Learning and inspired by Bobby Helms' song \"Jingle Bell Rock.\"",
