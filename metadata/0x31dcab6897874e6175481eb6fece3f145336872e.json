    "description": "Night. The World is in danger. Blondie. Quiet noise of a car crackling with fire. She lifted a dirty lighter from the ground and tried her best to light her cigarette. What are you doing?Â \n\nShe had never smoked before.\n\nThe sound of sirens came closer and closer with every attempt to light that poor cigarette. We create our reality with our thoughts? But does it really like that?\n\nShe had a ready-made plan for everything. She stood firmly and confidently on her black stilettos on that bumpy asphalt. Here they are. Just around the corner, approaching police car.\n\nWas this the end or a Happy New Beginning?",
