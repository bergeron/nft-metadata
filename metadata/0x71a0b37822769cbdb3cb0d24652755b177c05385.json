    "description": "The challenge for this piece was merging the lore and visual themes of the Polymorphic universe with those of Rengoku Legends â€”\n\nInitially I struggled to maintain the essence from either universe - early renderings of the creature didn't seem to thematically feel appropriate in either direction and it sat for a while in this ambiguous in-between state. Embracing the enigmatic motifs from both worlds and leaning into the psychedelic jelly-fish movement was what ultimately made this collaboration feel cohesive. \n\nAudio by @Drasko_V  ",
