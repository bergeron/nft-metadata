    "description": "Sanctioned at its core, is a 10 year long evolving artwork. A visual commentary on the ramifications of the most severe economic sanctions. The artwork will change yearly to reflect the crumbling, deterioration and vulnerability that citizens living under these sanctions have to deal with, Including difficulty receiving basic human needs, medicines and education. The underlying side effects of these sanctions reveal themselves over time as they irreversibly change societies for generations to come, As such, this artwork too will change with time and never fully return to its previous self. The gradual deterioration of the artwork speaks to the temporality of cities, the breakdown of architecture and the very fragility of human existence succumbing to the slow suffocation of economic sanctions.",
