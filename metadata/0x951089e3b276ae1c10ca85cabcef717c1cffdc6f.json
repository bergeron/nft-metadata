    "description": "The nuclear age started with the split of the atom, the threat of mutual destruction and the hope for the beginning an energy utopia on this planet. \n\nThe initial idea for this piece started of as an explosion of colour outwards and uses silhouette  to both create the idea of form and space in the composition but also acts as commentary on (in this case) the destructive force that the letters E = mc2 were yet to release on the world before 1945. They both show how life seems to move just as normal even when tragic events happen around the world , but also references the tragic lives lost in our journey to understand the atom (look up Hiroshima Shadows)\n\n- Moonsundiamond X Holly Herbert\n\n“The release of atomic power has changed everything except our way of thinking ... the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind. If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker. (1945)”\n- Albert Einstein ",
