    "description": "\"Uncharted Waters\" by Domenico Distilo is a limited series of ten visual artworks that explore the theme of transformation.\n\n Each portrait in the collection has been generated through a single seed and evokes the transformative experiences of imaginary creatures. \nAn ASCII coded word, randomly generated, adds an unexpected layer of meaning, creating a clash of semantics that reverberates through the piece. \n\nInspired by the theme of transformation, the collection features ten ASCII coded words including \"brotherhood\", \"path\", \"far\", \"brothers\", \"time\", \"concealed\", \"ascent\", \"imperfect\", \"gate\" and \"force\".",
