    "description": "From dances and songs, weary Adam.\nHe fell asleep, unwise, at the Tree of Knowledge.\nThe dazzling stars flutter above him,\nThe shadows of violet glide over the meadows,\nAnd his sleepy spirit flies over the meadows,\nand is suddenly overtaken by sinister dreams. He sees the flaming sword of angels,\nThat stings him and his friend mercilessly\nAnd drives him out of paradise into the harsh blizzard,\nWhere they have nothing to cover their hips and shoulders...\n–ù. Gumilev \n\nParadise is like a distant dream ... In this picture I convey the experience of man that there was a paradise on Earth ... or maybe that we create our own hell or paradise ...\n\n16000x7000 \noil on canvas \n\n\n",
