    "description": "This series came from a thought of my Dad.  \nSomeone who has kept his feelings all though the years just grinding it out day in and day out just to provide for the family. Some might call an emotional wreck but can also be masked as an Emotionless God. \n\nThis is a depiction of how I see ageing man of my Dads generation, the Emotionless Gods coming to emotional enlightenment. Hoping to then be able to live the life they always wanted. Some day.",
