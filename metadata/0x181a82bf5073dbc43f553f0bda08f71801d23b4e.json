    "description": "80s\n\nThe 80s were the age of illusion, hope, melodramatic love stories, a rise of pop, old school hip-hop (and of course!) A BIRTH OF CYBERPUNK TREND which in it's current visual appearance is based on digital  neon colors, modern virtual technologies and millennialsâ€™ aspirations to create an entirely new world.   \n\nThe 80s era was also marked with suppressing optimistic ideals of the 60s and transforming them into depressive, negative and aggressive culture of the 90s which resulted in economic crisis and strengthening of materialistic and consumeristic values.  \n\nIt was a transitional period that brought to fame many of today's contemporary thought leaders, experts, politicians and business tycoons. It is in fact an era that marked the beginning of the end! The period that formed an illusion which seemed to last forever but ended very fast!  \n\nThis current model represents a generous but wasteful use of planetary resources which has led to a world crisis we are experiencing today.
