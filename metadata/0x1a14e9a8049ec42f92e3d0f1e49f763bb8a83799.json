    "description": "A folkloric scene inhabited by biomorphic deities immersed in a boiling desert landscape, generates the ideal conditions for the proliferation of a new primordial soup; a myth of creation that is founded on the ruins and on the possibility of simulation.\n\nIn chaos, it seeks to extend beyond the limits of what's human, where there is no contention of  categories but only potential. In the unrevealed, its only chance to spawn something new. In the void that exists between one state and another, in the transitions, there is an intensity: when consciousness is turned off, there is fear for its whereabouts. And in the unknown, space is opened for the ritual, which celebrates the link between the finite and the infinite.\n\n\"El desmayo\" is a collaboration by Daira and The Internet Office, presented as an installation in the first physical exhibition by CryptoArg that was held on Dec, 2021, in Buenos Aires. The digital image worked as a backdrop for a landscape inhabited by sculptures.\n",
