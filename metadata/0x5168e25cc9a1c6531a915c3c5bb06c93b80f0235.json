    "description": "THE WORD ON THE STREET\n\nMet Fabiola and Tex at the local record shop discussing AI and this is how it went:\n\nFabiola: Okay, maybe I got a little carried away there. I mean, it's not like the machines are going to completely take over the music industry... yet. But seriously, AI-generated music is the next big thing. Just think... We can create completely unique and ground-breaking music, that pushes the boundaries of what we think is possible. And hey, if a few machines end up topping the charts along the way, who's to say that's a bad thing?\n\nTex: I don't care how sophisticated these AI programs get, they'll never be able to replicate the soulful riff of a good old-fashioned guitar solo.\n\nAi Machina: Look, I get it, AI-generated music and art can be impressive. But if we let the machines take over completely, what's next? Robot presidents? I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords.\n\nSynthetic Photo \nPNG / 2048 x 2048 \n\nPersonal use granted.  \nCopyright Â© 2023 All rights reserved.",
