    "name": "Occultation",
    "description": "An occultation is an event that occurs when one object is hidden by another object that passes between it and the observer. The term is often used in astronomy, but can also refer to any situation in which an object in the foreground blocks from view (occults) an object in the background.\n\nThis piece is about flowing with the cycles of our consciousness; learning to explore and accept our own darkness in all of its phases. An acceptance to see beyond the thin veil presented to the observer.\n\n1/1\nMP4\n4000x4000px\n00:26\n30FPS",
