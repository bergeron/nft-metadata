    "description": "They say the eyes are the windows to the soul but what is the soul? What does it look like? \n\nThe Ghost in the Machine, part one of The Ghost Series, is a depiction of a ghost trying to wear a human face? \n\nThis spirit within that always asks the deeper questions of self. What am I? Am I more than this body? Am I real?",
