    "description": "Softgirl describes a youth subculture that emerged among teenagers around mid-to late-2019 based on a deliberately cutesy, feminine look. It draws a lot of parallels with some of the Kawaii-centric aesthetics in Japan, but with a more subdued look compared to how over-the-top some of the looks in Japan tend to get. It's popular among some young women on social media. It, alongside the E-Girl and VSCO Girl, has become incredibly popular on TikTok. Being a soft girl also may involve a tender, sweet personality.\n",
