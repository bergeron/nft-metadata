    "description": "Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from flow measurement and is used to solve practical problems. It's beautiful and inherently complex fractal nature has had an immeasurable impact on engineering and technological advancement. Only now can supercomputers attempt to simulate the physics involved in real world fluid flow.",
