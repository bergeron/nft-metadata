    "description": "Through the fusion of milk and body, shape and container, pixel and shader, LIQUID HARMONY by OONA establishes a bond between the artist and their creative output. \n\nBeginning in its raw and unadulterated form, the video art series gradually evolves, piece by piece, inviting viewers to untangle the complexities of its imagery using their prior knowledge as a guide.\n\nMeticulously applying low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) to trigger Interactive Shader Formats (ISF), the videos harmoniously blend the milk and its maker, unifying the visual experience. The accompanying soundscape resonates with the noise of milk pouring and tones of DMinor. \n\nThis series encompasses two distinct perspectives that add depth to its narrative: a direct gaze at the milk presents a visual register of equality, while a top-down view of OONA situates the audience in a position of power and authority. LIQIUD HARMONY invites viewers on a journey into namelessness, where milk overflows, dissolving boundaries of the female body and illuminating the dynamics of power.\n\nLIQUID HARMONY is part of the exhibition A BEATING HEART. FEMALE PIONEERS OF DIGITAL ART presented by EXPANDED.ART on view 17 May - 4 June 2023 in Berlin.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/6b07fb60-7c67-46df-a8fa-888dae71daef",
