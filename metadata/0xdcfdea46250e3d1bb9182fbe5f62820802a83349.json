    "description": "yo! we're back for our 2nd solo drop on sound! this one is called 'impulsive' and we couldn't be more excited to share it with everyone.\n\nfun fact: the initial idea for the song was created on march 6th of last year (2022). so, it took a little over a year for us to finish this one.\n\nimpulsive was one of those songs that took on many different forms over it's creation period. it took on a total of 6 different versions until we settled on the one we liked most. it initially started out as the first verse & hook that you hear with the guitar. then we spent the next 12 months sitting on the record & playing around with production elements until we landed on the writing & production we liked. for this particular project, the writing really helped inform the rest of the song while we were making it. \n\nimpulsive is definitely one of the more personal songs we've put out. it's about being in a relationship with a person who can't seem to control themselves & always seems to make irrational, impulsive decisions. at the time this was something we were dealing with in our own lives & writing this was our way of coping with the situation. \n\nanyway, we hope you like it. much love.\n\n- alex & dan",
