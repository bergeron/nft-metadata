    "name": "There Is Someone Inside",
    "description": "There is someone inside not knowing what happens to the outside world. He’s been busy with his own and not paying attention about the flight of the pigeons out there. But for me that’s the best part. How he stays calm inside, but at the same time those birds were panic outside. Like Scarecrow said in Dark Knight, “there's nothing to fear but fear itself!.”",
