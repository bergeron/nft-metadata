    "description": "The idea for this painting came to me in a dream.\nMetamorphoses are changes in consciousness that occur under the influence of environmental factors on the feelings of the individual. The result of these changes is the emergence of new values, beliefs or changes in old ones.\nOver time, a person can look at the same things in different ways. But in this picture you can find another meaning, because each of us creates our own reality.",
