    "description": "The Big Snow Walk lasted about three hours. I didn't feel the cold — just stopped sometimes to smoke and warm up my fingers, which were no longer able to properly release the shutter.\n\nBy 7 p.m. the frost started to get hard, but I couldn't stop — the built-in flash was creating magical patterns of snowflakes. Each time was different.\n\nWhen the ice started to appear on lens, I decided to take the last two shots and finally go home. The first one was bad, the second one in front of you.\n\nHave you noticed that because of the snow — the cold snow! — everything around you is starting to look very warm?",
