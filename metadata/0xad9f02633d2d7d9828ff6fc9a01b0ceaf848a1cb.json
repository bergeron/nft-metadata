    "description": "During my visit to Uganda's famous Coffee region in Mt Elgon, I documented the different processes that Coffee undergoes before it ends up as a hot brown beverage.\n\nWhen I look at this image my heart opens up. I see one of life's most special bonds, one between a child and its mother. Appreciate the love & care you received from your parents because no one will ever support and believe in you as they do.\n\nThis Image is to pay tribute to the farmer's hard labour, their dependence on sustainable coffee and the resilience they've shown towards the Pandemic.\n\n*The first Collector will receive 250g of speciality Coffee Beans, sourced from these farms.\n\n20% of the Proceeds will go to this specific Village.\n\n*optional",
