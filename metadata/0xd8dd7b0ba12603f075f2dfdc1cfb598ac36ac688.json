    "description": "This is the first photo I made from this series which I started in 2016, which launched this ongoing exploration of how we experience time.\n\nMy first experience of modern ballet literally left me breathless and I wanted to find a way to capture more than the typical dance \"poses.\" I wanted to capture a chunk of time in a single frame. What moved me most was the movement, the energy, the abstract forms the dancers created.\n\nVolume.I-Variation.I encapsulates the core of this series. It's about being in the present, poised and balanced, looking forward into the future, but showing the history of where we were and how we got here. Nothing really travels in straight lines, but rather in waves, oscillations and curves. \n\nThis is my genesis NFT. Originallly minted April 3rd, 2021. I bought it back from the original collector, burned it and re-minted it as part of a collection, because Foundation did not have an option for it back then.\n\n\n3824x2552\n1 of 1\n",
