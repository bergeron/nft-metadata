    "description": "“Landscape” is a soundtrack to anyone getting their yard cleaned and landscaped. \n\n     Land, like water, is always in motion. Our daily interactions with different landscapes are vast. \n\n     This track is inspired by the movement of land and how a beautiful landscape can move you to be creative. The landscape of music and art is in a beautiful space right now. New ideas and brand-new landscapes to explore! \n\nMake sure you cut that grass though! \nRespectfully.\n\nArtwork by MEGA",
