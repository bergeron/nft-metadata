    "description": "Acodonqua is a conceptual depiction of a beautiful black damsel...It's minimal, yet very detailed and colorful. She's adorned with a bright red robe along with colorful braids and shiny jewelry. The piece has a graffiti look but at the same time feels a classic, dry brush canvas painting.\nThe painting was done in two versions; Acodonqua-Silver and Acodonqua-Gold. This is the golden version; a very colorful and elegant depiction of a black queen with a golden theme. It's intricately designed to capture the beauty and complexity of femininity. There's deep meaning added to the piece with the 'adinkra symbols' embedded in the piece; they are like the zodiac signs of africa with each symbol expressing a meaning about life.",
