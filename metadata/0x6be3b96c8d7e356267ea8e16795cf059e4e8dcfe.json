    "description": "Humans became extinct and I was the last person left on the planet! I lived alone and hopeless for a while. Until, from the galaxy, a light came upon me, and along with it, a fragrant, bright pink apple was placed in my hand. I held it up to my face and inhaled deeply. \nSuddenly, the globe separated from under my feet, shrank, and settled in the place of my heart. I looked under my feet. \nIt was written: Welcome to your new planet!",
