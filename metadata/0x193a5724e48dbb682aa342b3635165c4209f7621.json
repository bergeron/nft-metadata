    "description": "Ever since I was a child, deep blue waters have always fascinated me. The fact that there is a world beneath our feet that has not yet been fully discovered makes my mind swim with wonder. A few days before leaving Mexico, I checked a deep blue dream off my bucket list. I was able to dive in one of the most dramatic cenotes I have ever experienced. With a depth of over 70 meters and a very narrow lid opening at the top, these conditions create beams of light that would refract like a laser into the deep blue, crossing a sulfide cloud at a depth of 28 meters. This sulfide cloud is so dense that I could not swim in it for too long. Once I descended into the cenote to discover its mysteries, I completely lost sense of time, distance, and the reality from above. \n\n\"Ascending\" conveys that feeling I had when I was lost in those deep blue depths.",
