    "description": "2304 x 2238 px  |  .mp4\n\nOriginally made on Polaroïd film with chemicals, isopropanol, fluorescent ink, holographic foil, heat/cold & pressure at measured times. The green/blue part was shot under a blue UltraViolet light.\n\nThis series is about unexisting places, shaped by our own interpretations. A cartography of emotions which only exist in our deep thoughts.\nUsing the pareidolia psychological phenomenon, we try to perceive familiar shapes and patterns.\nA short moment where past, present and future are reunited together to create new meanings.",
