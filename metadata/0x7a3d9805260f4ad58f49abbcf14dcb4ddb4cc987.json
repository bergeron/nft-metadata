    "description": "Glitch Goddess with AI Glitched Runway \n2022 \nMedia: Mp4 1080 X 1920  \nLooping Video 21 seconds \nUnique 1/1 \n4 Ethereum Reserve  \n\nAnimation and Sound Design by Marjan Moghaddam  \n\nDerived from the critically acclaimed #GlitchGoddess fine arts collection of digital projects, this genesis gold and black figure is set against an AI GAN-generated future city with an infinite loop, glitched GAN runway. Glitch Goddess defies art historic conventions of depicting the female figure in a singular form, by switching from slender to heavy, pregnant, glitched, stylized, and abstract within the same mesh, chronometrically. Using Marjanâ€™s original and unique style of figuration in 3dCG, these Post Humanist figures are in a state of constant flux, resisting singular sculptural forms while expanding the possibilities of the figure through digital and virtual plasticity. As artistic interventions and Avant Garde 3dCG, they present a contemporary aesthetic for refiguration in the post millennial era.  ",
