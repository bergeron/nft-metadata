This photo is the result of what happens when the wind unexpectedly changes, and you end up drifting through the No Fly Zone above the Australian Parliament House. This area is restricted for all types of aircraft including drones, so I made the most of the circumstances and captured this image from an angle that is rarely seen.\n\nHigh resolution version available to asset owner",
