    "description": "Inspired by heliotropic plants. The leaves on these plants move throughout the day by following the direction of the sun. \n\nWhat I find so interesting about this, is much like the plants, we have our own circadian rhythm, also directed by night and day. Learning more about how plants can communicate with each other more than we ever thought previously. Made me wanted to create a project all about plants to capture their beauty, and curiosity.\n\nThe sounds you hear are bioacoustics which investigates the actual sounds emitted by plants. ",
