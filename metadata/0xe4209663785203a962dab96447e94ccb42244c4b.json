    "description": "This collection, made in collaboration with AI, explores the fluidity and hybridity of the human body. The cyborg serves as a metaphor for a body that transcends traditional categories and boundaries. By blurring the lines between humans, animals, and machines, we invite viewers to contemplate our complex relationship with technology and consider how it shapes our identity and understanding of self.\n\nInspired by Donna Haraway's essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto.\"  \nMANIFESTO CYBORG - LIMITED AIRDROP EDITION  \nMade with Midjourney - 2023",
