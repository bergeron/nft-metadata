    "description": "\"Tiger come to say goodbye in the year of tiger\" was first sold at \"To The Moon\" Auction by Bangkok Art Auction Center on 19 March 2022 for 85,000 Thai Baht (approximately 2,512 USD)\n\nWhile various types of these big cats are on the verge of extinction, \"Fleeing Tiger\" tattoo is still a popular charm to protect against dangerous creatures, and to create confidence and power.\n\n This work shows a tiger surrounded by what are considered to be taboo to the \"Fleeing Tiger\". Soon, the Tattoo will no longer protect anyone as these tigers disappear from the world, living only in the imaginary one.",
