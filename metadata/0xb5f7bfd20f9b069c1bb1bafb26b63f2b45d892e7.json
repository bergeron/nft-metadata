    "description": "Do I belong here?\n\nThis energy is anxious, not bright. \nWith no end in sight, just fight or flight. \nThese kids aren’t alright. \n\nThis air isn’t light. I’m suffocating, chest tight.  \nNeither smog nor smoke… no, it’s generation “grind”.  \nPrecluding creative bliss whilst numbing the mind. \n\nI don’t want to march amongst drones. \nFriends, rather than “seeing” each other, hide behind phones. \nPhysically together, increasingly alone. \n\nIsolating while feigning connection.\n\nWith such velocity, moments are blurred. \nAmongst such chaos, waves won’t be heard.  \nSouls that are perpetually drifting, left unsecured.\n\nHumanity is no longer human.\n\nI need solitude. A space to pause time, allowing  \nMy spine to align,  \nMy heart to restart,  \nAnd my brain to regain the vibrant energy that’s drained from my veins…\n\nNo, I don’t belong here. \n\nArtist: Alex Mackenzie",
