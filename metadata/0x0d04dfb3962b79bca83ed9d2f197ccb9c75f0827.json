    "description": "\"A Sunset Through His Eyes\" is a tribute to my Grandfather\n\nMy Grandfather, Rafael Gutierrez Villase√±or, was a recognized painter in San Blas Nayarit Mexico,  where he took experiences and the surroundings of the little fisherman town he grew up in, to paint his amazing environments.\n\nI made a homage and re-create those paintings grabbing as much detail from the original pieces as possible to transport the viewer into the feeling that the painting represents. \n\nThis is the first piece of this collection. It will not conclude until most of the real paintings are done.\n\n\nHopefully, this collection will transport the collector into a realm of nature, peace, and love such as it did to my family and myself.\n\nSee the original painting here:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/ChloHLQucaY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\n\n3440x1440 px",
