    "description": "In the East, because of the New Year's communication, fireworks have become more common in winter. The smoke will be scattered in the cold wind, and the fireworks will burst into countless smaller particles from an object by burning, which is both matter and energy (this is the magic of  fire )\nAnd in this change, countless flames drifted into the air, I call it fire of wind",
