    "description": "The art depicts a grand hourglass. On the top half, the hourglass is filled with beautiful nature, beauty and wonder of nature. But it slowly dripping down to the bottom half, as if time is slipping away.\nThe bottom half of the hourglass is filled with the cities. And it shows the impact of human progress on the natural world.\nThe art is a reminder of the delicate balance between nature and civilization, and the importance of preserving the beauty of the natural world for future generations.",
