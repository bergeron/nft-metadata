    "description": "The tiny star orbiting the Earth, the moon is visible to humans almost every night. The dark side of the moon, however, is only seen during the solar eclipse.\n\nHer only wishes are to see the Earth, to get freedom and for there to be a replacement.\n\nHer attachments and kindness led her to her failure. The hard to get opportunity is gone, but she have not given up. She will try again in the next eclipse.\n\n3100 x 4000 px\n300 dpi",
