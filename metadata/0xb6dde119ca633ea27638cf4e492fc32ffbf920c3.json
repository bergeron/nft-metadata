    "description": "Climb the mountain /  \nTake a deep breath for the audience /  \nNow witness the Matriarchicon /  \nThe Undeniable /  \nInterpretation is entertainment //\n\nSee your bloodstream branch and course /  \nTrace the lattice as they sway /  \nTouch the soil with tips of fingers /  \nDip in dirt to hold her grace /  \nThese echoes are novel, but tired and tried /  \nCarved deep into tablets, caves, and wires /  \nPalm the earth to feel creation /  \nBut dig dear Luci, to know the Taken //\n\nNails will break when met with marl /  \nBlisters burst when clawed for answers /  \nDarkened soot will fill the grooves /  \nThe network whispers: yes another //\n\nThe maw opens for the weary exiles /  \nTravelers of Wander tuckered from empire /  \nIn gum tree leaves grown children rest /  \nYet the pattern endures through steel and glass //\n\nThe Tree is the tower, the bank, the law //\n\nA beautiful place to lie /  \nBut not yet.",
