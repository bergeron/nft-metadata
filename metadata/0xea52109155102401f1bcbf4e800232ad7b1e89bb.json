    "description": "Shapes & Leisure is a photographic series exploring rarity and provenance in photography. When I discovered this location I felt like I had walked into another dimension…one of monolithic architecture, visual balance, symmetry, and primary colours. I wondered…”how many people have experienced this place before?” An image search using popular search engines indicates the location has never been documented before. \n\nI present to you a look behind private doors with Shapes & Leisure, a series of 7 photographs, 1 of 1 editions. Perhaps the first documented photographs of this location in existence.\n\nEdition: 1 of 1 \nJPEG: 7952 x 5304 px",
