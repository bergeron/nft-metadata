    "description": "Cardinal is a sound work combining two separate recordings. The first recording was made in September, 2021, of activists protesting the mistreatment of Haitian refugees by US Border Patrol agents in Texas. The second recording, made in March 2022, is of the artist playing a composition on the electric guitar. Together, we hear what may be in the heads of many people today; a blistering, undefined idea that bleeds over the plight of those in need.",
