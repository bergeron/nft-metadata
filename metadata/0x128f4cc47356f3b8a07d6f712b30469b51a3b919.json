    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a place where living beings existed. \n\nAll beings in that place looked different in color. They had different personalities and motives, although they started existing in the same place, in the same way.\n\nYet they managed to embrace one another as they were. No discrimination or marginalization happened there.\n\nAnd they danced happily ever after.\n\n",
