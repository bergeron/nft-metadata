I hated you for this, I loved you for this, I forgave you for this and thanks to you today I know how to love.\n\nToday that I am about to leave the reach of your arms, that life calls me and sits you in bed, today I understand and my heart burns for your love, I want to protect you as when you protected me being in your arms.\n\nToday I can't tell you how much I love you, not because I don't want to, but because my heart stops when the words come out. That is why I dedicate my most precious work to you, My Mother, My true love.\n",
