This 7-of-7 performance is with the aspiring Gundam pilot, anime rapper & NFT innovator, Black Dave.\n\nThese are the first live music performances minted on the blockchain & this is the last wavROOM from Season 1. \n\nHistory is being made today! This wavROOM feat. BlackDave will be a first for the largest on-chain splits via Reveel — 154 unique wallets. Black Dave included anyone who owns his utility NFT, the Gundam key, and his “What the Fuck” Sound.xyz NFT in the splits.\n\nwavWRLD partnered with Glass.xyz & Reveel to record & mint the performances.\n\nVideo, Editing & Color by LadiDadi @ladidadilive\nAudio, Mix & Master by Invictus @theoginvictus",
