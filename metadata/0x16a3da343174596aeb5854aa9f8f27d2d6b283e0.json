    "description": "Sometimes we have to break down to BREAKTHROUGH...\n\nAnd that’s what the BREAKTHROUGH collection is all about. We’ve all been in that cruel tug of war between our paralyzing fear of change, and our guilt of staying the same…\n\nBut with this project I want to remind you that change has its own timeline, and that you should keep believing in your own breakthrough…  \n\nThis collection is made up of my first two songs, and I want you to have a piece of them… of me. First up was 'BROKEN,' and now comes ‘FOOL’…\n\nI wrote this song about my first heartbreak, but I know we’ve all felt the pain of being replaced and questioning where things went wrong. So this one is for all of us!\n",
