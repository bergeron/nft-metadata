    "description": "Rosetuffs are a race of alien pets with soft, fluffy pink fur that resembles rose petals. They have large, expressive eyes and a friendly disposition, making them popular as companions among the Xenovians. Their long, curved tails are covered in the same fluffy fur as the rest of their body, and they use them to communicate with each other through a complex system of movements and gestures. They are known for their ability to emit a calming aura that can soothe even the most restless of minds. They are often used by the Xenovians in meditation and relaxation practices. In addition, their fur contains a natural healing agent that can be used to treat minor wounds and injuries. "
