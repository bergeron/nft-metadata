    "description": "Indifference here throws light on what most have maybe joked about and some pay zero attention to. No matter how we put it , we're all humans and that makes us one despite the color of our skin.\n\nThis artwork lays emphasis on the hand of one with 'vitiligo' , something some see as a weird sickness whereas people like me and @ agbatamessoma sees it as unique.\n\nAs an artists who most of the time creates from emotions and deep connections I find this what creating. I hope you enjoy it!\n\n___________________\npencils on paper.\n30 x 33 cm , | 2023 |",
