    "description": "This is the first installment of crypto monks. Value #0001. (the very og)\n\nEach monk is hand made. I click the color of every single pixel. No randomization besides what my brain decides is good. Different background colors equate to different tiers. I am going to create one to two thousand of these over time. Depends on the demands of the people, as I will collectively take everyone's perspective and process a decision. I really hope you enjoy this collection, and would love if you joined the discord and made any suggestions. I am always open to feedback.\n\nJoin our discord or check us out on twitter.\n\nthank you for your time.",
