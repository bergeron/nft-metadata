    "description": "Checks-style art created by YoshiWins, using WVRPS #9579\n\nFirst snapshot taken shortly after mint ends. Mint because you like the art, and everything else is gravy. Fair warning: Yoshi likes gravy, so there will be gravy, especially if you're a fellow WVRPS holder. But, even non-WVRPS holders will get a little gravy. Be careful cooking the gravy... you might burn it.\n\nNot a WVRPS holder? No idea what WVRPS are? Wake up to the pioneer music NFT powered by generative AI artists who were around before AI was cool.\n\nOriginal WVRPS NFT: https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xcbc67ea382f8a006d46eeeb7255876beb7d7f14d/9579\n\nWarpsound AI, the creators of WVRPS:  \nhttps://www.warpsound.ai/",
