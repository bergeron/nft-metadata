    "description": "These planes are from flight school, pilots start flying mosquitos and end up flying eagles.\n\nAll my aerials are taken from a helicopter. \n\nMost people experience planes through busy airports, small windows, etc. \nI want to show how nice they are from above and how they look majestic and graphical. Combining the right timing and right framing was the difficulty there was no place for approximation. I had to ask for lots of permission to be allowed to fly above operative airports.",
