Stories we must tell, question and protest against, until they become nothing more than an old, forgotten tale of our society.\n\n*  \nSome of the people on the funeral wondered why she didn't cry. Those with a more accurate sense of humanity needed no explanation and silently whispered a prayer of gratitude for not being on her shoes even though the ghost of the old, undying hatred still hovered over their heads.\n\nAs she said farewell to the 3rd son in the span of 28 months, all she had inside was deep, dark and dense ocean of nothing.\n\nWhen the reporter approached to ask if she'd like to say a few words or address the alarming rise on the number of police brutality cases against the young black community on the city, she lifted her dry, tired and hopeless eyes, hooking them on the reporter's anxious gaze.\n\n\"Just stop killing my boys\"\n\n*\n\nAI Generator: Midjourney.  \nLocation: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  \nEdition: 1/1  \nYear: 2023  \nPhotographer: Victor Ribeiro \nDimensions (in pixels): 1024 × 1535",
