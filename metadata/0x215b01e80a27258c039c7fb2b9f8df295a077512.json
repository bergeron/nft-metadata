    "description": "The Queen of the Dorkside is a mischievous response to the hand-wringing around artists working with new technologies. This cartoonishly malevolent character forever laughs her sinister laugh, echoing through an infinite field of dark, yet vibrant, video feedback.\n\nThe piece takes inspiration from various realms of media culture: melodrama, public access television, and a 2005 episode of “Trading Spouses” are all in the mix. As an inverse of the artist’s character “The Light Witch,” it demonstrates the psychedelic viewpoint that perception of anyone can shift depending on the light under which they are viewed.\n\nSignature Video Alchemy artwork by Sarah Zucker / @thesarahshow. Performed and crafted in studio with original footage, video feedback and analog processing on VHS. Digitally transferred in 1080p and upscaled to 4k. Costume fabricated by Jocelyn Knobs.\n\nvidalc token #1. Single Edition, 2022.",
