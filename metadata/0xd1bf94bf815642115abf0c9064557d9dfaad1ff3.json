    "description": "A collection of 6000 MetaGreta's that feature a alternative and unique pool of beautiful traits. We have collaborated with different really good digital artists to make beautiful NFT’s based on a caricature of Greta Thunberg. With different beautiful enviromental backgrounds and suiting accessories. The full collection are 6000 Metagreta’s. We like the idea of 6000 unique MetaGreta’s in the metaverse protecting the earth, encouraging and being a character with different traits. Each NFT have different traits and rarities that will show up as stats in the different marketplaces they are listed on. Some traits are common and some are rare! Every NFT is Unique and tells you more about the owner than other NFT’s. Owners who take som responsibility for the enviroment and wants to give back.",
