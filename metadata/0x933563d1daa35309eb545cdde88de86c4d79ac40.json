    "description": "I am a stranger in this world. All I need is meaning. But where can I find him? Such emptiness inside. Despair. Gray, deaf, hopeless, deep despair.\n\nI'm ready to give EVERYTHING for a tiny grain of insight. Only everything is the same around. Nothing makes sense. I want to go to sleep and never wake up again. I'm so tired. Tired of thinking. I'm tired of looking. Tired of living. I'm on edge. I'm desperate",
