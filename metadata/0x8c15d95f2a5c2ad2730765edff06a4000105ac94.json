    "description": "Hunters of the world flock to the Springs of Sapphos to find rest and rejuvenation after many months of constant work. Located in the distant countryside of Germany far from any danger, the Springs of Sapphos continue millennia of luxury and aquatic healing tradition.\n\nThe demoness Yumi prefers a private bath, spending a large sum from her biggest hunt to afford a quiet bath far from prying eyes. Despite her acclimation to the cold, she can't help but have a fondness for the scalding stone bath.",
