Pump it is a brutally honest project where we hold everyhing to zero and vibe. Absolutely nothing will happen when minting this. Absolutely nothing will happen if you sell. Absolutely nothing will happen if you hold. Just have fun. If you sell you are a bigot. If you hold, you are a bigot. If you put in hidden, you are a bigot. We are all making stupid degen plays, so why not have fun while doing it.",
