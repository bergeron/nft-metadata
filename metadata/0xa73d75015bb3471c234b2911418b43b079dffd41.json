    "description": "Item #1 from the \"The Legacy of Lake Urmia\" collection is available as editions! This collection includes my most valuable shots taken in Lake Urmia, where I think we need to pay attention to its legacy that is remained for us! All my photos in this collection are kind of impossible to retaken, cause the lake is going to drought out and the subjects in my photos are going to extinct! So I captured valuable moments of this lake for you! Enjoy them!\n\nAbout item #1: \"Rise of Hamzeh Ship\" is one of my precious photos from the lake taken on June 24, 2022. The ship which is named \"Hamzeh\" is completely broken right now and there is no water there to capture this scene again! A brilliant moment in the history of Lake Urmia! This photo was once published on NASA's Instagram page as a story! So I do love to see it spreading everywhere and reaching more eyes, that's why I chose the minimum price of 0.005 ETH and the Open Edition method for it to be more affordable for you! LFG!",
