    "description": "Objective + Inception =  Obception\n\nCode-generated fractal renderings that are tailored to appear like actual or abstract objects using a hybrid of custom code and visual graphic tools.\n\nOriginally launched via a centralized-marketplace's smart contract in 2021, I decided to relaunch the project using my own smart contract. The first 8 pieces minted are from the original project and will have OG properties that may allow certain privileges such as VIP access to my other projects, present and future.\n\nDreaming Tree is the first piece of the 8 OG Obceptions.",
