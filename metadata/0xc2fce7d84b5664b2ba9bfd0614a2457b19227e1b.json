    "description": "Good Griefs is a collection of the 250 best Blockhead tweets from over four years. Sparked by a Lord of the Flies childhood, life as a professional gambler, and stints at a crypto startup and screenwriting, each of these pieces is inspired, or completely pulled, from real life. Sometimes a scratchpad, sometimes a urinal, this Twitter feed has been one of the few things to endure over this time period. Each selection is intended to communicate a feeling to the reader. When going to an emotional extreme, often a painful process, you do not forget how you got there. And when it is someone else who takes you there, you remember you are not alone. Once minted, the tweet is permanently deleted.",
