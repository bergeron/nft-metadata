    "description": "The magnificent show that is a corona during a northern lights display will stop you in your tracks. This awe-inspiring moment was over the Calgary, Alberta area on March 24, 2023 at around midnight MST.\nI had 4 Ukrainian refugees with me viewing this first show and it was a magical moment. You will receive this unwatermarked HD file during a truly colorful part of this display.\n\nI am one of Alberta's original aurora chasers and my astrophotography has been used to advance space physics research. View chasingsteve.com to understand Alberta's unique role in the night sky.\nhttps://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/466/christy-turner/",
