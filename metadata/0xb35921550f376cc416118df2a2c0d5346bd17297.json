    "description": "To honor all of the women in the world, I have created the Warrior Ladies collection that is composed of several pieces of art with the objective to acknowledge all of the beautiful women in the world, starting with my wife. With this collection of art I recognize women from all of the races, of all of the colors, and from all of the socio-economic positions from the poorest to the richest.  \n  \nThe original characters of this Collection are called Warrior Ladies because they fight a figurative cyber war against darkness in the highest of heavens in favor of the light within a modern digitally futuristic setting alluding to the Web3, Crypto and Dapps.  Lucy is one of the Warrior Ladies that finds herself in a space station full of cyber/digital lighting.\n\nI appreciate your support to my creations and to the theme that I am eagerly pursuing!!  Thanking you  \nall for your attention and kindness!!",
