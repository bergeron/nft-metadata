    "description": "The Circle is the Jagwar Twin \"Genesis\" story and in many ways I think it tells the human story. Released on the album \"33\", it is a song that carries infinite variation and will continue to grow and evolve with time.\n\nThe Circle (O) is the latest version of that story, told with layers of analog synthesizers, an electronic heartbeat, and a new vocal performance that transports the listener to a place outside of Space and Time. The release of this song coincides with an update to the Hall of Mirrors metaverse where the album version of The Circle can be collected in the new listening room for Crown holders.",

      "text": "Long ago, there was a Jagwar with a world tied on a String\nAnd She made other Jagwars, then taught them to sing\nShe would come down to The Empires of the Earth, Wind, and the Sea\nAnd She'd walk with the Jagwars, this song they would sing\n\n\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nFrom the inside of the Inside\nThe Circle will grow\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where you go\n\n\nAUM\n\n\nMany cycles of The Story came and went with their Kings\nAnd the New Kings told Jagwars they never could sing\nSo the Maker of the Jagwars hid the Song inside their Wings\nOn the inside of the Inside, then left them to sing\n\n\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nFrom the inside of the Inside\nThe Circle will grow\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where you go\n\n\nWell the Earth changed and the Sky raged for the Jagwars on The String\nAnd The Empires built cages and sold everything\nTill a Wise One found a small Cave where the Jagwars used to sing\nAnd the Wise One remembered She once held The String \n\n\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nFrom the inside of the Inside\nThe Circle will grow\nOn\nThe Circle will grow\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where you go\n\n\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nFrom the inside of the Inside\nThe Circle will grow\nOh\nThe Circle will grow\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where You go\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where You go\nBut the inside of the Inside must be where You...\nGo\n",
