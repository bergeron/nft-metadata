    "description": "The Trabzon Hagia Sophia (Ayasofya) Church, which is a museum today, was built by Manuel I Komnenos(1238-1263), one of the kings of the Empire of Trabzon (Trebizond).\n\nAfter the conquest of Trabzon in 1461 by Sultan Mehmed II (the Conqueror), the building was converted into a mosque and became a charitable foundation. The Hagia Sophia attracted the interest of travelers and researches visiting this city for hundreds of years. Evliya Çelebi (1648), Pitton de Tournefort (1701), Hamilton (1836), Texier (1864), Şakir Şevket of Trabzon (1878) and Lynch (1893) were among those people whose writings on Trabzon are famous and who appreciated this building.\n\nIt is known that the mosque that had been in ruins was renovated in 1864 upon the encouragement of Rıza Efendi of Bursa. During the World War I, it was used as a storehouse, a hospital and later again as a mosque, successively. Between 1958 and 1962 it was restored.",
