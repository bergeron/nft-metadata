    "description": "\nTHE AMETHYST ROOM\n✸ Living Room ✸\n\nIt’s currently mid day. A music box tune plays on the record table. And the candle on the coffee tables cannot be burnt. Just like the amethyst crystal this room provides stress relief and clarity in both the mental and metaphysical dimension.\n\n✰ PREFACE ✰ \nStrange things have been happening to Lucy ever since her beloved grandmother passed away recently. Her cat will not shush, the lamp in her room keeps flickering and she received a very strange note on her pillow. Can you help her find where the note came from? \n\n✸ The note reads ✸\n“Lucy, come find me.”\n\n✰ 1/1 made by THE MYSTIC ✰\n",
