    "description": "Introduction:\nThere are 50 works in total, and the name of the work is the address of the residents. You can search the address on Google Map to find the specific address of the residential building, or search the address on Baidu Map to see its appearance in the panoramic photo through its panoramic map function.\n\nInspiration:\nMy photos of residential buildings in Beijing, built in the 1990s, have been post-processed so that they match the color of the sky while maintaining the color of the buildings themselves. The buildings are shaped like Legos, full of geometric cubes, and have a high density of rooms. They are mostly light-colored and look like city cakes. Old as these buildings are, they have a unique beauty of time.",
