    "description": "Just watching at this artwork is like taking a journey through different dimensions where a story of another past, another time in a parallel future, is told. These spheres, which symbolize other consciences, are still in the Asomatic cosmos, the intangible realm from which each of us originated. When we are still in our immaterial form, the only thing we need to evolve is material experience. This will enable our consciences to gather essential knowledge that they can then use to program a biological engineering robot called the body. Each conscience can reside safely inside this one-of-a-kind transportation device and explore the material dimension thanks to this program, which is called DNA.",
