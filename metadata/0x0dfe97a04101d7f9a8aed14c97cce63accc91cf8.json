    "description": "The skull symbolizes my brain, which refuses to believe that the art that I create is at least needed by someone. And as if suppressing the creative path in me. And it kills the artist in me. And the flower is my heart. It kind of breaks my skull from the inside and makes my brain believe that the art I created is beautiful, that they are worth something, that they benefit the world around them. I believe. Thanks.\n\n My brain tells me nobody needs your art. But the heart believes that they benefit the world.",
