    "description": "I was raised in poetry. Live and direct, in your face spoken word poetry. I was the youngest poet in Sacramento history to be crowned the Mahogany Urban Poetry Queen of the Mic. It has always been my duty to free up our culture through my art.  A proud representative of a people who are too commonly portrayed as hypersexual, undesirable, and sexually deviant in mainstream society, our purposeful exploration of sex and pleasure is an act of advocacy. Through providing a soundtrack for body positivity, intimacy, and pleasure, I aim to uplift people to live our proudest, sexiest, and most fulfilled lives. This song is a dedication to living a feature-film worth life in every moment of the day.",
