    "description": "SportKids is an NFT work created by Japanese digital artist Nomura Mako for the 2022 Qatar World Cup, a limited series of 10,000 digital collectibles on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Sportkids is unique and randomly generated. 2022 is an unusual year. Diseases, wars, and hunger are threatening all human beings at all times. Football has always been a carrier of peace and hope. Nomura Mako plans to use 50% of the sales proceeds of this NFT to support homeless children in Ukraine through Savethechildren; 50% will be used for community operations and future planning of the project",
