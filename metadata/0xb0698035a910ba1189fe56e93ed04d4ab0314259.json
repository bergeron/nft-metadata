    "description": "February 5, 2081\n\nTwo days ago the Westminster Police Department of London got a unique video record at their disposal. It might shed a beam of light at the sensational case of disappearance of Tero Scheldkuf, novice at St. Tailor School of the Noble Occupations University.\n\nHere is what Mr Vague, cyber forensic analyst of the WPD, told us:\n\n\"The source file was recorded directly from the cerebral cortex implant of the victim, the moment before his vanishing. It was then heavily edited, EXIF data completely erased. We received this entry as an anonymous letter. Apparently, it is a message from the kidnapper, a coded key to this dark mystery we faced.\"\n\nWith the permission of the WPD Chief, we are publishing this record here, to allow our dear readers to make their own efforts for its interpretation. We ask you to send the results of your research to our official mailbox. Noteworthy options will be reviewed for the Sundayâ€™s special column.\n\nWritten by\nH. Arhofth, NOC Pages.",
