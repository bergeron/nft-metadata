    "description": "EXGOMI Machina X Mk 1 is a photo series documenting a 1:1 robot bust created by Ben Fisher. The sculpture is an assemblage created using parts sourced from a constantly growing abundance of hard rubbish, e-waste, and other miscellaneous discarded materials. The process of altering existing forms into a new configuration presents the viewer with a new narrative, and gives waste a new life.",
