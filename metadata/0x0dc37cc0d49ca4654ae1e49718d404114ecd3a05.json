    "description": "Technique: Digital collage (photomontage)\nunlockable content digital image high resolution\n\nWithin these images, fantasy and reality are intertwined in such a way that one cannot distinguish between them.  They convey a feeling as if we no longer have a sense of what reality is.\n \nMy digital collages are a combination of a playful act with photographic experimentation, based on a kind of urban utopia with a certain expressionist tendency. It is through this utopia that I try to create a fusion between photography and my particular vision of bourgeois daily life, in which I introduce myself, while inducing others to voyeurism, to live the experience of the characters and objects portrayed.\n\nI manage to reconcile such dissimilar elements, because I collect the photographs and illustrations of the objects and characters that I later include in my visual constructions, giving way to my own \"cabinet of curiosities\" \n\nIn this work the image of the portrayed is multiplied as he like\n\n\n\n\n",
