    "description": "You see the miracle of nature, a single palm tree in the desert that leads to the sea. This tree was a symbol in the deserts of Irene, unfortunately this tree no longer exists. I took this photo in 2016 in the southernmost desert of Iran called Derak.\n\nThese photos are the result of 10 years of photography and travel to desert areas of Iran. Hot and impassable deserts that sometimes reach temperatures of 70 degrees Celsius",
