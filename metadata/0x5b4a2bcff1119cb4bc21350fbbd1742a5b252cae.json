    "created_by": "Brarez",
    "description": "Small & Giant is inspired by the work La Materia Poteva Non Esserci by Pietro Consagra, created for Fiumara D'Arte in 1986.  \nThe original work is a majestic sculpture composed of two elements, leaning against each other and parallel, coloured black and white, in a delicate harmony of empty and full.\n\nAs I walked down the road to visit the work, I began to see it from the road, small and isolated, and the closer I got, the bigger it became.\n\nIt is like the perception of one's own problems that from small become giants and only with hindsight do you realise that it all depends on the perspective with which one looks at things.\n\nThe collector will receive a small 14x14 cm print.",
