    "description": "On a select few days every year, the sun aligns perfectly on the street grid in Manhattan. This alignment provides us with this spectacular phenomenon known as Manhattanhenge. On these special days, traffic stops, people crowd the streets, and photographers swarm to their favorite spots. It's as if the city that never sleeps stops dead in its tracks to admire one of Mother Nature's finest displays. It lasts mere moments, but to the viewers, it's a moment they will never forget.",
