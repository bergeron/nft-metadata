    "description": "PlayTiger is the Genesis NFT on MusicY, which is limited to 999 pieces total.\n\nThe cover of each PlayTiger is designed by a mysterious niche artist named Kris and are created by a unique algorithm that enables them to have varieties. There will be some extremely rare accessories that will make a few NFTs more exclusive. Each PlayTiger will come with a Crypto Heartbeat sound. The data in it comes from transactions on the blockchain(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin). Some can contribute Crypto Heartbeat to their favourite or meaningful PlayTiger. PlayTiger's Crypto heartbeat sound paired with Morse code must be a signal from a mysterious species deep in the universe directed to earthlings! And there are only 6 such NFTs in the world!!!\n\nHash-0000000000000121e2f5ef 521097d21a1a2497d655b13321e1 c9ab914abe26cb",
