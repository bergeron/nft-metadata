    "description": "Buy this NFT artwork to stop the unfair burning of Mother Nature's treasure in Ukraine! We donate all profits to volunteer organisations who support Ukrainian women right now. As you know, most of our models are from this colorful land and today they are praying all together for their husbands, fathers, brothers and children who are fighting for their home! They are praying for saving their lives, their families and the cultural heritage they kept for many years. Ukrainian women carry in their hands and pass on through generations their magic culture, they are the angels of Ненька Україна🕊️ Pray for the most precious gems of our beautiful world! 🙏🇺🇦 Stand against the unfair war for saving the fragile hearts of Ukrainian women.\n\n\"No! I live! I will live forever! I have a heart that does not die\". Lesia Ukrainka (Forest Song, 1911)",
