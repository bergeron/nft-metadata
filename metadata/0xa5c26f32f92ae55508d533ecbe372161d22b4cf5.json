    "description": "Putting a 100% of yourself into anything is a very taxing endeavor. In giving everything you have to one goal you see how much there is to accomplish. Chasing your ideal of perfection is a very tough ambition to commit to. Once you make the decision to go after these aspirations though you start to see results and growth. Realizing the fruits of your labor almost feels like power swelling up inside you. At long last you accomplish what you what you made up your mind to do, and the end result always blows you away.",
