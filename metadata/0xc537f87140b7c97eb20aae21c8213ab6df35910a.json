    "description": "Elemental Witches - Earth\n\nShe is the Earth witch, a spirit of the forest, a goddess of vegetation & wilderness. She dwells in the thick forests, tending to the plant life & the critters, making the flora & fauna blossom, healing the wilderness. She nurtures the sacred connection between nature & humanity. She is one with nature. \n\n\nWitches Symbolism\n\nWitch hunts largely began in the 16th century. Women were generally perceived as weak willed & easily corruptible. Those who didn't fit the societal norms were deemed as tainted by the devil. This included women who were too wealthy, too poor, who had no children, or had too many children, women who weren't meek & submissive. To this day, the term witch is thrown around as an insult for women who are unconventional.\nTo me, a witch symbolizes a woman who realizes her power, who draws strength from sources outside of the men she is supposed to serve. A woman who finds strength in nature, vocation, rituals, elements, among other things.",
