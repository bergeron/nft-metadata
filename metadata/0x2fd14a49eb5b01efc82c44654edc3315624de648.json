    "description": "This art piece, in the Pinstripe style and composed only of red, black and white colors, depicts a solitary woman walking on a dark path among trees in the light of the moon. The work represents the idea that even when people are alone and in the dark, they still hold hope and seek a brighter future. The trees symbolize the difficulties and obstacles in one's life, while the moonlight represents hope and light. This piece sends a message of hope that even in dark times, one can find a path towards the light.",
