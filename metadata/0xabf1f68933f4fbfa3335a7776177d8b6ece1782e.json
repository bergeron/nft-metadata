    "description": "CHAPTER 1: WORLD BUILDING \n\nIn this world, there is no clear line between what's real and what is not. The wind blowing, can be seen and heard but not felt. The grass is crystalized, shining under the sun but wont prick or cut. The skies will bring in the light but not the warmth. Your vision brings life to this world. Your choices define how you interact. Although one thing is certain. Divine Creator energy embodies this place. A story finds form & life.",
