    "description": "The floor is collapsing. The sweeping has stopped. You thought the project would explode, but it ended up being a dud.\n\nPeople are getting sucked into a pipe-dreams thinking that the project will moon - and that dream has since been shattered. \n\nBut don't fret! Act fast, spend the gas, and navigate this treacherous terrain.\n\nIf you can avoid the insanity, slow-moving blockchains and naysayers - you might just get out of this unscathed. \n\nJust continue rolling on the floor, laughing.",
