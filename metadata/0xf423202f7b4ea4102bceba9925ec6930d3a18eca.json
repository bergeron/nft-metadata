Each photo shows a statue of a funerary monument at the Fiumei út National Cemetery, Budapest, Hungary. Through an elaborate composition of my images, I try to give \"life\" to these statues. The title of this series \"The water flows, the stones remain\" and my photographs are an allegory of the brevity of our lives.",
