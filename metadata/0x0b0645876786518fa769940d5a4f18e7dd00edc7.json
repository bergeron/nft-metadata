    "description": "The compass has helped people throughout history. Thanks to the compass, people have entered into new searches. New discoveries have been made thanks to the compass. People felt safe with the compass. We also see a couple in this photo. Their love for each other is evident from their looks. I wonder if their compass was my heart filled with love? Is this how they found love? We can't know this. But the compass will not cease to help everyone today as it was in the past.\nWith this photograph, I came second in the 3rd International Skylife Photography Contest organized by Turkish Airlines and represented my country at the top. The photograph traveled all over the world on Turkish Airlines planes.\n\nCamera: Canon\nCamera Settings: f/5.6 1/250sec iso-100\nDate: 04.06.2015\nFile: jpeg\nLocation: Istanbul\nEdition: 1/1\nImage Size: 4659x3060\n300dpi",
