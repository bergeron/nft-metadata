    "description": "This is my reinterpretation of the work Piet√† and at the same time a tribute to Michelangelo Buonarroti, one of the greatest artists of all time, with this work I try to imitate the serenity and balance of the original piece, looking for an apparent absence of suffering, and framing it in an aesthetic of Ukiyo-e style, changing by Japanese references the Virgin Mary and the body of Jesus, using Kannon, Goddess of mercy, Fudo Myoo, one of the kings of wisdom and protective deity of Buddhism, closing the central figure with a dragon as a symbol of benevolence and completing the composition with the waves embracing on both sides the central figure to settle the sense of balance and that the central weight falls on the goddess who serenely contemplates the scene.",
