    "description": "Snail shell was created in 2018. It shows a miracle of nature, the \"spira mirabilis\" (clockwise). It is a spiral in which, with each revolution around its center, the distance from that center changes by the same factor. Bernoulli (1655-1705) gave it the name \"miracle spiral\".\n\nThe absolute tip of a shell of a small freshwater snail can be seen. The magnification is about 3:1. A homemade lens based on Zeiss Luminar attachments was used to emphasize the special colors and shades. \n\nSnail shell has a resolution of 4000 * 3000 pixels @ 300 dpi.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
