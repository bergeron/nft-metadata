    "description": "\"It's ours now, you ain't using it right!\"\n\n[Sacred Milk] toys with the relationship to this strange translucent goo us mammals seem do a little better with, than without. Mythologies and belief systems seem in perpetual orbit around it's very existence. It does seem important. What secrets are waiting to gush forth from realities teat in the wake of future discoveries? Maybe its all just white goo. \n\nDon't let that Milk out of your sight!\n\nI've created soundscape befitting a B-Movie to vibe with this piece so feel free to crank the volume.\n\nVisuals and Music - CKx",
