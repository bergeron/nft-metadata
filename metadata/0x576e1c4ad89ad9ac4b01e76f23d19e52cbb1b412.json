    "description": "\"Ultra Kawaii girls!!!\"\n\nI really wanted to see Luv chan and my Megami, Tako chan from Megami #06002, together, so I used all my available powers to draw them super cute!\nDrawing my inner Kwaii to the fullest makes me the happiest!\nThis is how I want to see them! I love being able to express what I want to see!\nThis is exactly what painting is all about.\n\nI am grateful to the MEGAMI team and Naoki Saito for creating Tako chan and for making it possible for me to paint this picture. Thank you so much!\n\n\nーーーーーーーーーーーーー\nThis NFT artwork comes with a 2.5D aluminum art panel produced by GASHO 2.0.\n\nThe right to claim the actual artwork produced is included with the primary NFT bidder.\n\nIf you would like to receive your 2.5D art panel, please\nPlease fill out this form to receive your item.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/WmddiS8J9zWWvdpa9\n\nGASHO 2.0 is here\nhttps://twitter.com/GASHO_2_0\nーーーーーーーーーーーーー",
