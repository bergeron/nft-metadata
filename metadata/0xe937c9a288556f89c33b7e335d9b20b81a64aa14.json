    "description": "'If You Forget Me', takes the title of a Pablo Neruda poem that resonated with me at a timely point.\n\nDuring the process of the UK leaving Europe, I was in the process of relocating from England to France.\n\nI love the UK, my birth home, but was falling out of love with where it was headed. Neruda's poem, in my personal interpretation of it, seemed to perfectly encapsulate where I was in my relationship with my country.\n\nThroughout this time I was constantly making photographs that were coloured by my fluctuating emotional state.  This collection is curated visual response to those feelings.\n\n\"...Well, now,\nif little by little you stop loving me\nI shall stop loving you little by little...\"\n  \n~ Pablo Neruda, 1952",
