For Gradient Mornings, I created 12 shapes using gradients from colors in MAYC #3040 as my building blocks.\n\nI then composed 1 work/day for 10 days. Each new piece involved the rearrangement of shapes from the previous day. All works were named after the entire collection was created. \n\n1 - pergola\n2 - taraxacum\n3 - weighted average illusion\n4 - circle packing theorem\n5 - equipoise\n6 - multivariate\n7 - osmosis\n8 - appulse\n9 - index of refraction\n10 - cactoideae",
