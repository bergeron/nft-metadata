    "description": "As I was starting to work on [Zupermat](https://0xphiiil.art/zupermat) in the dead of winter, I was searching for a visual texture to express a supreme sense of overwhelming power and calmness. Proto Zupermat is the moment where I first saw those lights. Commit. Push. Screenshot.\n\nMonths later, as Zupermat came to a resting point, I stumbled on the screenshot in my camera roll and took notice of how much the series had changed since those first moments. I searched for that old commit in the code history and branched from that moment in time to create Proto Zupermat.\n\nThe three pieces of Proto Zupermat represent a point in time in the birth of a generative series.\n\n2022\n4800 x 4800px",
