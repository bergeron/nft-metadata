    "description": "The seven chakras are the vital energy centers in the human body and each one of them controls a different aspect of our being. When these centers are balanced, we experience a sense of wellbeing and peace. To help bring about this balance, I created \"Inner Sanctum\"  as a series of digital artworks of one of the seven chakras blossoming into existence.",
