    "description": "Genesis 1:1 “Let there be light”\n-\nThe \"Creation of worlds\" series is a result of a meticulous exploration of the experimental photographic process Cliché-Verre. The process consists in creating an image by various means on a transparent surface, such as glass or viewfoil, and then placed on light-sensitive paper in a photographic darkroom before exposing it to light. This acts as a photographic negative.\n-\nDue to the liquid state of the inks and other materials used in the compositions, the time window for each print was extremely short, allowing the creation of only one unique piece.\n-\nIn addition, the collector will receive a high resolution and digitally calibrated scanned image [11642x 9181px 1000dpi].
