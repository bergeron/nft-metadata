    "description": "The series Variegation is inspired by the nightlife of foliage, a glimpse of what we might see if our night vision had evolved exponentially. After the sun fades, the process of photosynthesis stops and respiration begins. Plants begin to burn their stored sugars, assimilating some of the precious oxygen they created during the day. In darkness growth continues, with careful calibration of the rate at which a plant’s fuel reserves are burnt. The colours I have used in this series represent the light absorbed into the plant’s structure and its conversion to energy. The title Variegation refers to the multiple colours across a plant’s leaves or stems - representing levels of chlorophyll in the plant directly affecting the gathering and burning of energy.",
