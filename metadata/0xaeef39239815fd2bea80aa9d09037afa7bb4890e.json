    "description": "iKu (Conceived by Ai.output):\n\nBlue Bic pens lie still,  \nSilent witnesses to our end,  \nHuman race erased.\n\nOrigin story  \nSpiral notebook catharsis  \nPoor freak sans blue blood\n\n2048 x 2732 digital ballpoint ink on glitch leaf notebook paper\n\n*Deoxygenated blood is dark red & not blue, but let’s pretend that it is because if we don’t it will ruin everything.\n\nBefore computer blood was digitized & made available to produce glitch gifs, a future crypto artist would scratch away at ruled notebook paper & attempt to soulfully saturated it with the most beautiful indigo fluid known to a hormonal teenage creative outcast, ballpoint nectar.\n\nThis particular crypto artist to be obviously preferred red ink, but that was outlawed by the teaching class for RED was reserved for their savage correcting scribble. So Blue it was. Cheap & easily replaceable. NO ERASER, full throttle. Back then you drew what you meant & worked shit out on paper while the rest of the class followed suit & inhaled the command spores. Amongst the countless blue pages of angst & imagination fodder, you would find the occasional class note, but planted artistic doodle seeds could be witnessed in mass abundance.\n\nThe Blue BIC Origin pieces celebrate those who went hard in their notebooks back in the day & honors the rare & strange few that cultivated said seeds & continued slinging ink in the face of adversity, turning the blue blood red.\n\nCPU BL00D: (BLUE))  \nOrigins: BIC, Ballpoint  \n0010010010010010010010  \n1001010010101  \n101010010101  \n10101  \n1010010100101010100100001001010101  \n10111010010101  \n10100100100101001001001.vBBW.APOC.RETURNTONUANCE.EXE",
