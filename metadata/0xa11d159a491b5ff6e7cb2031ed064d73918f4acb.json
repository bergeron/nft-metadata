    "description": "Dearest Reader, \nI think about how many cords have strung and how many beats have skipped for our paths to cross. If my art could do anything, I hope it creates a fork in your road. Where it leads I do not know, but I hope  that through my expression I can give you the freedom of choice. Whether it frees you or cages you, that is up to you. I realize we make decisions often. From the moment you woke up to the moment you read this letter. I have a lot to say, but I have more to write; if this letter goes to you my Reader, I promise to write to you for the rest of my days. Perhaps this fork will lead us closer. Regardless, today the choice I make is one of freedom. I shall not contemplate which forks I did not walk across, but which paths I will create. I don‚Äôt deserve to be caged by my decisions and neither do you. Sometimes my writing leaves me confused but we Khan be confused together. How funny is it that in pursuit of answers we are left with more questions. \n\nLove,\nBushra Khan\n",
