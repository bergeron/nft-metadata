    "description": "A contest piece I entered for a Clair Silver contest. I did not win but I'm really happy on how this piece turned out. Its part of my exploration of geometry and abstract surreal art. The contest was about creating a piece that was a rebuttal to an anti AI statement. I wanted to show that not all AI art is the same and you can create intricate unique pieces that break from the mold of what AI art can be. I hope you enjoy it!",
