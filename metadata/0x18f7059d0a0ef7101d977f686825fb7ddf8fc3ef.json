    "description": "MO2RA /w Oi Mansi\nHow machines perceive shapes and the invisible strings of human beauty. Through collaborations with photographers, MO2RA series explores the art of the soma.\n\n«Like always in Erotic photography i like when the poses aren’t scripted, the clothing not chosen by a stylist and the makeup done by the model herself. Everything you see on this picture is chosen by the model, it is purely the way she likes to tease, the way she likes to communicate with her body.  To me this is the true form of transporting desire and temptation within photographic images.» - Oi Mansi\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the entire work.\nThe particle flows are generated with the multilayer data extracted from the original photo. Music was created with the Magenta and influenced by parsed image data.",
