    "description": "Life is precious and precarious at the same time. After staying in my comfortable and peaceful shell for a really long time and healed a lot when I tried to stick out my neck I realized that I'm at the crossroads where one direction leads to the yellow road and the other to the peaceful solitude.\n\nWhat should I do? Only time will tell if a middle path exists.",
