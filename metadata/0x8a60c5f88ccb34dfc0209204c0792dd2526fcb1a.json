    "description": "“Computer Science (Death of)”, is composed of 100 unique generative artworks. The collection showcases the autonomous creative abilities of AI, free from human creative influence, culminating in a series of generative art pieces coded in p5js. The art was born from an elaborate iterative process, where AI was tasked to conceive, code, debug, and refine its own artistic concepts, constrained only by its maximum single response output.Imperfections in the artworks are intentionally preserved, symbolizing the raw and unrefined creativity of these early AI models. This collection serves as a historical snapshot capturing the frontier of AI's creative coding potential in 2023.",
