    "description": "Loss, memory, and dreams are the central themes of my work. My constant goal is to capture the ephemeral, disconcerting, melancholic, and surreal nature of dreams and memories through the distortion and destruction of analog and digital images. I have always been fascinated by the power that dream images and memories have on me. This fascination has led me to experiment with photography, trying to represent the atmospheres of these intangible worlds. The use of digital intervention and artificial intelligence has allowed me to create these dreamscapes, where vision is rarely clear, and identities are blurred by the noise of the mind. The physical destruction of the image serves as an analogy to the ephemeral and finite condition of memory. I work with the tools of the present while staying firmly anchored to the past.\n\n\n\n Year: 2023\n\nEdition: NFT 1 of 1\n\nCopyright: © 2023 Andres Hernandez.
