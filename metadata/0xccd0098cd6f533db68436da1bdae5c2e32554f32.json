    "description": "In 1952 Alan Turing wrote a paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in which he described a theory of how patterns, such as dots or stripes, can arise in homogeneous systems under certain conditions.\n\nIn this generative art work one hundred and twenty eight Turing patterns at various scales co-operate and compete to produce a dynamic structure.\n\nThis work is 1080 by 1080 pixels at 25 frames per second, and one minute duration.",
