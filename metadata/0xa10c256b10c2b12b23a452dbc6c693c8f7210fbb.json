    "description": "Originally hand drawn, this piece was scanned in 24 separate sections, each of which was pieced together in photoshop and refined to make a high quality linear artwork.\n\nThe digital artwork measures 120cm and can be printed at this scale.\n\nPurchase of this NFT on primary includes a 1/1 Gicl√©e print of the artwork (up to A2 size) signed by the artist and shipped rolled in a strong paper tube.\n\nI love working on large scale artworks of New York City and this aerial perspective is one of the most intriguing to me.
