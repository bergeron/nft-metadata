    "description": "Traces of Truth comprises 500 portraits of twins, each adorned with cameras born of dystopian utility, as a universal metaphor for the tension between resemblance and recognition- asking questions about the cameraâ€™s influence on our culture, self-awareness, our subservience to its power, the nature of photography and our relationship to truth.
