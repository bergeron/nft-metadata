    "description": "Blink\nI begin with a poem I composed about this piece;\n\nLong before the great shift of reality was set in motion, long before the substance of life was abandoned by the gravity of grace.\n\nThe weight of the heavens was turned into tears and silence like stardust fell from her face.\n\nThough we think we can see life coming and believe we can predict the future with analysis and statistics, we are always surprised at what happens in the blink of an eye.  Painting is just that for me.  I never know where I am going until I get there, and there it happens in a blink of an eye.\n\nCollection: Once in a Blue Moon\nArtist: Russell Dâ€™Alessio\nSize: 3020 x 3024 pixels\nType: JPEG\nFor the latest updates on about my art follow me on twitter, Instagram or visit my website;  http://www.rdalessioart.com\n",
