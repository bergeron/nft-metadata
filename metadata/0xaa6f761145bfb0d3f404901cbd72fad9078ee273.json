    "description": "Day 7 - Two Artists & a Puppy\n\nThis piece was inspired by you, the artist who is looking at this artist with her little dog.\n\nThis piece was created with you in mind, the artist at heart. We all have an innate desire to create, and this piece celebrates that truth. It's a reminder that every human is an artist in their own right, and I've worked to bring that idea to life.\n\nAs you take in the happy flowers blooming from the building and see the giant photographer and his little dog capturing the moment, I hope you feel inspired and recognized. This piece is about my own journey as an artist, and my goal is to encourage you to embrace your own creativity and see yourself as the artist you were always meant to be.\n\nSo take a moment to appreciate your own creative nature, and remember that every step you take in your artistic journey is worth celebrating.\n\nThis is my first experiment intervening a photograph made by me, with illustration.\n\n1% Happier Collection",
