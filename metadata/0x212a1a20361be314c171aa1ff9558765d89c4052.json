    "description": "Cool breeze passed by, \nIt inspired my kite to fly.\n\n\nBreezin' is a collection that explores the styles of decorative breeze blocks that are found on the exterior of homes in Barbados.These blocks, though found around the world, have become a part of Barbados' Architectural cultural identity.
