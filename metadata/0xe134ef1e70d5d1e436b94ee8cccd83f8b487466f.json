    "description": "This work combines my love of painting with collecting things from nature. It attempts to express the thoughts a feelings our mind can weave together as we experience the simple moments in life like walking through nature.  The small details that might capture our attention and bring us a moment of joy. Inspired by the abstract expressionist movement I am interested in the emotive potency of colour and texture, a simple but powerful way to express mood.\n\n1/1\n3024 x 4032\n\n",
