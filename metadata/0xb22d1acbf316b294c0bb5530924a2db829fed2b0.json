    "description": "Is a vision directly inspired by the powerful vibes and spirit that flow in festivalsâ€™ dancefloors. \nPast, present and future merge and ego dissolves in a suspended, ecstatic experience, while dancing the connectedness of all things. \n\nWater, earth and sky compenetrate through warm and growling sound frequencies, generating electro-magnetic signals, linking the ground, to the plants, to our bodies.\n\n\n",
