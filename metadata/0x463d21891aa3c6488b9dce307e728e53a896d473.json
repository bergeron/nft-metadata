    "description": "I've been around the world  \nA couple of times or maybe more  \nI've seen the sights, I've had delights  \nOn every foreign shore  \nBut when my mates all ask me  \nThe place that I adore  \nI tell them right away  \nGive me a home among the gumtrees  \nWith lots of plum trees  \nA sheep or two, a k-kangaroo  \nA clothesline out the back  \nVerandah out the front  \nAnd an old rocking chair  \nYou can see me in the kitchen  \nCooking up a roast  \nOr Vegemite on toast  \nJust you and me, a cup of tea  \nAnd later on, we'll settle down  \nAnd go out on the porch  \nAnd watch the possums play  \nThere's a Safeways up the corner  \nAnd a Woolies down the street  \nAnd a brand new place they've opened up  \nWhere they regulate the heat  \nBut I'd trade them all tomorrow  \nFor a little bush retreat  \nWhere the kookaburras call  \nSome people like their houses  \nWith fences all around  \nOthers live in mansions  \nAnd some beneath the ground  \nBut me I like the bush you know  \nWith rabbits running round  \nAnd a pumpkin vine out the back\n\nLicense: With the purchase of this NFT, the artist provides the primary holder the licensing rights to sell, trade, or transfer the NFT on the blockchain, and can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of members.
