    "description": "Quiggly, chameleon of the sea, is one of the characters from a children’s book I’m writing.\nA book inspired by a beautiful seaside village in Wales, Llangrannog, and a very brave little lady. \n\nAt 13 months old my Godchild, Calypso, received the precious gift of an organ transplant, allowing her to live the best life possible.  Days stuck in a hospital were made brighter by listening to stories her Mom read. The joy that these stories gave was treasured.  It showed that reading is a magical time for children in hospital. \n\nWhat started as the idea of a special book for Calypso evolved into being able to give the gift of a book (escapism with a spoonful of hope) to children in hospital.\nTo raise the money to reach this goal, I’m going to make NFTs out of paintings of the characters from the children’s book.  A percentage of the money made will go towards having the books printed.  Calypso will do the honors of gifting the books on one of her check-ups at Leeds Children’s hospital.  \n",
