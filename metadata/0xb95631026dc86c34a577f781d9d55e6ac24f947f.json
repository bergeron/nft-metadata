    "description": "There is a lot of pain But there is something hidden in that feeling. \"Pain helps you recognize pleasure\" If you felt happy all the time, you wouldn't recognize it as happiness. You need to experience the opposite end of the spectrum sometimes to be able to truly recognize and appreciate happiness... And sometimes this feeling is in the form of farewells. as when people split up saying 'See you again,' Typically, it does not. It's comparable to love. If you truly love someone and they want to leave anyway. But because you love them, you will never make them worried about anything. You will let it be, no matter how much it hurts you. Accepting pain with pleasure is similar.",
