    "description": "Moullinex and Xinobi are back to collaborating together. The latest tracks produced at their own Discotexas studio headquarters in Lisbon, are ‘Extinction Event' which comes paired with 'NSSS' continuing their long running partnership marking their first joint outing in over a year. With tongues firmly in their cheeks they hail the single as “our musical interpretation of the apocalypse” which some might say gives way to some truly apocalyptic house music as they contemplate dancing in the face of such a catastrophic event.",
