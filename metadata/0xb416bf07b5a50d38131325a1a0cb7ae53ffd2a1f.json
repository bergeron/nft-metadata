    "description": "The main subject in this work draws from a collection of objects that serve as symbols of legitimacy in the traditional art world, the world before Metaverse: logos of major art institutions that legitimise an artist's repute, symbols of the three strongest world currencies, paddles of global auction houses that represent the legitimacy of an artwork's value in the market. \n \nThis collection of iconographies is embellished on several parts of the totem stack—an imagined object of worship. Evoking what some cultures use as vessels for ancestral spirits, Hahan uses the totem symbol to excavate deep-rooted beliefs in the art world, reappraising what has long been considered sacred and powerful.  \n \nThe glowing arrows stabbing into the totem represent the new technologies and value recording systems that are developing today. Blockchain and cryptocurrency are arguably shaking the existing financial system—and could potentially dominate the future. \n\nYet the position of the totem floating and oscillating in the galaxy was a deliberate visual choice of Hahan: it represents a transitional period; the co-existence of  the mainstream system, which has long operated on a hierarchical structure; and new technology, which strives for ‘common power’ and self-governed currency.",
