    "name": "Susanoo vs Yamata no Orochi",
    "description": "Kicked from the garden of paradise, Susanoo, one of Izanagi's children, descended to the top of Mount Torikami and met an old couple, Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi and their daughter wept bitterly. They also explained that they were tired of every year when Yamata-no-Orochi came to eat their children, and this time they had to sacrifice their ninth child, Kusinada.\n\nIn order to save Kusinada, Susanoo married her and transform her into a comb which she tucked in her hair.\nIn a drunken state, Susanoo slashed all of its necks. \n\nAfter being defeated, Susanoo pulled out his sword, and now the sword has been transformed into a powerful sword called Kusanagi.",
