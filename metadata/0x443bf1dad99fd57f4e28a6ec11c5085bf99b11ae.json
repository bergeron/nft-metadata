    "description": "This piece evokes the tranquility of a traditional Japanese garden, while also suggesting a dreamlike and fantastical quality, as if the viewer is entering a magical world where the koi fish are larger than life and imbued with mystical powers.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus."
