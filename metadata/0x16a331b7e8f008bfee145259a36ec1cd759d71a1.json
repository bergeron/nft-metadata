    "description": "In the days of chthulucene...\n\nNeuron wraps itself with a sticky tentacle, grabbing \"Man\", \"Nature\" and other irregularities. Wetly grinding them into an indistinguishable compost, melting hierarchies, eliminating distances and boundaries, it exposes the tentacular network of  existence of everything-with-everything. Noises of large narratives are going on an LC-odyssey to repose through equalization.\n\n'Natural Therapy of Design' is a collection I extracted from a tentacular network trained on a trillion chthulocycles.",
