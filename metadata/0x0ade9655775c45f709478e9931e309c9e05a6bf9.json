    "description": "The Ta'lig script, in combination with the transcript, created the Nasta'liq. Nasta'liq point has artistically been the scale of Persian letters design by moving, rotating, and pulling the pen. This work of art is a poetic and abstract elucidation of Persian calligraphy in the laud of artists whose scripts are full of tolerance and patience, as the movement of their pens, the patience of the noble individuals of Iran.",
