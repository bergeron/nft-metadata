    "description": "AI.S.A.M is an London based AI photographer, 3D artist and creative. His work draws on themes of decay, loss and the supernatural. They use AI to challenge what is real and artificial, to push boundaries of traditional artistic practice and challenge preconceived notions of what is possible with technology.\n\nThis edition commemorates NFTNYC. The work is a simulacra of America, a reflection of film, tv, news and books."
