    "description": "Richard's collection of Korean landscape paintings. All of the art in this collection was created using AI and programming. Unlike other AI arts, he just used AI as a tool and tried to capture Richard's unique emotions and thoughts. I hope you see this as an art that contains Richard's thoughts. In this collection, only 8 works are scheduled to be mint, and when 8 titles are collected, one phrase is completed. Hope you enjoy what it means when the 8 are put together.",
