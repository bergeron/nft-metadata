    "description": "\"Broken ribs are about life being more than we can handle.\"\n\nThe ribs are one of the most important bones in the human body. They surround and protect the organs in the chest, lungs and heart, so they are like your sentinels, guarding your inner being.\n\nThe ribs hold spiritual significance too. The heart region represents the emotions; the lungs area represents the relationship with the outside, and rib pain represents your boundaries. When your personal space is invaded, you experience pain or other pressure on the rib cage. It means that there are times that you need to adapt to some changes and take some steps to adjust to your boundaries.",
