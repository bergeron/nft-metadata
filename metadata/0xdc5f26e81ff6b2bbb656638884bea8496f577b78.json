    "description": "Chapter 1 - Visions of Eternity\n\nEternity, a soothing and comforting thought for many. While upon closer inspection, it might come to be understood as tiring and exhausting. It is the process of change that revitalises and refreshes, does Eternity offer that eternally? If so, will that not become monotonous, too, in the film of Eternity as eventually all of the possible eventualities will be explored? What follows after this conscious experience, nobody knows. An Eternity of conscious experience or an Eternity of nothingness? Whatever it might be, the hard and soft beauty will remain long after we are gone while the hopes of many grow the branches of the Eternal tree.",
