    "description": "Created for Claire Silver's AI Art Contest, the title and subject allude to the fleeting nature of time and how, in the blink of an eye, an entire life can pass you by. The looping portrait depicts a woman holding a mobile phone. In the beginning, we see her in her youth, eyes cast downward, focused on her phone in an all too familiar posture today. As the image changes and the woman ages, she suddenly looks up, contemplation playing on her face. What is she thinking? Is she pondering her squandered youth? Or is she present and focused on the time remaining? Is her gaze distant, lost in thought? Or does she see the viewer, give them her full attention?  \n\nDuring the contest, lorepunk.eth was inspired to write the following poem: \n\nA witch showed  \nme how my future  \nwould goâ€”the  \nfirst times I  \nwatched, fear  \ngripped my shoulders,  \nthen I noticed  \nthe spaces between,  \nand understood  \nwhat remains  \nthe same, old  \nand young,  \nis the will  \nto love, to watch,  \nto set right,  \nto live",
