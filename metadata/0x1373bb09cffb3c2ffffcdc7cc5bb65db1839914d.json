    "description": "Blue Dragon\n1/1\n3600 x 4200\n31 MB\n\nInspired by Japan’s rich history and tradition of fashion accessories ‘NETSUKE’ is a collection imagined with the novel technology of Ai fused with historical research. \n\nEmerging as a practical solution to dressing in 17th-century Japan, Netsuke are miniature sculptures, ornate fasteners that sit on the cords of an inro box attached to a man’s kimono. Over time, these objects became treasures of exquisite craftsmanship and were highly collectable, signalling their owners' interests, discernment, & relative wealth. \n\nThis collection references Japanese & East Asian history, art & craftsmanship depicting flora & fauna, ghosts, demons, and myth. ‘NETSUKE’ plays with the boundaries of traditional artefacts by drawing historical art form into contemporary technology and imagination bringing a whole new meaning to the idea of ‘digital collectables’.
