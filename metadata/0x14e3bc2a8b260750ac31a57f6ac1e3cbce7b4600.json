    "description": "This is the Future Galerie AirOrb Membership Pass. It was initially airdropped to early members of our community.\n\n\n\nFuture Galerie is a contemporary, immersive, and digital art exhibition that explores cutting-edge methodologies for how art is being created and culture is experienced. Our exhibitions and programming are the site of innovation and shared cultural experience that fosters a genuine connection with a core creative community while maintaining accessibility to the general population.\n\n\n\nWith artwork created by Adrian Stein (@looneystein), the Future Galerie AirOrb is your entry into token-gated perks at IRL Future Galerie exhibitions and events. Each time you scan your pass at a Future Galerie experience, your membership will advance to new stages and unlock additional benefits for future programs.\n\n\n\nThe stages of this pass are Member, Contributor, Maker, and Founder. If you sell your membership on the secondary market, it will automatically revert to a Member level.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, the only way to be issued Future Galerie AirOrb Membership Passes is through an invitation from existing holders at critical times in the Future Galerie brand evolution.",
