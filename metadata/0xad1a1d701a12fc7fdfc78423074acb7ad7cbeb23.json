    "description": "This NFT is based on a photo I took and then modified on Photoshop with my unique dot colorful style.\n\nI took this photo on a trip I made on January 2022 to Curumaní on the department of Cesar, Colombia. In that moment I was entranced by the beauty of the landscapes on this region of Colombia.\n\nI strongly recommend to visit Colombia, there are so many beautiful places to enjoy.\n\n-Buitrago\n\nP.S. This NFT includes a special gift to first holder. DM me on twitter (@buitrago91) for more info.",
