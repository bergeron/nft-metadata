    "description": "You are living in a digital prison. Break free from your chains.\n\nIn The Animal Kingdom, there are predators and prey. Which beast are you? What role do you play in the wild? \n\nAre you a fierce Lion that hunts down your prey with patience and confidence? Or are you a Gazelle, grazing in the field, living in fear, hoping that you donâ€™t get killed before you make it back to the herd safely?\n\nWe are being brainwashed. We live here on Earth consumed by social media and the attention economy. We stare at our phones and computers, actively engaging and feeding the beast.  We post images of ourselves and our private lives, hoping that other people like it, and that something good may happen, while simultaneously fearing that something bad may occur. Some of us leaders take action, and drive the narrative. Others wait in fear, hoping they get enough likes and followers to be relevant.\n\nBe a Lion. Not a Gazelle.\n\nThe Animal Kingdom is a music NFT by Jack Frost.  It is a digital collectible that has Metaverse and IRL community utility. Godspeed,  Anon.",
