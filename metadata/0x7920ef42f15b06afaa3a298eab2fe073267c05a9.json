    "description": "That, which surrounds me, fills me up.\nCalm winds and clear water;\nI look up, to breathe in what has been lent to me.  \nThen down, to let out everything I believed was my own.\n\n“A reflection of myself, or is it you?”\nI extend my hand, and he extends his;\nI call to him, and he calls back.\nA tear of joy, and I dive in —\n\nI dive in, and there is unity.\nI dive in, and there is serenity.\n\nAs I delve deeper,\nA maze presents itself —\nLeading back to where I started, \nLeading back to where I belong.\n\nDive.",
