    "description": "Mandatory Happiness: V. o3  \nCan you trust what you hear and see is real? \nWhen it comes to information that comes to us through our devices, how can we be sure we’re not being manipulated? The short answer is, we are, but how much? \nThese are the issues that I try to address with the Mandatory Happiness metaphor. The VR headset is the tool the cultural matrix uses to issue its message, but for most of us it’s a phone or computer. The happy symbol is the cultural matrix telling us to move along, be happy in your ignorance, nothing to see here or telling us to be angry about something or afraid, upset, or disgusted by other things. Are these ques always the correct response or are they the response that cultural matrix wants?  \nThe NFT & cryptocurrency ecosphere is countercultural by nature. In my mind it’s a direct response to the programmed life choices that the culture has set up for us all. Mandatory Happiness: V. o3 is a visual reminder to push back against the programming and think for yourself. \n",
