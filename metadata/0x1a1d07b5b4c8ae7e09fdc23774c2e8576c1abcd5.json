    "description": "A beautiful image of the original hand painted acrylic on canvas work by Elena Ab in her final year. Ab was exploring her work with gold leafing & her love for the iconic pop culture couple lead to this vibrant portrait of a man so many have come to adore throughout the years. Her choice of colors is continuous throughout all her pieces in the aspect that it makes the moment larger than life just as she was as an artist in her years here with us. ",
