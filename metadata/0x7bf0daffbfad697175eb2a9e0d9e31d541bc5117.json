    "description": "\"The Last of Them\" (TLoT) is a boutique charity-based NFT collection dedicated to saving unfortunately endangered and not so popular species on the Planet, by donating 80% of its profit to the charities. \n\nThe Amur Leopard is probably the rarest cat on Earth â€“ its fur spots are as unique as our human fingerprints. Amur Leopards occupy the Amur Heilong Landscape (both the Russian Far East and adjacent areas of China). Unfortunately, it is critically endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. Currently: only 80 left.",
