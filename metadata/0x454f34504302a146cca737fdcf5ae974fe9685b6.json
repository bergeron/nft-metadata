    "description": "Residents of Orangurock have arrived from all corners of the Metaverse… but those who control the vibe of this bustling Metacity aren’t exactly thrilled about new challenge to the power structure. As the fallout unfolds inside the metaverse crossroads of Orangurock, the tale is told with the help of the Myth Division, through the eyes of American Ape. If you hold this during the Jan 1, 2023 screenshot, you will be airdropped an Apartment KeyCard before our inaugural Orangurock Day Celebration inside The Sandbox Game. The KeyCard is your access to the Metacity, offering licensing opportunities, retail advertising space for your digital collectibles, a virtual store to display or sell your digital collectibles, and the opportunity to join the main storytelling lore as it unfolds in real-time. You will also be granted early access to our upcoming presence in The Otherside Metaverse experience."
