    "description": "NON FUNGIBLE MEDITATION #1\nSit with a straightened spine and gaze at this video. Cover your left nostril breathe in slowly from the right. Hold at capacity. Cover the right and breathe out the left all the way, then hold and switch. No force. No stress. Just relax and allow the prana to flow through you.\nBreathing is as important as drinking water, eating, or exercising. For the body, mind and spirit.  If you ever feel overwhelmed, get in touch with your breath until you reach a state of calm and understanding.",
