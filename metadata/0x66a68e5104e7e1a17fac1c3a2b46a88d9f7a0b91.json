    "description": "A person sitting on a bench outside his house looks at the clear sky and the apparent order of reality. However in their mind the order is lost and a bunch of different ideas, thoughts urges are always raising. The outside world, the thoughts and feelings all converge to the abstract colourful subconscious.\n\n​\n\n“Almost all of our mind is unconscious. We have to learn to communicate with that mysterious part of our mind. It has its own language, and symbols help us do that.”\n\nElsa Punset",
