    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n\"Summer\" is our 9th release this year, paying homage to the dance music legend Calvin Harris and his hit song that has soundtracked our summers for a decade. We thought it needed a true PM version. Deep melodic techno? Don’t mind if we do.\n\nNext single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.",
