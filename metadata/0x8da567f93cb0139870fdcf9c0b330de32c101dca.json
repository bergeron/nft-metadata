    "description": "DROP IN THE BUCKET\nWater | Education | Empowerment\n\nWeâ€™re working to eliminate poverty and water related illness on three fronts\n\nWATER & SANITATION\nIn addition to wells, we install flush latrines at schools, and provide materials to teach students about proper sanitation.\n\nThis information then spreads throughout the village, further reducing sanitation related illnesses and deaths.\n\nPROJECT SUSTAINABILITY\nAny development project is only life-changing if it stays working for a long period of time. With this in mind all of our work is designed with sustainability in mind.\n\nUnderstanding how and why projects fail key in solving sustainability issues.\n\nGENDER EQUALITY & EDUCATION\nWhile water and sanitation are undoubtedly important, education has always been the most important way to help people move themselves out of poverty\n\nWith this in mind Drop in the Bucket started an education program that provides secondary school scholarships to girls in South Sudan and Uganda.",
