    "description": "The ever evolving sense of being a part of the remotest of places, with the sound of Nature engulfing the senses and sending conscience into the abyss of darkness. A place which just a few hours ago seemed the epitome of serenity, is now filled with mystery and shadows, and yet it still becomes even more captivating than before.\n\nThe cold was intense but the weather forecast was promising, so a decision was made to stay at this off- the-beaten path spot, waiting for the dance of the Northern Lights. \n\nBeautiful pine trees are still an uncommon sight in Iceland, due to intense human deforestation centuries ago, but you can still find natural forest havens like these, which become even more captivating when adorned with the magic of the Aurora Borealis. \n\nSingle long exposure photo: 30 seconds exposure. \n\nCollector will get a higher resolution version and/or physical print upon request. \n\n10% profits donated to Give Back to Nature Reforestation Project.
