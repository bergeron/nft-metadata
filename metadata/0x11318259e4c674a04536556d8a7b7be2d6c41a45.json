    "description": "\"I understand that it's out of my control, but in the end, Pepe is whatever you say he is, and the creator, say that Pepe is love\". Matt Furie (2016). It is no secret what memes are native to WEB 3 and the oldest of all is Mr. Pepe. There has been a lot of controversial opinion over what Pepe really is or symbolizes since his appearance on NFTs in 2016 and beyond. Pepe the frog dates back to 2006 when it appeared in a Matt Furie comic called \"Boyâ€™s Club.\" Ever since, different renditions of Pepe have emerged. He was once used for politics, as hate symbol, and many outside the space. But here in the space Mr. Pepe has in one way brought us together as a community. Though, some may have different or contradictory opinion; I strongly believe that truly, Pepe is love.",
