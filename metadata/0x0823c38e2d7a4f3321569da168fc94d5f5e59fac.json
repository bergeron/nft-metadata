    "name": "Leviathan Silver Horn Spider",
    "description": "Gliese 581c, formally named Synchro and now establish its official name - Leviathan is a planet approximately 20 LY from Earth orbiting within the Gliese 581 system in the constellation of Libra. With a mass 5.5 times that of the Earth it is classified as a super-Earth. Due to its relatively close distance to Earth, Leviathan was one of the first super-earth planets to get colonized without the need to terraform its atmosphere.\n\nThe planet's massive mountain range and vast forests are home to an incredibly diverse and complex living ecosystem.\n\nThe Silver Horn Spider found its home in the high altitude mountain range and is an active hunter that chases and overpowers its prey with a well-developed sense of touch and sight, a muscular body, and a powerful horn-like spear-shaped head. \n\nPreserved within stone and glass, this specimen was one of the first know alien lifeforms brought back to Earth from the colonies.\n",
