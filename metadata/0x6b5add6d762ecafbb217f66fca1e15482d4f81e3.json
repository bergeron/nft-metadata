In the darkness, the fire burns even brighter.\nThis is a digital life of great work canvas oil 120 * 80cm.\nThe original of this work was exhibited at various exhibitions.\n2022 - Edition 1/1 GIF\nThere is such a children's song:\n\"Carousel, carousel begins the story.\nThese are fairy tales, songs and fun!\nCarousel, carousel is a joy for us,\nTake a ride on our carousel! \"\nAnd I painted my experience and the image (metaphor) of burning time and childhood.
