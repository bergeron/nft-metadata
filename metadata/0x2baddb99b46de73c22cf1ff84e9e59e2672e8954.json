    "description": "This image was taken during the lockdown of 2020, I was moored up in a small town in the south east of the UK.\nThe feeling of being trapped and constrained was quite profound, and so I started to look for interesting views and scenes in my local surroundings. \nA combination of night time and mist helps to create strange and unusual environment, even in a place I am very familiar with.
