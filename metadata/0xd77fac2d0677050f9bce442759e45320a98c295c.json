    "description": "My family and I were on holiday at a beach house, part of the fence line was overrun by a large clump of aloe vera. I was obsessed with it! It’s a beautifully structural plant and a large display like this is so striking. It was raining and windy the first few days we were there so we couldn’t go to the beach, while we sat looking out to the water, my eyes would keep looking to the aloe vera. When the weather cleared, the first thing I did was grab my camera to take a closer look. I sat by this plant and took my time to find my world.\nThe ocean was by my side that day. It was my companion, keeping me company while I explored. When I look at this image, I see the movement of the waves and hear the water hitting the shore - By My Side.\n",
