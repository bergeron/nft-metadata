    "description": "No matter how beautiful the earthly realms maybe today, time will take its toll in the most mysterious of ways, seeding in us the questions of permanence, setting us up for the quest of truth, the truth which tells us who makes up till the end, who stays, who leaves.\nIf forever even is a thing... if what we take pride in today will exist in all its glory till the end of the time. The answers to all of them make us humans feel like the tiniest part of the universe who has taken up a small fraction of space time, whose silly materialistic mind will make him think over and over again that the world will stay as it is today.\n\nJPEG, 3000 x 4000px\n",
