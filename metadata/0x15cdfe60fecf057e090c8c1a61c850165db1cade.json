    "description": "Pretty cool…pretty and cool…cosmopolitan or cosmos…yep, all those things. All the Friends love colour and a bit of anonymity but once you get to know them they are very friendly. It’s always summer and there’s always music where they are…and the glare of fame is bright so coloured sunglasses are always worn and how can one not have coloured hair? The background to life is always changing into many colours…and the kisses…oh so brilliant from all those coloured lips!",
