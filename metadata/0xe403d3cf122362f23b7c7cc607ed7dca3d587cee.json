    "description": "1640 Bored Ape Yacht Club by Jan Brueghel II\n\nThis painting makes fun of NFT degens and the Bored Apes of Bored Ape Yacht Club. \n\nIn the 21st century NFTs became an extraordinary craze across the world.\n\nA flourishing trade in NFTs developed. Prices rose to unheard-of levels and speculation was rife - especially on Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. \n\nThe result was huge profits and huge losses. \n\nHere, Bored Apes of the Bored Ape Yacht Club negotiate, weigh Bitcoin and Ether, count Bitcoin and Ether, and do administrative tasks. \n\nThe Bored Ape on the left has a list with the prices of NFTs. \n\nOn the right a Bored Ape urinates on Bitcoin and Ether. \n\nThe idea of this work being to poke fun at the NFT mania fuled by Bored Ape Yacht Club. \n\n(This work is based on a 1640 work by Jan Brueghel II entitled “Allegory on the Tulip Trade”).",
