    "description": "Sugarcane plant flourishes in tropical and subtropical climates. Brazil, India and China are at the top for the most annual sugarcane production globally. Sugarcane production is also vibrant in the USA, the Caribbean, regions of Africa and Asia. \n\nThe harvesting process involves lots of hard manual labour. Here a worker is seen in the scorching midday sun cutting sugarcane with a machete. They are arranged into piles, after which a mobile machine grabs the bundles and loads them into a trailer that brings them to the sugar mill for processing.\n\nLICENSE AGREEMENT ~\nPrimary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays, as long as the creator is credited.
