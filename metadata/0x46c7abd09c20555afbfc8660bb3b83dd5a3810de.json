    "description": "network mask, \n\nEmerging from the contours of the face is a network-like membrane, composed of intricate strands of a biosynthetic web. The membrane's delicate threads weave their way through the air, forming a web-like structure that extends outward. Symbolizing the pervasive reach of digital networks, which have become inextricably intertwined with our daily lives. At the same time, the membrane serves as a metaphorical barrier, a digital veil that can isolate individuals from genuine human connections and mask the authenticity of their real-world experiences.\n\nNetwork Mask: In computer networking, a network mask (also known as a subnet mask) is a string of numbers used to define the range of IP addresses within a particular subnet.",
