    "description": "Angels Order / First\n\"Angel of Crystals\"\n\nThe \"Last Judgment\", an all-out war between mankind and angels, ended in the defeat of mankind, which lost 95% of its population.\nAt that time, those who saw the wings of the angels stained with blood called them \"demons,\" and the story has been passed down to posterity as a fairy tale along with the horror it inspired.\nAfter the Great War, her power to rule the light became so strong that God and other angels, fearing her power, took away her wings and sealed her forever.\n\nFive thousand years have passed, and the record of the Last Judgment is now fading away.\nIt is a time of chaos when the power of the \"devil\" has materialized and attacked mankind.\nAt that time, a young man receives a revelation.\n\nHe was told to visit the heavenly realm to destroy the devil.\n\nThe chosen one receives a revelation from an \"angel\" and knocks on the gate to the heavenly realm to obtain the power to defeat the \"devil\".",
