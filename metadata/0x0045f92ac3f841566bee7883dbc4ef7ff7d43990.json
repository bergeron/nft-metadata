    "description": "As humans we tend to hold on to what we believe, whether it's our life values, relationships, biases...\nBut the truth is if you let go of that belief you don't know what will happen to you, good or bad, we like to avoid the unknown.\nas Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche said: “The bad news is you’re falling through the air, nothing to hang on to, no parachute. The good news is, there’s no ground.”\nThe moment you accept that, You will change your mind and you will go through changes that you could never think of.",
