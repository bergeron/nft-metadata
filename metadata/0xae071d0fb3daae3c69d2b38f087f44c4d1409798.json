Soldiers were given military training and then the control of the security of the areas was entrusted to these soldiers. From the 10th century AD, agricultural families who had financial power in different regions of Japan formed a group of soldiers skilled in archery and horse riding to protect the security of their territories. These soldiers, who were in the service of their master, were called samurai.\n\nThe first part of this series is about different warriors with their own stories\n",
