    "description": "The Spirit Of Adventure\n\nSet against the iconic skyline of Hong Kong, this image is one of the highlights of my photography career.\n\nBorn in the US state of Tennessee, Forrest Rain Oliveros dreamt of being a dancer from an early age. Upon leaving his home to pursue his dream in New York, Forrest was scouted by Hong Kong Ballet, moved to Hong Kong and became one of the city's top ballet dancers.\n\nOur paths crossed during the height of the pandemic when we both needed a creative escape, and this image was born.  As Forrest states \"We all have the ability to bring joy and happiness into other's lives. Be active in your pursuit to live selflessly.\"  We hope this photograph not only brings joy to anyone who sees or collects it, but we also hope it can inspire the dreamers to pursue their passions, whatever they may be.\n\nCollectors will receive a high resolution digital file, extended editorial rights & an airdrop of an upcoming edition.\n\nImage size: 4553 x 3238\nLocation: Hong Kong",
