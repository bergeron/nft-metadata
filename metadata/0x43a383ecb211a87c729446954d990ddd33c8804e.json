    "description": "The fourth collection of work from Modern Vintage Photos once again explores the gifts the universe has given us. \"Abandoned Beauty\" attempts to find beauty in entropy. In and around buildings and factories long ago abandoned, stories are told and remembered honoring the souls that once occupied those spaces.\n\nTogether with the creativity of the models, Modern Vintage Photos explores these wonderful spaces looking for their character. What might have happened in that corner, stairway, doorway? What story is it now trying to tell?\n\nIn these places we encounter new life using the shelter. We frequently meet dogs, cats, monkeys, monitor lizards, wasps, bees, ants and many more of Earth's creatures. We treat them with respect, as we should. We are guests in their home.\n\n\"Abandoned Beauty\" is a series of images that come to us through an openness the voices of the past. We can hardly take credit. Another gift from the universe.\n\nThanks and praises.",
