    "description": "When I was a little girl, my parents told me about the American dream. I believed every word of it. I claimed the idea that anyone could make it through unconventional thinking,hard work, creative ideas and hope. What I did not expect, were the big lies. The crumbling of our democracy prompted me to create this important piece. It is not just a piece about the USA and my disillusion, it is also a piece about the betrayal that resulted in a wrongful conviction, that cost 14 years of our lives. I revisited the poem from a few years ago, realizing much had not changed. I remain in the bubble of hope. It has to get better. This was then, and is still now, a story about not only my life but also the lives of so many others fighting for empathy.\n\nFreedom is liberty\nbut here is just irony.\nThey won't get the best of me,\nlife has just begun.\nSTOP\nTell me a new joke!\nJustice is fair, not broken!\nAll these words just spoken\nwithout tangibility.\n\n1/1\n1080x1350\nMP4",
