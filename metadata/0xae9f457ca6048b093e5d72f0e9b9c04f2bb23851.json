    "description": "Fantasy tavern management game with collectible furniture and adventurers! Genesis explorers meant as a token of gratitude for early supporters. These ancient warriors were blessed (or cursed) by the gods to somehow keep on going, even when they shouldn’t. Prophecies link their lives to the very fate of this world, and it’s whispered that only by the hands of their brothers they shall be put to rest.  Utility inside the game TBA",
