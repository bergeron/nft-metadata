    "description": "2,534 women were killed by men in the last 10 years in Turkey. We feel the violence against women everyday in every part of our lives as women, even in our personal social media. This collage is made from 100 women's photographs which they deleted or never posted because of cyber violence against women with their story of what they’ve been through due to one photograph. Story of women who are trying to protect themselves from any harassment possible… \n\nProfits generated will be donated to the We Will Stop Femicides Platform.
