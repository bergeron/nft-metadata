    "description": "GRLS DNT CRY started out as an instrumental I created live on my twitch stream this January, and later finished by added voice memos and calls from my phone. \n\nLately I've been feeling extra fatigue trying to navigate the music industry as a solo female artist, so I created this track as an expression of the frustration and exhaustion of trying to excel in a man's world. I constantly deal with this pressure to act and portray myself in certain ways that aren't authentic in order to be accepted or taken seriously, and it weighs on me daily. While I have lots of hope for Web3 to provide equal opportunities and space for all types of artists and personalties, I get discouraged when I see the same patterns of the past repeating themselves. \n\nLyrics:\nyou will never see me cry\nbut I'm living in a lie\n\n\nThe winner of the Golden Egg will receive a custom merch package, including a premium quality Dot Sweatshirt, Beanie, Logo Stickers, and signed vinyl: https://streamlabs.com/dotmvsic/merch\nThey can also choose between a 30-minute call on zoom, or open-lobby gaming session on Apex, Overwatch, or Fortnite :)",
