    "description": "A sleeping baby dear is a reminiscent of childhood, Disney movies and tenderness of being cared and loved. At the same time it reminds of what's lost for good. Fawn opens his eyes and knows, that childhood is about being ignorant. Sleeping in a keepsake helps to recover, but very soon it will be standing on its own legs, trying to brake through this hostile world.",
