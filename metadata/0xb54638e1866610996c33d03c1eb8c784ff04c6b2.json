    "description": "\"01, COLLEGAMENTI\" is my first computer drawing. I made it with Mac Draw in a Apple PowerBook 100 in 1994. I never sold it because there was no NFT back then, so how could I? Now it's a unique work that also appears in my Floating Studio. \nIt was exhibited at Andrea Nuovo Home Gallery in Naples for the first time at my Solo Show \"FloatingStudio/Collegamenti\" on March 2022, (a show curated by Massimo Sgroi).
