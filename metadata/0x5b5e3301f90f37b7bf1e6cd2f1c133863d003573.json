    "description": "Gavin The Sahara Giraffe Collection is a collection of 1/1 digital design by ATWCRYPTO. It depicts what ATWCRYPTO perceives a Sahara Giraffe... as a symbolism that is linked to the balance between the head and the heart which is considered as a spiritual messenger as well as being considered a gentle giant in the Sahara that looks like a sail boat gliding gently across the desert ocean... We hope that you will like every single piece in this collection as much as we enjoyed creating them for you. Thank you and God bless.\n",
