    "description": "In April I was fortunate enough to be living in an apartment that had a rooftop looking over SoHo. I couldn't resist taking pictures as the sun set over the city, producing some beautiful shots. \n\nThis one was taken while sat up there with friends, drinking beer and enjoying the evening. An insight into the rooftops above the chaos that is the city of New York.",
