    "description": "This healing journey is draining, but once the creative spirit is able to harness its power and transform trauma into self expression, the result is quite beautiful, raw, and revealing.  \n\nAcrylic Agony is the journey of my partner, Adi Spiegleman, processing trauma and using it as a vessel to create art. Through this journey, she graciously granted me access to document her experience over the course of an 8 hour night.  \n\nBecause everyone processes trauma on different timelines, I decided to create a dynamic NFT, in which you can view the full narrative of Adiâ€™s journey in 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 12 hours (double click the piece to change the time frame). Within these time frames, twelve photographs rotate across her finished painting, allowing you to watch her intimate and vulnerable creative process unfold.  \n\nI hope this piece can give comfort to those who are still healing and inspire others to find refuge in art as a way to explore their emotional wounds.",
