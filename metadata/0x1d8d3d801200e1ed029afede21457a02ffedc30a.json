    "name": "EARLY SPRING BIRD",
    "description": "You notice very quickly when it's spring again. The birds chirp much louder. In the morning there is still a fine damp dew. As if from nowhere the first flowers appear. The sun reflects in the moist air. Many little animals crawl out of their holes. A wonderful stage of nature. Spring is a wonderful gift every year.\n\nArtist: Kathrin Federer\nCreated 2021 in Photoshop\n3030 x 3787 px | 300 dpi\nEdition 1/1\n\nValid Copyright and License: CC-ND-SA \nThe first collector receives the original JPG and TIFF  on request.",
