    "name": "Tree of Life",
    "description": "The tree of life \nis a fundamental archetype in many of the world's mythological, religious, and philosophical traditions. It is closely related to the concept of the sacred tree. The concept of the tree of life may have originated in Central Asia, and absorbed by other cultures, such Scandinavian mythology and Altai shamanism.\n\nThe tree of knowledge, connecting to heaven and the underworld, and the tree of life, connecting all forms of creation, are both forms of the world tree or cosmic tree, and are portrayed in various religions and philosophies as the same tree. Trees promote health and social well-being by removing air pollution, reducing stress, encouraging physical activities, and promoting social ties and community.",
