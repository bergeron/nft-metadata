    "name": "Midnight in Tokyo",
    "description": "Walking the streets of Tokyo at midnight. Alone with my thoughts. An intimate date with the city I love.\n\nI walked these empty streets. Along my travels I stop to replenish. These late hours call for coffee. An unending task to explore this vast city.\n\nThe more I observe the fragments of this city, the more I come to love them. I may be finding my foothold I need to go on living.\n\nï¼ŠI took this photo on a medium-format film camera using Kodak Professional Film in February 2022.",
