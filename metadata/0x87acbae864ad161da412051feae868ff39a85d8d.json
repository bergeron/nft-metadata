    "description": "The world was once a vast and beautiful place. But now, it was nothing more than a book. A book that was slowly being destroyed by the hands of time. The pages were yellowing and the ink was fading. The binding was weak and the cover was falling apart.\n\n\nBut despite all of this, the book was still cherished by those who knew of its existence. They would gather around it and take turns reading from its pages. They would laugh and cry and feel all the emotions that the world had to offer.\n\n\nAnd even though the book was falling apart, they knew that as long as they had it, the world would never truly be gone.",
