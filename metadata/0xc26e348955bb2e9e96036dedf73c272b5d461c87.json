    "description": "The artwork looks at visually interpreting the Nava Nidhis (nine divine treasures) of Kubera- the God of Wealth. Each Nidhi is associated with a guardian Spirit. The Nidhis are largely unexplained and remain unknown. Except for its mention in Hanuman Chalisa verse 31. Which reads \nAshta siddhi nava nidhi ke dātā, asa bara dīnha jānakī mātā\n(Mother Sita granted you a boon to become the bestower of 8 Siddhis (supernatural powers) and 9 Nidhis (divine treasures))\nWhen materialized, these are symbols that are interpreted as\nMahapadma(great lotus flower), Padma(lotus flower), Shankha(Conch), Makara(Crocodile), Kachchhapa(Tortoise), Kumud(precious stone), Kunda(Jasmine flower), Neel(Sapphire), Kharva(fire cups)\nThe graphic places Hanuman with the nine Nidhis granted by Mother Sita circling around itself to provide a strong visual narrative of the verse in Hanuman Chalisa and tries to provide an insight into the idea of Nava Nidhi.",
