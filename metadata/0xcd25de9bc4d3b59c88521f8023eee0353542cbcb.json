    "description": "A tribute to Nicola Tesla (1856 - 1943)\n\nThe World Wireless System was a system designed by inventor Nikola Tesla based on his theories of using Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for \"the transmission of electric energy without wires\" on a global scale, as well as point-to-point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting. \nThe project was abandoned in 1906 due to lack of funds, never to become operational.\n\nTechnique: Machine hallucination created with guided generative adversarial networks, additional AI-driven pattern-recognition animations.\n\nFormat: mp4 video loop\n\nDimensions: 2160 × 2160 px\n\n",
