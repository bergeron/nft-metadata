    "description": "The wandering nomad.\n\nIf you are reading this, it means that i am already dead.\n\nYear 3050. Humans have ceased to exist and aliens have taken over the planet. Earth has become 20x polluted. Their are only one million of humans population left in which half of them have been mutated to either join the alien army and the rest of them including me, has escaped to another planet named fravis x. \n\nWe don't know what is going to happen to us, where we are gonna live, we just wander like nomads least bothered about our situations because Hope had died in our minds along time ago. \n\nsee you on the other side.",
