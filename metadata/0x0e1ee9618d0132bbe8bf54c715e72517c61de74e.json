    "description": "Peace! You can call me Jack, and I’m an artist from the DMV. My creative style embraces all mediums for the sake of passionate storytelling, transformation, and awakening. Just as I have been finding my way within this world creatively, I can’t help but notice a sense of being found: the absorption into something bigger, more expansive, and often beyond words.\n\nWAYSPACE is the name I’ve given to this bigger dimension of awareness that lies within us, both collectively and individually. It also happens to be the name of my debut album, which was released on Halloween 2022.\n\nThis new song, Saw, serves as a prequel to the album. It represents the mess, the breakdown, the disappointment, and the suffering aroused by loss, grief and nostalgia. Saw also reveals a quiet willingness to see the beauty in every difficulty. When we hear the words “Could it be that we’re just on the scenic route? Seeing tears on everybody coming down” we are offered a chance to embrace the suffering and understand that it connects us through compassion.\n\nThis was one of the first songs that my closest collaborator, Fabrizio, and I ever made together. Fabrizio is also the main producer on the album, so it means a lot to be able to share a song that is so dear to both of us. I’m grateful that it now has a home right here.",
