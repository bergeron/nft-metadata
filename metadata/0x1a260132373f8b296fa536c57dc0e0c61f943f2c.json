    "description": "The world is ending. Your world is ending but there are two comforting facts despite this cruel reality. The first is that it's only one world, the second is that this has happened before and will happen again. Among this one broken world are vast array of new worlds, other possibilities that are now ripe for the picking. With the end of this world approaching, a newfound freedom to be reborn has presented itself. Furthermore it has even been claimed; standing adorned in blood and bones while surrounded by crows a new being has been born amidst the chaos. Who is this being though? Who's remains are they wearing? Why did the world have to end? Currently this is the last chapter in our new being's journey to becoming what they are, but how did we get this far? The only way to find out is to trace this story back to its beginning, the story of Another Rebirth.",
