    "description": "Los Angeles-based artist and producer Aly wears his heart on his sleeve with “SING ALOUD.” Offering his unique perspective as a first-generation American whose parents immigrated from India and Pakistan, “SING ALOUD” explores Aly’s headspace as he battles the tension between family expectation and the choice to pursue his passion for music. \n  \nA vulnerable rumination detailing Aly’s inner dialogue between him and his father, “SING ALOUD” serves as a self-soothing lullaby to process difficult emotions while deftly manipulated vocals and a swaggy laid back r&b beat produced by Supah Mario (Drake, Young Thug, Lil Uzi Vert) create a sonic reflection of Aly’s ability to create beauty from a place of pain. \n\n----\n\nThis is the seventh track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
