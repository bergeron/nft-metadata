    "description": "I have shot this image in Palkhi festival or Warakari festival in Maharashtra state of India near Pandharapur. Palkhi festival showcases the distinctive feature of the Maharashtrian culture. This is a 1000-year-old tradition, which has been following by the warkaris (people who follow the wari, a fundamental ritual). People perform collective singing, dancing, chanting to the holy town of Pandharpur barefoot in Hindu months June-July and November-December. I was very lucky to get this shot to freeze their enthusiasm. This image won many awards for me including NATGEO India Culture Category Award and published in many national and international magazines and exhibited in 20 plus countries.\n\nLocation: Pandharpur, India\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 5993 X 4000\nCamera: Nikon D750\nShot in Year: 2018\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n",
