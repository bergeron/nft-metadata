    "name": "The Protector 2",
    "description": "After passing the test of The Protector and receiving the Shinobi stone, the Wizard set his sights on the tall rock mountain that was said to hold the Ether Stone.\n\nAs he made his way up the mountain, he encountered many challenges. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he reached the top of the mountain. There, he found the Ether Stone, shining brightly in the sunlight. The wizard reached out and took the stone, feeling its power coursing through his veins. \n\nNow, with both the Shinobi and Ether Stones in his possession, the wizard was now unstoppable. He continued on his quest for power and acquiring even more powerful magical artifacts.",
