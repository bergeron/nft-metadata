    "description": "Kwade's debut NFT collection exemplifies the artist’s continued investigation into the self, which culminated in her recent exhibition \"In Abwesenheit\" (In Absence) at Berlinische Galerie, Berlin, Germany. For this show, the artist printed her entire genome on 259.025 A4 sheets of paper. Whilst 99,9% of all human DNA is identical, Kwade highlighted her individual and unique profile in bold text. With approximately 12,000 sheets hung floor-to-ceiling and the remainder being placed in copper containers, the artist invited the public to take a piece of her home.   \n\nAlicja Kwade says: \"Starting with the exhibition at Berlinische Galerie, I wished to globally spread my DNA in virtual form, whereby using blockchain technology seemed a logical progression.”   \n\nEvery piece in Alicja Kwade - Selbstportrait, 2020 is a unique digital work, randomised at point of sale. Minted onto 25 pages, it each consists of approximately 300,000 letters of Kwade’s DNA, an amount that corresponds with the size of many human genes. In addition to receiving the digital file, a PDF can be downloaded from the Verisart certificate, allowing the buyer to print each individual A4-sheet. Accordingly, Kwade’s Selbstportrait, 2020 explores the boundaries between digital NFT and physical artwork.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/01935137-0d24-4a96-a617-64b132811e90",
