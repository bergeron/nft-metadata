    "description": "A scarecrow stood in a field one day,\nStuffed with straw,\nStuffed with hay;\nHe watched the folk on the king's highway,\nBut never a word said he.\n\nMuch he saw, but naught did heed,\nKnowing not night,\nKnowing not day,\nFor, having nought, did nothing need,\nAnd never a word said he.\n\nRagged man, I loved him well,\nStuffed with straw,\nStuffed with hay,\nMany's the tale that he could tell,\nBut never a word says he.",
