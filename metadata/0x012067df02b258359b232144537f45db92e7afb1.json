    "description": "SAGEALINA is a singer/songwriter located in Los Angeles, CA and originally from Cape Cod Massachusetts. Pop-queen, Latina flare or the dark black sheep - she embodies all of these layers through her music. SAGEALINA will be giving her fans a preview of where she is taking her career by dropping NFTs of unreleased records that unlock exclusive experiences and behind the scenes content.\n \nThis music NFT - \"ENEMIES\" is a song that represents the ongoing abuse and suffering that women endure all over the world. The lyrics from the song were inspired from a dream SAGEALINA had, and chose to process by making music. “ENEMIES” will be a single off her debut album “PAIN OF A WOMAN” coming next year, which her NFT holders will get to access first. SAGEALINA is now determined to spread awareness and advocacy towards some of the biggest issues we face in the world by using her platform.\n",
