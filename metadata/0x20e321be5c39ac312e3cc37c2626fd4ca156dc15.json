    "description": "One of the most amazing spiral staircases I've ever seen. Found by chance in Frankfurt while there shooting the amazing architecture of the city.  \nWalked through a door left open to a building and was greeted by this beautiful twisting, smooth spiral staircase. Standing under it looking up there were so many beautiful compositions to be had.  \nThe light was strong on one side and the other half covered in shadows, it gives this nice contrast to the spiral and some stunning definition and depth.  \nA joy to shoot and edit.",
