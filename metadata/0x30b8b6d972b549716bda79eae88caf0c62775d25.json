    "description": "Flower Power is a collection of artworks based on the theme of receiving the energy of the earth through flowers. We are healed by flowers that have grown large and nourished by the energy of the earth.\n\nI try to visualize to make an image of melting flower power healing into our body.\n So I often put roots into my works that are connected to the earth.\n\nWe spend our days with the energy of the earth in our bodies through flowers.\nWe are always grateful for the flowers and we always remember to be grateful for our daily life.\n\nFormat : 1920/1080 video, 00:24",
