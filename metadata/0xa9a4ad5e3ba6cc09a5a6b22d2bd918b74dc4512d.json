    "description": "55 edition pieces by Saphera (Saf) Peters to commemorate NFT NYC 2022, while paying homage to women taking over the Web3 space.  \n____\n\nHello! If you're reading this, chances are that you've scanned my sticker for a free NFT somewhere on the streets/events of NFT NYC. We may not have gotten to meet in person, but nice to virtually meet you (kinda). My name is Saphera (Saf) Peters and I'm a 1/1 artist from Toronto. \n\nNot only is this free NFT a cool way to commemorate your time at NFT NYC 2022, but this illustration titled, \"On Top\", symbolizes women taking over the Web3 space. As we move to mass adoption, it's important we continue to onboard and empower women in Web3 to make sure we/they don't get left behind this time, but instead, come up on top. \n\nHope you love your new NFT and welcome to the fam! I'm excited to connect further with you, friend. Don't forget to let me know you are 1 of 55 owners of this NFT on Twitter (@sapherapeters) <3.\n\nWith love,  \nSaf  \nhttps://twitter.com/sapherapeters",
