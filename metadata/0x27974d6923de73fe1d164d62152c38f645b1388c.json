    "description": "This is a photo of a male peacock spider (Maratus clupeatus). Peacock spiders are a type of jumping spider found here in Australia. They are about the size of a grain of rice. During spring, the males try to attract the females by performing a mating dance. They wave their long legs in the air, and fan out their abdomen to show off their bright colours and patterns.\n\nI spent about 3 months scouting locations and observing these awesome little creatures before I finally managed to capture this moment. It was all worth it. And it was pretty incredible to watch this play out.\n\nThere were actually 2 males trying to get the same female's attention. Every so often the second male would enter the area, and a quick fire brawl would erupt. For a second or two, they'd jump around all over the place, bouncing around like pinballs. Like something out of dragon ball z. Then one of the males would retreat, leaving the other male to try another dance.",
