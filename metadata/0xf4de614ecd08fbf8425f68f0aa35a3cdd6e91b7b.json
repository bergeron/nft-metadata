    "description": "Dusty Bones was the first song I wrote in Los Angeles after the death of my dear friend & mentor Hefe. The award winning director Peter Kagan took a shine to the song and conceived & shot this artful video. I've been a band leader since a young age, and a composer for films & art for about 15 years. Over the past couple years I've seen the potential for web3 tech to liberate artistry and community structures, both of which I’m all about. Dusty Bones is my “genesis” music video NFT, the first of many to come.  Music video by Peter Kagan. Edited by Steve Armstrong. Starring Lily Desmond, Michelle Hodnett, Matthew Brundrett, Alexander Burke & Joel Martin  Dusty Bones is taken from \"Universal Outsider\", release date May 20, 2022. www.matthewliamnicholson.com",
