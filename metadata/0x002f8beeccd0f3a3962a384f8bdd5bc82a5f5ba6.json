    "description": "The first couple is composed by a man with a dagger and a man riding a horse. I used the Red, the color of the blood, to enhance the dagger, the tool used to cause death, and I reported it also on the arms of a hypothetical soldier riding a horse, to underline that, a horse might be a “war tool”, but the real causes of wars are still our arms.",
