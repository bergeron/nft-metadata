    "description": "In the distant skies of red,  \nA planet beckons to be tread,  \nIts rusted surface a mystery,  \nBut humanity's curiosity makes history.\n\nWe send our starships and rovers,  \nTo learn about the world that hovers,  \nIn our Solar System, so far away,  \nPerhaps a new home some day.\n\nThe journey is long and tough,  \nBut the hope of discovery will be enough,  \nTo push us past the limits of our minds,  \nAnd the vast expanse of space to find.\n\nWe dream of inhabiting its land,  \nA new frontier oh so grand,  \nHumanity's never-ending quest,  \nFor exploration and progress.\n\nWe'll build our homes and grow our food,  \nIn this barren, alien neighborhood,  \nWe'll create a new civilization,  \nA beacon of our greatest imagination.\n\nFor we are explorers, adventurers at heart,  \nAnd the stars are our canvas, our art,  \nSo let us journey to Mars and beyond,  \nAnd create a future in the Cosmic Pond.",
