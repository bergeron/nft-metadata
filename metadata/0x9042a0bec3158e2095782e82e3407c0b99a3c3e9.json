    "description": "Reflecting on safety technologies and “technological overprotection”, we got interested in the myth of Icarus as a story about safety violations. The father made a life-saving machine and gave it with instructions to his son. The son violated them and died. The Icarus 2.0 would be protected from the loss of self-control and results from the enravishment of freedom ...\n... So, we want to make these wings to get the chance to study elusive states of flowing of control from the man to the machine and back. We want to feel by our body the limits where technological increase of the degrees of his freedom leads to the transfer of control to the machine. And is it possible to separate increase of abilities from increase of control? To separate freedom from control? ",
