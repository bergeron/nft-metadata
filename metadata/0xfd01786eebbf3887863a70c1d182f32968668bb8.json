    "description": "Just as the individual memories we gather throughout our lives come together to form our history, the pieces that compose Oceanview represent those non-linear, diffuse thoughts that appear in my mind as I gaze into the distance. Indifferent to what is immediately before my eyes, colors stretch while shapes collapse into each other. \n\nA reality unencumbered by time and space appears before me; watching over my little sisters in the park, summers in the backyard with family and friends, feeling the mist of crashing waves cooling my skin as tea warms my lips, wondering curiously about the dreams pulling out to sea at sunset, perched on the edge of the cliff looking out to the water. The creative techniques employed to create Oceanview brought old and new together, like the varied emotions that compose my history, one feeling at a time. \n\n\n\nExperimental Photography\nGum bichromate & Cyanotype\n48 x 34.5 cm\n\nAvailable to first collector for a limited time.\n\n*All rights reserved by the artist",
