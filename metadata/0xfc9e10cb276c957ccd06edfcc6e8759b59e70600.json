    "description": "Freedom is not cheap. \n\nThis past year has been about putting a price on my art, a price on what I am worth.\n\nArt is the utility and I am my art. How do I price such an intimate extension of myself? 69ETH? .00069eth? \n\nThat which is given freely and with no expectation of anything in return is pure. My intentions are pure in web3. My goals are to create art from my heart, and help other artists find a path toward financial freedom via their art.\n\nThe life of an artist is freedom. But that freedom comes at a cost.\n\nI will never be fully accepted and understood. I will never fit neatly into a box.  \nI will never settle into the lifestyle society expects from me.  \nI will never be the artist that you can predict what I will do next. I will not live a mediocre life.",
