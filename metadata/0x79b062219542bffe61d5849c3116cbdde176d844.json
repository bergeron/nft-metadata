    "description": "1/1 NFT\nfrom the painting \"Incantation-2\", 2022, acrylic on canvas, 116 X 89 cm ( 45,7 X 35 inch)\nArtist : Olivier Alibert\n\nOn the abstract backgrounds of my colorful paintings stand out forms that freely draw their inspiration from eclectic sources: nature, sculpture, ceramics, art history, archaeology, abstraction, ...\nMy paintings are marked by an importance of the void between the associated elements, a taste for hybridization and mystery, a search for intensity and expressiveness.\nEach painting then creates an imaginary space for the viewer.\nThis work also finds extensions in series of drawings.\n",
