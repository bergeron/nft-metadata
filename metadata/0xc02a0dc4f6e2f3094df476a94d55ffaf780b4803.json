    "description": "This painting illustrates the shapes of people who I think everyone meets at some point in their lives. Some gossiping as you see on the left bottom corner and some hysterically laughing but not understanding the joke entirely. Some not trusting and half way unsure if they would be able to trust anyone ever again. People lying behind our backs, cheating and breaking our hearts.. The people that we care about.",
