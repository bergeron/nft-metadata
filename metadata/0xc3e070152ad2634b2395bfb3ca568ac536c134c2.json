    "description": "It was our last set, in my apartment, where the sun was starting to rise high. Dazzled, I closed the curtain to protect her from the sun. Like a cat, she lay down on this sofa, in the hollows of the light, looking at me with a slightly teasing look.  \n\nThe \"Suspended Moments\" are those fractions of seconds, where time has lengthened between her and me. Moments that have become timeless in my memory.  \nEven after years, a simple look at this portrait reminds me of all those moments spent with her, her dance steps, our laughter, and the light that rested on her.",
