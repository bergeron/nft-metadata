    "description": "Art appropriation\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club  \nRight Click & Save  \nKeep Your Crypto\n\nLate last year (2022), Sotheby’s Metaverse, a high-end NFT-exclusive marketplace, sold Bored Ape #8817 for $3.41 million, or 819 ETH. Less than one percent (only 46 out of 10,000) of all Bored Apes have gold fur.\n\nBored Ape #8817 is a seven-trait gold-plated fur ape that comes in at #17, with a n overall rarity score of 297.37\n\nNFT investor “rhincodon,” who bought #8817, explained why he was so willing to pay such a price. “I had been seeking a gold ape for the previous few weeks, there isn’t a lot for sale, and those posted are generally sold for a cost of 1,000 ETH or more.”\n\nThis piece calls into question rights of ownership and transfer of digital assets, as well as the definition of what constitutes art and ownership.",
