    "description": "Women dance exuberantly during a wedding celebration ritual in Botswana. They are wearing traditional blue skirts and head scarves made from Leteitse, a traditional fabric made of a starched type of patterned cloth. During such celebrations, women also put a shawl (Mogagolwane or Tjale) on their shoulders indicating that they are older and married. The leteitse has become the ultimate fabric for traditional attire among Batswana and is a must-have for every woman. \n\nAt a Batswana wedding, culture is celebrated and the music is happy, infectious, and full of feeling.",
