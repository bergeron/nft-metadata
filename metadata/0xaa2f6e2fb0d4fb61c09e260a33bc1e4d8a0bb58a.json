    "description": "In each of us there are enough impressions that are united by something.\nIn my case, the garden became such a connecting phenomenon. This is a real place next to the house where I lived as a child.\nA number of memories are associated with it. Directly or indirectly. Basically, these are certain sensations that I can express through the image of objects and their interactions.\nFor me, the same important place as the physical space is the space of the psyche.\nIn this area, memories and feelings can combine into bizarre figures, forming logical and compositional connections that differ from the logic of the physical world we are used to.\nNevertheless, the world of the psyche is also real and precise in its manifestations.\nThe style inherent in this area has always attracted me and inspired me.\n\nMy series is a walk into the world of associations, fragments of memory and experience.",
