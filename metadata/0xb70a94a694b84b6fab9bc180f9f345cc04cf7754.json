    "description": "Minting live on https://amnesty-hurra.com\n\nAmnesty HURRA NFT is the first collection of Amnesty International. \nWith that collection, Amnesty International embraces Web 3.0 and its possibilities at the service of an important cause: defending rights to abortion around the world. \nThe funds raised will directly contribute to Amnesty Internationalâ€™s work in defending fundamental rights, the right to access safe and legal abortion, advocating for policy changes, and supporting grassroots initiatives that protect reproductive rights globally.\nThis represents a visionary leap for all NGOs. We aim to set an example for other organisations, showcasing the immense potential to leverage decentralised technologies to achieve impact. \nThrough this Amnesty HURRA NFT collection, we forge a path for NGOs to explore new fundraising avenues, engage with supporters in novel ways, and amplify the impact of their advocacy efforts.",
