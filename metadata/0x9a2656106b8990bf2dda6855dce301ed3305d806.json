    "description": "We were driving around looking for something to photograph when this big bull emerged out of the bushes. He didnâ€™t seem to feel threatened or uncomfortable because of us and came very close to the car, just feeding on the tasty bushes. This gave me the perfect opportunity to frame this photo. An interesting fact about elephants is that they eat between 150 and 170 kg on a daily basis which means they are spending around 80% of their day feeding. Their diet consists of bushes, small plants, fruits, and roots. Personally, elephants are among my favorite animals as they are beautiful to watch and very photogenic.",
