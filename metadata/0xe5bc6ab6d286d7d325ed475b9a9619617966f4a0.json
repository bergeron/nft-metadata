    "description": "During the pandemic, lottery at Singapore Pools became an alternate leisure activity on Sundays for some domestic helpers. This 1/1 NFT is a representation of a physical gown made of 4D betting slips collected from the migrant worker community. The top is made of validated winning tickets; the bottom, of losing ones. Each ticket is attached onto the dress by hand. \n\nThe gown is designed by Rini and Fya, who have been working in Singapore as domestic helpers since 2009. Rini enjoys collecting second-hand bridal gowns and organising fashion shows for the Indonesian migrant worker community. Fya is an aspiring model who's always game to experiment with different styles for the camera. \n\nThe NFT is brought to life by: Boldbase (3D visual design) & Cheng Lijie (sound design). \n\n(For our first collector, this NFT comes with the original physical gown.)\n\nHigh Resolution Video: https://tinyurl.com/4everdream\n",
