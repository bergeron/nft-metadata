    "description": "it was one of those days where nothing worked. \n\ntechnology was flickering, my car got a flat that broke the rim, the tire place didn’t have my shit… one of those days.\n\nI arrive at my session at pink slip’s 4 hours late happy that everyone waited around and was still inspired to create. from that day came crying in sunshine. I love blues music.  obviously love hip hop as well. I love a lot of things. \n\nI really like when a record feels honest and depicts a moment, though.",
