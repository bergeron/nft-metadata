    "description": "Over wood, I was pasting different materials, natural oxides and pigments, mixing some of them with acrylic to give it more color. Although first sights won't be seen, there is face with basic eyes and melancholic expression, caused by his addictions, to life and to alcohol, both incompatible one to another. This painting was made during first lock out due to COVID in 2020. Made by hand and made by me, H. Magnus",
