    "description": "I'm sure you would want to know the reason for the separation in this piece. The detachment of the head from its body is to open your eyes to see the strength they possess individually. However, none of the pieces can be complete without the other\n\nThe strength and power of each are well known to them and when put together, it becomes easy to achieve a collective purpose\n\nThe head has the ears, brain, eyes, nose, and mouth - but for it to function and use what it has effectively, it needed the body that's going to do the work\n\nThe body, on the other hand, has the legs for movement, and the hand to move things, but it doesn't have the brain to think, and doesn't have the eyes to see what is ahead. It needs the help of the head\n\n\" In separation, people tend to see what they are missing \" and what could have been achieved if they worked together.\n\nIn the real-life scenario, it painted a picture in our heads that despite our strengths, there's still a need to collaborate",
