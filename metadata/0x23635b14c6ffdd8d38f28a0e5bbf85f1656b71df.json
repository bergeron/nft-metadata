    "description": "Tides represent a renewal of energy. High Tide is indicative of exactly that for this moment in my career as an artist and even more so as an early participant in web3. \n\nHigh Tide exists as a stream of consciousness reflecting on my journey this far in web3; things I've observed, people I love, and things I simply don't like.\n\nThe record was recorded at Ocean View Beach Park in Norfolk, VA.",
