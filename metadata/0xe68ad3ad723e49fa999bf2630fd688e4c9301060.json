    "description": "“Petal Sculptures” is a series of miniature abstract sculptures constructed from flower petals. The deconstruction and reconstruction of a natural object as iconic in both art and nature as a flower set the stage for the creation of sculptures that are both beautiful and botanical. This combination allures and tricks viewers into admiring the object as something real, giving life to uncanny sculptures of a seemingly new species.",
