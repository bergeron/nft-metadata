    "description": "I have always considered photography as a healing process, it lets you stop and take in the moment, and capture the moment that you can relive forever and ever. This photo in San Juan Island during the Fall of 2022 with the fire leaves and a church behind it just made me stop and pause and realize that photography is my spiritual healing. It's my church",
