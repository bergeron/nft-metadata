    "description": "I love my kids. They know that, right? I like my job and feel fulfilled but the work I do. Does it make me a mad mom that I don’t hate the job that takes me from my kids? I work from home but don’t act like a “house wife” or “stay-at-home” mom during working hours. I focus on my workload and career goals. I sign-off work and sometimes still think about work things while I’m getting dinner ready. I spend time with my kids, I love them. I also care about my career. Haunted by these thoughts every day.
