    "description": "My first film NFT, from an evening that reignited the fire in my soul, listed on my one year NFT-anniversary.\n\nI spent this particular summer evening in Washington running around a meadow, gazing around in awe at the seemingly endless beauty. Making sure to stop and admire the scenery in between my camera clicks. As soon as I saw these few pines out in the distance, I knew I had to get a composition of them perfectly framing the peak. \n\nAs the sun started to go down, I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I hadn't felt this fulfilled and excited in a long time. My heart was full and I had the biggest smile on my face as I headed back to camp.\n\nTaken on Portra 400 in Washington // 2022",
