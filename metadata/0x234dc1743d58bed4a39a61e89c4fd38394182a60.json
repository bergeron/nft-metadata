    "description": "Keep it Together is my first duet, sung/written by me x Jean Castel & produced by Nasaya, Dean Woodson, and Jean. This song was born in Paris and completed in LA.\n\nOften times we try really hard to figure out why a relationship isn't working out but the reality is that no matter how much we want answers, sometimes we just won't get them. The hook, \"I don't know why but we just can't keep it together,\" captures that feeling very simply. This light, feel good, \"drive down PCH\" esque song will make you wanna dance and cry and everything in between. Keep it together is about accepting what is and surrendering to the moment. ",
