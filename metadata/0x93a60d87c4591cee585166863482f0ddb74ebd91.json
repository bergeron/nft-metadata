It was a place of great beauty and mystery, The island has three magical portals for three worlds, and each portal has a guarded soul that protects the GOX; whoever obtains the GOX will live an immortal life. But no one can approach the GOX  first without bathing in the island's wonder fall. \n\nThe entire island is submerged beneath the SnowX sea, which is patrolled by the medusa five-headed snake. and many people traveled there in hopes of finding the secret to eternal life. However, no one ever returned from the island. It was as if it disappeared into thin air. Some say that the island was just a myth, but others believe that it’s still out there with the eternity keeper.\n\nThe magic capsule got exposed, we need a loyal soul to protect this immortal island. By minting this you accept the eternity keeper role.",
