    "description": "For more than 15 years I have been exploring remote villages and settlements in my country. Surprisingly, so many places have remained almost the same as in the past. Sometimes, it seems that time has simply frozen there. And in my photographs, I try to preserve a piece of the past in our fast-paced and changing world. My goal is to show the beauty and uniqueness of places that many have forgotten about. In this photo, the small village Dunilovo. \n\nIn the 19th century, industry and trade flourished here, ships sailed along the river. Now only memories remain. And most of the merchant houses in the village are closed or abandoned.",
