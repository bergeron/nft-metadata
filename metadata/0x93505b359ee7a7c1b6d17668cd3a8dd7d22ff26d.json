    "description": "People spend a lot of time in a day on social media. We share our feelings, thoughts, ideas, successes or problems with the “Friends” and Followers who we may not even know. We are incapable of realizing to whom we are giving access to our personal information, how they can create our characteristic profile, study our behavior, and influence our choices in different ways. We become the product of systems dictating us how beauty looks like, what is happiness and the ideal world.\n\nExhibition History:\nContemporary Art Space, Batumi, 2021.\n\nUtility:\nNFT (1/1 edition) Includes A2 size .pdf print file (1/10 editions).",
