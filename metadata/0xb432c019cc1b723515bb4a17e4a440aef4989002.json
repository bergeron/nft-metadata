    "description": "I am Bonez, the ruler of the kingdom of Erebus. Gravedigger, taxidermist, and necrophiliac, I am the master of decay and the embodiment of death. The industry of decay is my kingdom, and cemeteries are my solace. I thrive in the darkness, preying on the living and the dead alike. I am a nightmare merchant, selling fear and horror to those who cross my path. And I am immortal, for even the hated cannot die in my presence. So beware, all who dare to enter my kingdom. I am Bonez, and I will claim your soul if you defy me.",
