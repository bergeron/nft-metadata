    "description": "It's funny how when someone leaves, their memories are all we have. 'postcards from [redacted]' is a collection of memories I have left from people who have come and gone. \n\nAn ode to picking flowers from the supermarket in NYC, planning to travel together to Netherlands, exploring Florence and Madrid all by myself, feeling stuck at home in India, words that I couldn't say until it was too late in London, and finding myself all over again in Koh Samui.\n\nThis is a highly mixed media artwork, some of the techniques/tools used here are Figma, Procreate, physical magazine and waste paper cutouts, among other processes. Different sections of this work were remainders of pieces that went into my SuperRare genesis piece so I thought of recycling those remnants with a little scrapbooking and new touches. Ultimately I wanted to release a work that is accessible and maybe even relatable. \n\nArt for the heart. From mine, to yours.",
