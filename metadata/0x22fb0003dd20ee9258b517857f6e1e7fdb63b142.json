    "name": "Paris in love",
    "description": "Paris has always been the city of love par excellence.\nCreating this picture was to me just as painting a painting: before even leaving my city to go to Paris, I had already analysed which angle could have been the best to shoot at, the best timing that would have given me the best lighting and the final cut. This picture has been imagined very long before being taken and, as a painter drawing the thoughts wandering through their mind, i felt proud of creating one of my best pieces",
