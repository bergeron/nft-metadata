    "description": "Lions look so majestic with their huge manes.\n\nThey're known as \"King of the Jungle,\" however they are actually found in the grasslands and plains...not the jungle.  Lions have the loudest roar of any big cat species and can be heard from up to 5 miles away.\n\nI feel this image shows the calm and peaceful side, to such a strong, powerful animal.\n\nYEAR: 2019 || DIMENSIONS: 2000*2000px\nEDITION: NFT 1/1\n",
