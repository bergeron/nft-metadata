    "description": "No one knew who Max was before the island, but everyone knows who he is now. He was the first to hear that the humans were going �TO THE MOON '' and didn't want to be left behind. So he MAY HAVE (allegedly) sent out a tweet, reddit post, and discord message that all went viral, which then resulted in 5,555 hamsters sneaking onto a space shuttle that later crashed in the middle of the ocean (...ON EARTH) and now they�re all stuck on this remote island. He�s a fast thinker and always trusts his lucky leaf (that he always has on him in his jacket), which he�ll need to be the hero that brings all the hamsters together and gets them off the island.",
