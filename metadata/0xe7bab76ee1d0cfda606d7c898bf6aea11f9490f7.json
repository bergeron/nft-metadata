    "description": "#01\n\n“The Life of Blue” is a collection of 36 multiple exposed polaroids that depict my dog, Blue, in the context of my room. \n\nThis medium has allowed me to explore a new form of expression, while still being able to tackle my reoccurring theme of nostalgia. It’s one of careful planning that achieves precise multiple ‘in camera’ exposures and requires no digital manipulation.\n\nThrough these photographs I found my way of honoring Blue, while coming to terms with my departure from my parents home.\n\nConnecticut, 2021-2022\n\nFirst owner can claim a VHS tape of the behind the scenes.\n\n1/1\n",
