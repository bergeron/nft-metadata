    "description": "I realized that I needed a song to send to girls I want to date. Gotta stand out ya feel. 'Hey beautiful' is basic af. THEN I thought, Hollup, I'm not the only one who could utilize this song for that purpose. So now I am releasing the song to the world so that Gs and Gdettez can get an increased closing rate on dating the shawdies they want to date. You're Welcome Wavy Ones.\n\n*WARNING I am not liable for any lost romantic partners*\n\n*BUT I AM liable for all romantic successes due to this song!* I accept hugs and ETH as payment for you all finding your wives. \n\nThis release also marks the BEGINNING of the $WAVY Gamez saga. See the 'Rewards' Section for the BREAKdown. ",
