    "description": "Artwork Notes\nThe cover artwork was generated in Carrara 3D, using a combination of organic tree structures superimposed with projections of violet and pink textures.\n\nAlbum Notes\nIn 2012 I went on a road trip for most of the year and traveled up the eastern sea board of Australia. A big goal of the trip was to produce an album on the road. Part of my process was about being inspired to create tracks based on the environment I was visiting, and not move on from that location till the track was locked away. Applying that kind of discipline was good because it meant I returned from my journey with an album of finished material.\n\nI am not much into photographs and did not take a camera with me, instead the Gamma album is my impressionistic sonic record of my journey. When I listen to it, the memories come rushing back through me, in the same way that you would get if you were looking through a photo album.",
