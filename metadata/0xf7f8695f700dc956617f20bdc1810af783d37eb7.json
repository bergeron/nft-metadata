    "description": "Loneliness is a choice.\nSometimes it's a choice in favor of yourself.  In the name of myself.  Out of self love.  And sometimes loneliness is fear.  Fear of suddenly being alone.  And that's why it's better to stay that way.  Close in a box of loneliness.  And forbid yourself to see the beautiful world around.\nBut even if you live in your box, the world around you still blooms and loves.  With you or without you.\n1/1 digital art by wellmarch 3543*3543 pxl 300 dpi ",
