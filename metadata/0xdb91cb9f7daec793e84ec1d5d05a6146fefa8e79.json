    "description": "''In a most unexpected moment during our conversation, she shares something beautiful- “Am I the castle ?\nLarge and daunting , built by architects of fears for years..\nOnly to set on fire ,\nBy you ....am I that piece of charcoal ?you keep away from white satin and paper .Afraid to touch me , for I stain them with dust and memory of the place we chose to forget and I so I stayed away ..\nSat upon the purest pure of self doubt ....like a wind up doll , sketching on the backyard walls ....” - My muse",
