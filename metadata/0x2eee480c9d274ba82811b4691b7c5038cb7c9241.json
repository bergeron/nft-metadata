    "description": "Ursine Utopia is a 10,000 piece NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, created by the Brothers In Bud. Each member of the Ursine Utopia has been brought into sentience by a mysterious strain of pot. These bears are not your typical cute and cuddly creatures. They are potheads who have been transformed into sentient beings with their own unique personalities and quirks. They love to smoke weed and are always on the lookout for the next best strain.",
