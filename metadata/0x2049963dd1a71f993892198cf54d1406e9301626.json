    "description": "In April of 2020, separated by an ocean and 3000 miles, both of us went into self-isolation. Physically, of course -- like everyone else. But also musically.\n\nTurning inwards, we scoured the Refs instrumental vault for our most menacing, introverted and brooding soundscapes -- and proceeded to write 12 songs in 12 days. 2 years later, we offer up our debut album, \"New Religion\".\t\t\t\n\nOur song \"I Should Be Alone Right Now\" featuring our friend Kevin Garrett mirrors the calm-before-the-storm state of the world circa April 2020. In some ways, it holds even more water now, in light of ever-present systemic and cultural decline.\t\t\n\nThe animated image we chose for artwork is a taste of an unreleased \"New-Religion\" themed collectable project. Owners of \"I Should Be Alone Right Now\" NFTs will get a sneak peak of what's to come.\n\n-Dessauer and Rich",
