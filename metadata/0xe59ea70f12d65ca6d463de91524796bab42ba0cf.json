    "description": "The Dalisby family complex project took about forty years to complete. Each of the new metaverse homes were light years wide. Each had several culdrons of new lighted materials available for making many new home worlds inside. As always the original lighted material’s contained zero radioactive poisons. Each new home would be seen for many light years away and in precise detail. Each original world had zero dust, zero plant decay, zero organic problems, zero pollution, and zero bug infestation.  No deceases to worry about, no seed plants nor trees.  100 percent all vegetation rooting systems.  The most heavenly environment available at the time.",
