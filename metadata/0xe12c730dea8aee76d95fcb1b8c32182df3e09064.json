    "description": "The Clod 699 is part of the Clod series that are the most important part of my work right now. I have been developing them for the last four years. They are what is left of our planet after it has been destroyed by intensive use by humans. The collapse of the planet then generated a myriad of clumps that have scattered into the space around it. On these pieces of land there are several survivors, who are, for better or worse, trying to rebuild a life and a civilization. All this is to give attention to the fact that the earth is one and humans are consuming it.\n\nUntil recently I used to create my Clods in Pixelart, but recently I started making them with the help of artificial intelligence. I process many different images to get a final animation that is a collage between different styles. I don't use the images as they are generated by ai, but I edit and transform them, adding different details built separately.\n\nThe genre is always the same and always about my Clods, but with a different graphic look!",
