    "description": "Who is she? \nThis blond woman standing in front of me. \n\nHer hair blowing in the wind, \nShe radiates in my dream. \n\nHer scent floats in the air we share. \nI feel lucky to stand in her world somewhere. \n\nI fuel my fantasy, \nCreating a universe where we are happy. \n\nShe doesn't know me, but I know her from the start. \nAt least the version I draw in my dead heart. \n\nI recreate each of our encounters, endlessly satisfied. \n\nBut who are you, my beautiful unknown blonde? \n\nYou travel through time, fighting against the destiny attributed to you by men. \n\nYou are not one who follows other people's dreams, \nIt is along your road that souls are lost in the gleams. \n\nLet me have a little space in your lonely boat. \nI'll try not to succumb to my heady road. \n\nYou take with you the best there is, \nAnd for the rest, the choice remains his.\n\n-VanLyxe\n\n** First piece of the Blond Woman Collection **",
