    "name": "Bored Joki Bath Tub",
    "description": "When you think of the subliminally dark arts Jotham or as we call him Joki taps into a part of our mind typically delegated to inspiring us with uncomfortable imagery.  There is a line between shock and enlightenment that can be skirted to create powerful pieces which he does. \n\nJoki and a few of us would regularly partake in group calls.  At that time I was the only publicly doxxed individual. Everyone else got the courage and started sending the group their photographs. Instead of a driver license photo our man Joki presented us with this testosterone infused bathtub sporting a sultry stare. I of course had to paint it and with consent brought our man to life in watercolors.  He deserves to be immortalized on the blockchain not just with his art but his image.",
