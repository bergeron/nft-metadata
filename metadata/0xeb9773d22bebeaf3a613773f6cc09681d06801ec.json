    "description": "The year has made me realize that acceptance is the most powerful characteristic\n\nThe only way to move forward in your life with faith and belief is to accept the truth\n\nAt one point, I found it hard to believe that everything could be fine, but when I realized that all I had to do was accept what was happening and keep believing, I began to believe again.\n\nAcceptance is being true to yourself and admitting that you have no control over the happenings  \nThe spiritual principle of acceptance is relinquishing control over to a higher power of your choosing and believing that when it runs the show for us, we are in much better hands.\n\nAcceptance is the willingness to let go of your emotional opposition to the reality of “what is.”  \nPeace begins with acceptance.",
