    "name": "Hazy Afternoon in NYC",
    "description": "Back in 2021, an unprecedented weather phenomenon happened in New York City. \nSmoke from wildfires raging several thousand miles away on the western coast of USA shrouded New York City in a blanket of haze. \nWhen I headed outside, I couldn't believe what I saw. The afternoon sun had created an otherworldly scene with midtown Manhattan buildings in soft silhouettes perfectly framing a dreamlike moment. \nI just had to take that shot!  ",
