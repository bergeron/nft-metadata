    "description": "\"The burdens in our minds is always heavier than the burdens on our shoulders.\" - Mehmet Murat ildan\n\nA Hero's Burden was born from a conversation on family leadership, parenthood, & mental health and inspired by Terrell Jones's (@terrelldom) 'Smoke Break'. \n\nWith the responsibility of protecting and saving the world, and never truly being able to satisfy the demand of everyone in need, who does the savior turn to when they need someone? How does one reconcile being the savior, yet knowing they cannot save everyone?",
