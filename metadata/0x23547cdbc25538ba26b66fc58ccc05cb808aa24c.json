You’re a fractal, a pattern that continuously changes.\n\nA multi drop series dedicated to refraction, fragmentation, geometric shaped pieces, and being a multy complex being; compiled of many faces, faces that have different shapes and sizes. Put all those fragmented pieces together, it makes you a being refracting the world around it and in doing so forming fragments from how the world changes you, and you allow the world to form you or not.",
