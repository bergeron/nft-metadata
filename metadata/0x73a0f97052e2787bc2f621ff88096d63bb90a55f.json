    "description": "A man wearing a mask walks on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, New York City, where I live, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic (June 9, 2020).\n\nJackon Heights was the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. \n\nIn late March of 2020, 13 people died of COVID-19 in our local hospital over a 24-hour-period when cases were well over twenty-thousand across the city.\n\nI went out to document my neighbors to see if they were truly wearing masks, which I believe was one of the main reason our city began to turn the corner. \n\nIt was a really scary time, fear fed by a fumbling U.S. administration, and the sheer terror of knowing people were dying in your neighborhood and it was difficult to trust what to believe from public authorities.\n\nLike a shadow of our fear walking before us. That is how it felt. This unknown reminded me of Thucydidesâ€™ descriptions of the plight of Athenians during the plague in his \"The History of the Peloponnesian Wars,\" my reference for this series. ",
