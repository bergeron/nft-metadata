    "description": "The journey between what you once were and who we are now becoming is where the dance of life really takes place. Each one of us has to travel our own path. It cannot be replicated or prescribed, because each one of us is unique and so are our circumstances. Take your journey all the way. Don't just do what you want to do. Do not pick and choose what you have the strength to deal with. Take all of it and do everything possible to change your life.",
