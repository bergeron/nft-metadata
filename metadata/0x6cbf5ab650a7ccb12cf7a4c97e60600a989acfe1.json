    "description": "Pipl is a philanthropic community that will continue to work with different artists and charitable organizations, releasing multiple collections focusing on our vision of giving back to the world and its people. At Pipl we believe in Love and Peace. But we believe that Love and Peace should not just exist in the virtual world. We also want to connect and contribute to the real world. With every collection we create, we will partner with different charitable organizations through donations and sponsorship. Our first collection, Pipl Genesis will be our first collaboration to provide real help to the real world. We believe every person who shares the same belief than the Pipl should join us in working together to make this world a better place.",
