    "description": "'Bhandenza'. This piece draws inspiration from the famous Fidenza paintings, and I used a similar colour palette to create it. It took a lot of time and effort to master this perspective, but I am delighted with the result.\n\nIn the future, I will be adding more perspective art pieces to my collection, \"Ode to Perspectives.\"\n\nI am grateful for the support of Zo Studio in creating this piece, and it is being curated as part of the 'Genesis with Zo' World on Foundation.",
