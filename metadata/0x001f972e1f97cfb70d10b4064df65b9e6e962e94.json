    "description": "Located to the south of the region. It's the capital of Motley Land due to its comercial and economical relevance. Even if it's the biggest city, it's not the most populated cause people moved to Leaf Village two decades ago, searching a healthier and more natural environment, running away form the pandemic. Now, just a few workers of the metal industry remain here.\nTemperature increased significantly these past ten years, so only those creatures who can resist extreme heat and scarce water supply can stay here.\n\nFire Borough residents hate random sh*tty NFT airdrops (unless its fine art, of course)\n\nStake Farms Companyâ„¢ has proudly the higher interest rate protocol to stake your coins in Motley Land.",
