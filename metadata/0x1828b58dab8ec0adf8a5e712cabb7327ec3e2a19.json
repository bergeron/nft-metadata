    "description": "\"Desert Trash\" is the title track on my first album that I released in Feb 2020 \n\nDue to covid and my cancelled tour, I always felt like these songs never really got to see the light of day.  Sure, it was released-- but the unprecedented times were a huge factor in my ability to market them and share them the way I'd been dreaming of for years. Obviously at the time there were much more important things to worry about.\n\nCircling back now, I would like to revisit a few of my favorite tracks on the album and share them with the web3 community <3\n\nI will be releasing a very limited quantity of select songs off this album in the next few weeks\n\n55 @ .05\n\n10 Presales will be available for free for anyone holding at least 2 Mija NFTs\n\nGolden Egg winner will receive a custom video of me performing \"Desert Trash\" on my acoustic guitar\n\nAppreciate ya'll for real \n\nLove, Mija",
