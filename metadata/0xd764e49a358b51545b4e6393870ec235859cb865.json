Originally a colour edit & After coming across it in my library I decided it needed this achromatic edit, This photograph & the edit speaks to me in a language I can feel more than interpret.\"\n\n.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
