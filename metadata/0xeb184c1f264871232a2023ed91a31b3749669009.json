    "description": "Better When It Ends. is an incredibly important song to me, written about one of the toughest experiences of my life. \nI hope it speaks to you in some way. \n\n\nI woke up screaming out loud\npulled all your pictures down\nset fire to everything inside my room\nthat smells like you \nand I woke up screaming out loud\n\nand now I don't look back\nand I don't look down\nnow when I'm flying \nover your town\nwith all of my bruises\nalmost all faded out\n\ncause you're the kind of dream\nthat's better when it ends\nI should have seen it \ncoming from back then\nwhen I thought love meant hurting\nyou were my favorite person\nbut you're the kind of dream\nthat's better when it -\n\nI woke up screaming your name\nand I called but you never came\nI drowned while you watched from the sand\nwith my life in your hands \nand a smile on your face\n\nbut now I don't look back \nand I don't look down\nnow when I'm flying \nover your town\nwith all of my bruises\nalmost all faded out\n\ncause you're the kind of dream\nthat's better when it ends\nI should have seen it \ncoming from back then\nwhen I thought love meant hurting\nyou were my favorite person\nbut you're the kind of dream\nthat's better when it ends.",
