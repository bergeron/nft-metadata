    "description": "A Time Lapse of the moon rising above Telluride, Colorado, USA. Captured in February of 2022.\nThis sequence is composed of 516 photographs that were captured over the course of approximately 90 minutes.\nGoing into the last half of 2021, my experience with time lapse photography was minimal, and even less for night photography. I dedicated time to improving in both of these areas and quickly surprised myself with what I was creating.\nI struggled in a lot of different areas at first, but the most difficult part was overcoming the fear of standing in the mountains at night for an extended period of time. Thankfully my desire to create these less-common images and clips was stronger than my fear of being stalked by a mountain lion in the pitch dark.\nThis video features shooting stars, airplanes, a subtle fog forming in the valley, cars entering and exiting the town of Telluride, glowing resort hotels in the town of Mountain Village, and snowcats grooming ski slopes.\n- Wilder\n\n\n\n\n",
