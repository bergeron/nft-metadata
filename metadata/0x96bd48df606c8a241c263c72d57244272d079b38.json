    "description": "One of my favorite things to do is stare at the sky and daydream. I love seeing the moon, clouds, and stars. But sometimes these elements can be blocked or hard to see when there are too many clouds. Inspired by the Pixar short film La Luna (2011), I started to think that what if - there is a secret job up there that they hire people to clean the clouds or maintain in the sky to make sure it’s “clean” so we can see it better? \n\n",
