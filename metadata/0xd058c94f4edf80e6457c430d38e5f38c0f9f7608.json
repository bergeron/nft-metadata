    "description": "Tatiana said that thinking about her past and overanalazing it leaves her anxious and distracts from being present. On the other hand, she finds inspiration in memories and interactions she had with people during her life and it inspires her to create something new. She's a talanted illustrator and what always mesmerised me is how she paints people's faces from abstract lines and figures out of nowhere in just a few short moments. She really impressed me with how human can perceive reality differently and project it back on canvas.\n\nShot on Kodak ColorPlus 200 film using 1978 Canon AE-1 manual camera.\n\nKyiv, Ukraine\n2021",
