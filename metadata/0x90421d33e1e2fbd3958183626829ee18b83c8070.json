    "description": "Some Cartoon Heroes can fly. Others can make bananas reappear. Some are aliens stranded on the Earth. Yet some are not anywhere you can find. Cartoon Heroes are hilarious and not to be taken too seriously. They hail from all walks of our shares culture and some come from the greater beyond. They all enjoy a good laugh and usually do not mind a casual conversation or a friendly stroll.\n\nCartoon Heroes are AI generated characters by Mad Monk using DALLÂ·E. Some of the first creations were collaborations with fellow creators using similar prompts on the AI algorithm. The project is initially released August 2022 on Mad Monk's own smart contract CARTOON HEROES deployed with Manifold.",
