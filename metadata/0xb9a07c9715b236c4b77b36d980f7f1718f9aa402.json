    "description": "Every year millions of tourists go hiking in the mountains to enjoy the clean air and drink from the cleanest mountain streams. People bring their own food in bags, but not many take their trash with them to town. It's little things like this that start global pollution. Never leave garbage in the wilderness that doesn't decompose! Remember, human and nature are one!",
