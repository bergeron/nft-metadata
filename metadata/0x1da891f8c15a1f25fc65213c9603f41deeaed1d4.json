    "description": "Work in the style of light painting . There is no Photoshop and effects added programmatically in the photo . A fiber-optic brush and a RGB flashlight were used as a light brush. The photo turned out with 26 attempts . The exposure time is 7 seconds .\n\nLight painting, painting with light, light drawing, or light art performance photography are terms that describe photographic techniques of moving a light source while taking a long exposure photograph, either to illuminate a subject or space, or to shine light at the camera to 'draw', or by moving the camera itself during exposure of light sources. Practiced since the 1880s, the technique is used for both scientific and artistic purposes, as well as in commercial photography.",
