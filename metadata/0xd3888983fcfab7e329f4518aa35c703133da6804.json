    "description": "A new year, a new smart contract. Here's to my first 1/1 minted on a custom contract.\n\nNo better way to celebrate new beginnings than with a glass of cheap tequila poured into a champagne flute. \n\nBetween the day I took this photo, and when I got the film developed I injured my back. I have now spent over a year disabled. I don't know if I will ever stand without pain again so this shoot has a special meaning to me even if the images are a little on the nose. \n\nI have spent most of my adult life photographing women, and I spend a lot of time thinking about how I present my subjects. I can't ever eliminate my \"male gaze\" but I can be thoughtful about it and I make an effort to not objectify my subjects. But the same time my work is collaboration between myself and the models I photograph and who am I to say no to a perfectly placed prop? Once and awhile a good photo is a good photo and you just have to send it. \n\nThanks so much to my friends Chloe and Faith for making images with me that I will never forget.",
