    "description": "If there is such a thing as \"in the middle of nowhere\", this place is one of them! Kubu Island. It is located in Botswana, but even by the standards of this distant country, this place is \"far away\".\n\nKubu Island is surrounded by endless marshy flat Botswana salt pans and most of the year is inaccessible by humans. There is nothing here except large granite rocks, ancient Baobab trees and small lizards. There is no light pollution, which makes this place look like a landscape from another planet.\n\nAn ideal place for those who are weary of civilization and want to be alone with themselves!",
