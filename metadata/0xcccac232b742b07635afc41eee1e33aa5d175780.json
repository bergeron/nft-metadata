    "description": "Awarded to those who minted a Goober during the private and public sale during Fall of 2021. ChemiCo, the leading company in high end hair products, furiously searches for ways to improve their revenue. In desperate attempts to complete this goal, they unknowingly create Goobers, sentient Goo like beings that attempt to flee the facility where they were made, mistakenly also taking the prized secret formula that ferments within their very DNA.",
