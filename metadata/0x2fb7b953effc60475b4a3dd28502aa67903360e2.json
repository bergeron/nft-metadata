    "description": "Light Years is a project from generative artist Dmitri Cherniak in partnership with The Estate of László Moholy-Nagy. It is an homage to the photogram as a medium, but with a digitally native twist. Each of the 100 unique editions was created by a code-based generative system, then hand-prepared and printed to a film negative. A high definition scan of the negative was used to develop the image as a silver gelatin print which can be claimed by the first collector of the artwork.",
