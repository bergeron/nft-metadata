    "description": "This piece is part of the 'Monochrome Dreams' series. The story is told from the perspective of female octopus who is love with a pearl diver.\n\n✧ ✧ ✧\n\nDay by day I'm watching you diving and collecting pearls. Your eyes are ardent like the burn of the medusa. Your hair are like algae flickered by the underflows. Your lips are scarlet like poisonous corals. Your skin is shining like fish scales. I gave you my heart. You are the most beautiful human creature in the ocean. When I sleep, I see you in my dreams. I touch you, I kiss you, I squeeze your hips so tight that you breathe frequently. You fade away as I wake up and I'm looking forward to fall asleep again and see you, my beloved one.\n\n✧ ✧ ✧\n\nAthens, 2022",
