    "description": "In a world where technology and nature coexist, there is a group of highly skilled warriors known as the Cyber Ape's Ninja clan. They are a secretive group, rarely seen by outsiders, but their reputation precedes them. The Cyber Ape's Ninja clan was founded centuries ago by a group of apes who were enhanced with cybernetic implants. These implants gave them incredible strength and agility, making them formidable warriors. As their skills grew, so did their numbers. The clan began to accept members from other species, as long as they were willing to undergo the grueling training and cybernetic enhancements required to join.",
