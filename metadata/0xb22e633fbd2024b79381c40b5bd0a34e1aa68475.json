    "description": "Combat Conditions, the lead single from my new release, Combat EP, represents the last 2 years of a creative idea, bringing a project to life. Whatever conditions are put in front of you, always be ready for combat. \n\nIf you collect Combat Conditions, Kaleidoscope and Gravel Red you can claim a free signed copy including postage and packaging of the Combat EP 12\" vinyl. I'll also include a signed Onyx EP 12\" vinyl. I've decided to mint the extended version over the radio edit as I wanted everyone to experience the full length version as it was produced. \n\nThis is an opportunity to own the digital collectible and the physical collectible. Early support on the EP from DJ's such as Nicole Moudaber, Anja Schneider, Truncate and many others. \n\n\"The opening track, Combat Conditions, pairs a bubbling bassline with deep drums, filtered stabs, and delay-soaked arpeggios. Both spacey and vibrant, Acutek manages to balance a laid-back style with forward-moving attitude. Perfect for any situation from 5AM warehouse settings to soundtracking a rainy summerâ€™s day.\"\n\nIt's great to bring this EP to the blockchain and I hope you enjoy it. \n\nArtwork by Ross.Cracked\nMastering by Rob Small Mastering Ltd\nVocal Credit to: Library of Congress, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division.",
