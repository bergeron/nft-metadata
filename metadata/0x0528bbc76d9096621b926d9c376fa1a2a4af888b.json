    "description": "Positano, the vertical city\n\nFew places are as beautiful and romantic as the Amalfi Coast of Italy. The warmth, the colours, the energy. It is such a special place.\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to tour the whole coastline by boat and see some of the most iconic locations the Amalfi has to offer, but once I saw Positano, I couldn't believe just how beautiful this place really is.\n\nThe legend says that the city was founded by Poseidon, the God of the sea, for the love of the nymph Pasitea. This is why I decided to call this piece ‘Amanti’ which translates to ‘lovers’.",
