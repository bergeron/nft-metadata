    "description": "Horror's not to be ignored, atrocities forever burned, a sacrifice made for an ideal. 'Freedom's Price' visually explores the inexplicable sacrifice made in the name of Freedom, a luxury enjoyed by those who have not seen the price it costs. For those who have, the scars are permanent, a constant reminder of the price paid for the greater good. Worth it in the name of honor, the internal devastation is softened but never forgotten.\n\nExhibition piece at Mecenate Fine Art - NFT gallery for the \" AI is freedom \" event.",
