    "description": "Forgotten Wolves is a collection of 1/1 hyperrealistic art, but it goes far beyond that. The purpose of Forgotten Wolves is to express what starts as an idea, thought, or emotion, that can transform itself into a knowing, and a feeling.. of the power that we hold inside us. A level that we can tap into, that some of us never realize. Forgotten Wolves is meant to shine light and awareness on the spirit within that you have been unable to bring to the surface, or unaware of entirely. The wolf, is the surface, but hidden within the wolf is something much deeper, something divine, that we all share as one. Through this collection we seek to spread awareness of this truth that you have forgotten, to guide you to open your mind and heart to a reality much greater within yourself.",
