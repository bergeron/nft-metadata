    "description": "The green eyed monster is awake in me again. I can the feel the sharp claws of envy tearing at me from within yet again. \n\"When will it be me?\"  \n\"Will it ever be my turn?\"  \n\"Yes, something good happened to you, but why not me?\"  \nAll of these questions and more run through my head as the envy clouds my mind and despair begins to set in.\n\nThrough these green clouds of envy, a little thought sparks and begins to bloom. Then I ask myself,  \n\"What do I need to do differently?\"  \n\"What do I need to stop doing?\"  \n\"How can I be better at what I do while I wait my turn?\"\n\nYes, I feel envious sometimes, but I am only human and it's okay to feel things. It's only through recognising and handling these emotions in a healthy way can we learn to be better and not let them rule us.",
