    "description": "1/1 digital art be alexa_kiri. What if one day technology becomes very close to us? Would that be good or bad? What if technology were to grow to the point where people from other planets could visit us? What if robots walk among us? Would we be able to be friends? We can only speculate and imagine.

We should not be afraid of technology; it fills our lives. We should be friends.",
