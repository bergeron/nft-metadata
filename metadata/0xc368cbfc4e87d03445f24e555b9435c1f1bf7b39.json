    "description": "It is when we are at our lowest, that we are able to look at something we have been ignoring for so long, our fragile sense of self crumbles, letting us see the light of what really mattered after all, pain is so unbearable nothing from the outside can distract us anymore, and we are forced to look at ourselves. We then find out how everything we held on to is bound to end, everything becomes fragile, meaningless. Is this a hopeless realization? Or is it the truth that will set us free?",
