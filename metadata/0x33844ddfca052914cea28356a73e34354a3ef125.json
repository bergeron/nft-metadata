    "description": "Fall in Luv\"\n\nI have been drawing Luv-chan for a long time.\nRecently, people started saying \"Luv-chan is so cute! and they started to draw it for me.\nThis is like a dream come true for me. I have always dreamed of seeing many Luv-chan painted by hands other than mine.\nI am not the only one who has made it possible for everyone to draw Luv-chan.\nThanks to everyone who has supported me this far, I was able to see this view.\n\nThe costume and background design for this Luv-chan was conceived by arino sakura (Twitter -> @NFT0226). I am a big fan of hers and am truly honored. Thank you!\n\nAs for the title of the work, looking at everyone's Luv-chan again reminded me of my love for Luv-chan when I first started drawing her.\nEvery time I look at everyone's drawings of Luv-chan, I fall in love with Luv-chan at first sight.\nI chose this title to express my greatest love to everyone who reminded me of her.\n\nTo all of you who support me, to all of the creators who draw me, thank you so much!\n",
