    "description": "Five posts still standing that formed part of the original wooden sea defences at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, UK. These have been replaced in part by a line of rocks to protect the bottom of the cliffs. The fact is though Happisburgh has been losing land to the sea for centuries. Despite mans' efforts on average about three metres a year are still lost to the sea, which is about the same it has always has been.\n\nThis photograph was taken using an extremely long shutter speed. This was done to add movement to not only the see around the posts but also to add a sense of movement to the sky to match. Of course I also needed to deploy a good pair of Wellington boots. \n",
