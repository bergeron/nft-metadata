    "name": "The Liberty Lady is Melting",
    "description": "The Liberty Lady was once a proud symbol of freedom and democracy. But now, she's melting. Her skin is turning dark grey, and the magenta background that once shone so brightly is fading away. The gold and yellow materials that make up her figure are falling off, piece by piece.\n\nNo one knows why the Liberty Lady is melting. Some say it's because of the new tax laws that have been passed, or because of the war overseas. Others say it's a sign of America's decline, and that we're headed for disaster.\n\nBut still, the Liberty Lady melts away day by day, until she's nothing but a memory.",
