    "description": "Photographic Series: Flor de Cayeno\n\nLike the energy of the moon and the sun in nature, our bodies contain feminine and masculine energies that, when placed in total balance, make us flourish. FLOR DE CAYENO, the name of this photographic series, is the feeling of the energy of mother nature in the male body, freely playing to drop its rigid mask to see its natural root of freedom.\n\nCollaboration with performers @doncayeno",
