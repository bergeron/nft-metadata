    "description": "Blue could be best identified as the uncle motif. I  felt that this vignette should represent the mid-90s classic Black man whose upkeep was high priority. Never misses a step, waves consistently swimming, VHS collection on lock. We all knew a Blue. Whether it was our father, uncle, brother or significant other, he set his own standard of Black male beauty.",
