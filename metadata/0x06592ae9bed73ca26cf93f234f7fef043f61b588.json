    "description": "This collection was commissioned by [These Lads Are Mental](https://www.theseladsaremental.com/) for a charity exhibition celebrating [ABC's Space 22](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/space-22) program showcasing art therapy for mental health.\n\nThis collection of 3 images is an abstraction of the journey the participants took through the art therapy process.\n\nThe images embody the physical journey as they progress from rigid, isolated and in the spotlight of image 1; then begin to open up, make connections and grow in image 2; to then finish in a celebration of connection, colour and life as they bloom into image 3.\n\nThe parallel theme running through these images is the impact that art therapy can have on the brain. With the dark, oppressive burden of mental illness hanging over the mind, the art therapy penetrates through and infiltrates to illuminate and lighten. \n",
