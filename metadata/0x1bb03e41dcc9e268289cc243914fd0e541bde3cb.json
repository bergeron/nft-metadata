    "description": "DISTRACTED IDENTITIES by Jeremy Austin are 15 mischievous characters getting loose at the Blockparty, your character is hanging out with a few friends and your whereabouts is determined by when you arrived at the party. Once the party is full (all the blocks are collected), the composite artwork will be created and the individual blocks will be numbered and updated accordingly to show who you are hanging out with, a hint of the other characters will be visible within each block to show who is sitting either side, above and below. 15 editions of the composite artwork titled DISTRACTED IDENTITY BLOCKPARTY will be minted and airdropped to each of the character block holders.",
