    "description": "When it gets too dark to see with the naked eye, I play with light to capture traces of a performance of dancing light and human stillness. During the few seconds while the picture is being taken, Kim looks at the stars in the silence of the night. In those moments it seems like time has slowed down.\n\nThis picture was created in a few seconds using light-painting photography technique. During the exposure time, Kim stays still while I wave the light behind her.",
