    "description": "Picasso's Dove is an international symbol of peace. One of its versions is located in Kharkiv, Ukraine.\nAnd this is “Peace in Ukraine”. \nHer wings are tied, like the hands of civilians shot dead by Russian soldiers in the suburbs of Kyiv. \nShe is being bombed, just as Ukrainian cities are being bombed, whose inhabitants, falling asleep, do not know if they will wake up tomorrow. \nShe was raped, as Ukrainian women and even children were raped on occupied territories. \nShe is dying of hunger and thirst, as the residents of blockaded Mariupol are dying. \nShe is trying to survive, as millions of Ukrainian refugees are trying to survive, whose homes and families have been destroyed and robbed by Russian army. \nHow long will this continue and what lies ahead?\n\n03.04.22\n39-th day of war",
