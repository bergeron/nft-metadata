    "description": "K端hner #43/98 Fraktale Mutationen 1 (2014)\n\nFrieder K端hner experimented with the software \"Paint\" in 2014 and 2015 and created 98 digital compositions. They remained unpublished until today. Now the medium of NFT offers the appropriate platform to publish these small masterpieces accordingly. We are creating most of these \"Paint\" files as unique NFTs, and we are publishing some as NFT editions of an appropriate number. If you like, this work is a combination of analogue creativity with the digital world. What has been done many times in analogue form has been developed in a more complex way in digital form, and now, in a third step, the development of blockchain technology offers the possibility of uncomplicated visualisation and the granting of ownership rights. Each individual work and each step is consistently realised in itself, but not elaborated. Possibilities arise and are understood as an extension. Thus the now visible NFT stands as a synonym for the whole, for it is the last piece for the time being of the developments taking place. The last one for the time being, because others will follow. According to the coming development.",
