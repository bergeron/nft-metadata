    "description": "Drawing upon ancient Hawaii wisdom and tradition Sumarac transposes the faraway mantra of reconciliation upon our cacophonous contemporary me-first mind. The Hawaiian intuition holds that negative energy is trapped in our cells our self-isolating thoughts. Collectively these vibes create war, violence, crime and misery.  Meditating on the mantra releases us from our self-imposed isolation, blame, friction and distance bringing mankind back into harmony with itself. In short, the simple mantra touches upon the universal need for healing that starts with one’s own responsibility – be it personal or social. Paradoxically the mantra can also be viewed as a naïve esoteric value system that treats social and political strife as mere psychological discord resolvable by goodwill and purity of heart. Finally, using the hitherto consumerist medium of billboards as a stage for reflection upon our over-loaded minds and our dysfunctional system creates a cognitive dissonance that cannot be ignored.",
