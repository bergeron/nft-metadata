    "description": "My journey on sound & my true genesis into Web 3 begin with \"Affirmations\"\n\nAffirmations is the foundational piece I created as a reminder to myself (and anyone who would listen) to not only LIVE in but THRIVE in my purpose. Things have been nothing short of amazing for me the past year in Web 3. A large part of my purpose is community building. I've built relationships in a short period of time that feel like they'll last a lifetime and for this I'm beyond grateful. \n\nOne of the first people to show genuine love to me in this space is none other than my brother, Samurai D3f! (D3fbot). Samurai is one of the most sincere and giving people that I know. The guy is incredible and thats goes before you get to any of his numerous talents. It's because of Samurai that I'm a member of the Loser Club. It's because of Samurai (and Papi & GRL) that I can call The Outsiders family. It's because of Samurai that I'm a ZIPSHARK! Thank you brother! \n\nAt every turn Samurai is always impressing me whether it's with his production or his incredible visual artwork or just his commitment to supporting the people around him.\n\nIt's because of D3fb0t's nature that this \"Retwist\" of Affirmations was born and I couldn't think of a better way to pay it back to him and pay it forward by bringing him on board to Sound as we close the year. \n\nRetwisted By D3fb0t\nOriginally Produced By June Jissle, Tito G & Big Racco\nEngineered By Scolla Fungwe  \nArtwork By Scolla Fungwe & Retested By D3fb0t\n\n\n\n",
