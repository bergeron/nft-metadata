    "description": "My original oil painting, \"Tabby Night\", animated. I've painted over 160 cats and dogs this way! This series went viral on Bored Panda and My Modern Met!\n\nAll of my NFTs are made by hand animating my original oil paintings using hundreds of individual movement and stabilization points, bringing them to life. Each is a 1 of 1 ensuring a completely unique and original art piece.\n\nTabby Night\nEdition: 1 of 1\nFormat: 1200x1200px, 24fps, mp4\nDuration: 6 seconds on an infinite loop\nYear: 2022\n\nThank you so much for your interest in my art! ~Aja",
