    "description": "An image crafted from the depths of my mind and soul. I made this photo during some of my darkest days many years ago. During these times when I had nothing left to turn to but my art, I made this photo known as Phantasm. This particular image played a large roll in helping me from a very dark place. An image that would later pave the way for me developing my craft and creating unique one of a kind starscapes that each hold a strong bond to my soul.\n\nThis is my first NFT and starts off my venture into Web3\n\nThe collector of this piece will receive a 12x18 metal print of this art.\n\n",
