    "description": "I chose a yellow butterfly for my new hologram, symbolising the arrival of recovery, of something exciting and new for all of us. Then I made a blue butterfly fluttering in the air, a symbol of man's search for harmony. Blue is a symbol of communication through creativity, an emblem of loyalty and idealism. The butterfly moults and is transformed into a new individual, a water butterfly that merges with planet earth, represented here in the form of an egg, an ancestral symbol of life, fertility and rebirth: the key element in a very complicated mythology. A world that I see in my imagination as clear, transparent, free of evil, ecologically sustainable. This, in a nutshell, is my blueprint for a better world.",
