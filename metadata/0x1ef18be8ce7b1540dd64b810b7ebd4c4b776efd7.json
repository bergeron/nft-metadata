    "description": "This is a companion piece to \"Matriarch\" on SuperRare. It is another image captured during my most magical wildlife encounter ever. This is Grizzly 399 with three of her four two-year-old cubs about three weeks before she sent them all out on their own. There is one male cub known for his wandering, and it is difficult to capture all five bears at once at this age because of him. Fortunately, \"Matriarch\" is an image of all five bears taken a few minutes before this photo. The bears headed fairly straight toward the few of us photographing them and then turned to head into the trees, where the cubs played and ran around chasing each other. It was such an incredible encounter. I named this image \"Abbey Road\" because, from the moment I saw this shot, it reminded me of the grizzly version of the cover of \"Abbey Road\" by the Beatles. Once I saw that comparison in my head, I couldn't even come up with a better name.",
