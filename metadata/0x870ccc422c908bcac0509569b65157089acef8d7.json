    "description": "UAZ-SGR, or as people call it \"Bukhanka\" (The \"Loaf\"), is a Soviet four-wheel-drive minibus, the first model of which was released in 1958.\n\nThe \"Loaf\" is used throughout the entire post-Soviet space: orderlies transport patients; farmers transport vegetables; builders rush to objects. And in some already faulty \"Loaves\" that are idle in suburban areas, children equip huts (playhouses).\n\nDuring an excursion in Aktobe region of the Republic of Kazakhstan, we stopped at a gas station. There was a \"Loaf\" — round, gray, aged, but still elegant. It reminded me of all the minibuses I had seen in my homeland. The sunset rays of the autumn sun intensified nostalgia. I clicked the shutter of the camera, and a moment later a man in a bright orange robe appeared, sat down in a \"Loaf\" and drove the car along the yellowing field of the eternal steppe. Leaving me alone with my thoughts and memories.\n\nPhoto by Ignat Shumilin\n\nCamera — Fujifilm XT-2\nLens — Fujinon 18mm",
