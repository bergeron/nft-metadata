    "description": "Manila North Cemetery, Philippines, June 2016. \nA baby child in a swinging cot inside a mausoleum where a family have their home.\n\nDue to poverty and overpopulation, an estimated 10.000+ people are literally living with the dead at Manila North Cemetery. The owners of the graves allow people to to live among, and on the graves - and even inside the mausoleums - if the keep the graves clean.\n\n20% of sales will go to support Kapatiran-Kaunlaran foundation and to help parents buy school uniforms and books, so their three to six-year-old children can attend the free morning preschool run at the cemetery by the foundation.\n",
