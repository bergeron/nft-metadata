    "name": "The Art of Palm Wine Tapping",
    "created_by": "Real_ifyarts",
    "description": "The process of tapping the palm wine is risky; if the palm wine tapper is not careful, he may fall and become paralyzed.\n\nDue to the wrong palm wine tappers serving as leaders, Nigeria has social unrest, political instability, corruption, ritual killings, kidnappings, and other forms of injustice.\n\nHaving been successfully tapped, it is drunk joyfully, defying all odds by bringing together people of various ethnicities and religions.\n\nThis artwork links the palm wine tapper's risk to the prayer for a good leader who would go against all odds for the good of his subjects. It reflects Nigerians' desire for a better country, one that upholds the nation's flag's ideals of peace, unity, and the absence of corruption.\n\nThe optimism and prayers of Nigerians for a better tomorrow are portrayed in this artwork, just as palm wine unites people with gourds.\n\nÂ© MISS EKANEM",
