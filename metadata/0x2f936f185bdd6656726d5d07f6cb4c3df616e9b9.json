    "description": "Aged, battered by entropy, but still immortal, the Guardian Aleister endures even beyond the ephemera of structured civilization. “Portrait of Aleister” by Devon DeJardin is a first-of-its-kind digital painting and a perfect experiment between the physical and the digital, between man and machine, between the known and the unknown. The work was created by combining hand-built oil on canvas with digital brushwork, art studio sessions with photoshop, pigments with stable diffusion. Man and machine. Sweat equity and quantum probability. This is the first.",
