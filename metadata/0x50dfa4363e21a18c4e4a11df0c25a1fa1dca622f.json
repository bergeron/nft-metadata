    "description": "From the moment I arrived in Buenos Aires, I was drawn to the city's colorful buses. At first, it was the bright and varied color palette that caught my eye and inspired me to capture them on camera. But as I continued to photograph these vehicles, I found myself increasingly captivated by the reflection of the city on their surfaces and the people who travelled in them. \n\nPhotography 2022/2023\nJPEG\n6240px X 4160px\n300 DPI\n",
