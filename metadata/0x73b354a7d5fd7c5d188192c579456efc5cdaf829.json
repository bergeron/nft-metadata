I remember myself standing on another vessel and seeing this moment through my camera, and it felt like I had a time machine and traveled back in time where people had no electric power but they had real adventures.\n\nAll profit from this NFT goes to support artists who coming from Ukraine/Russia to California. \nI personally work on this project, providing food, shelter and financial support for any artist who lost their home because of the war.
