    "description": "There is no dominant between the sound and the graphic in Good Vibrations. They are all driven by logic and algorithms. It's a record of times in B-side, it's like a music sheet of Good Vibration. Just read those records. The past, the present and the future, all happened at the same time. You must listen to the vibration, write down the sheet in the time. It's about coincidence, circulation and the way how we count time. Itâ€™s all about Good Vibrations. https://artblocks.io/token/140000001/",
