    "description": "\"Star\" ⭐️ \n\nWe all dreamed at least once in life, to be a star.\nThat’s what society want us to be inspired to.\nThis piece will invite to you to think about the “behind the scenes” of a star.\nWhen the spotlight will abandoned you, and the lights will be turned off, what will happen? \n\nAn eternal conflict between perdition and balance.\nWhen the drop curtains will be closed, the temptations got the power, and here start the conflict.\n\nWill you be able to resist to it? \n\nThe top part of the star represents the balanced side. While in the sides of the star dominate the perdition.",
