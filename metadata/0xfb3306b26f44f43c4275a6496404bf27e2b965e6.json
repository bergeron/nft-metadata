    "description": "The Australian landscape is one that will always take you by surprise. No matter how much time I spend in search of these unique salt lakes, I still find myself lost for words. After taking time off from photographing salt lakes to visit family, I had a fire in me to capture something new and exciting. Weeks of research, planning and days of driving lead me to this rural salt lake in South Australia. Seeing these trees in a perfect formation at the edge of a salt lake had me wondering how and why they were there. To think in 30 years, these trees could still be perfectly preserved is something that blows me away. If you look at the top tree and work your way down the line, it looks like the different stages of a tree decomposing. Everything in this image is real and captured using my drone. Iâ€™m excited to release a piece that reflects my unique style and have this be my first mint of 2023. ",
