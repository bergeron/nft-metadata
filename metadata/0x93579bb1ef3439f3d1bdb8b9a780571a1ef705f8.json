    "description": "Title: History \nArtist: Lisa Llarena\nEdition: 1/1 \n4000 x 6000 px \n\nCollection: Braille \n\nI walked through the woods finding these tiny landscapes in a meditative state, feeling everything fully. All the exquisite, complex textures so raw and real, reminding me that things are beautiful as they are and how we found them. \n\nHistory written, an irreversible record of all that has transpired and touched them. Each event leaving a mark—every ray of sunshine, every drop of rain. Stories found in scars, jagged edges, the parts that turn brittle or hard, and what persists and remains. \n\n—\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use this photo for display privately and in groups including virtual galleries, as long as the artist is credited.
