    "description": "A very personal piece.\n\nTaken in the Bahamas, a trip that was taken with my close friend Elliot to start the next Chapter of my life.\n\nI had spent all my savings on a new modded Infrared Camera, and the plane ticket to get to the Bahamas. I had always wanted to try photography, and was encouraged by my good friend GMUNK who took the time to show me the ropes on how to capture the invisible Spectrum.\n\nThis is probably one of my favourite photos ever and has lots of significance to me for those reasons.",
