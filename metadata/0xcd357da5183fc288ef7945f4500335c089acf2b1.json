    "description": "In the far reaches of the Himalayan Mountains, there is a legend of an ancient undiscovered tree known as the Old Tree. It is said that this tree holds the secret to eternal life, and that its branches contain a magical elixir that can grant anyone who drinks it eternal youth. Many have searched for this tree throughout history, but it has remained elusive, hidden in the highest peaks of the mountain range. Some believe that it is protected by powerful guardian spirits, while others believe that it simply doesn't want to be found. Many have ventured into the Himalayas in search of the Old Tree, but none have returned with solid evidence of its existence. Some say that those who do find it are never the same again - they become immortal and are unable to leave the mountain range, trapped by the tree's powerful magic. The mystery of the Tree of Immortality continues to captivate the imaginations of those who hear the legend, and many continue to search for it to this day.",
