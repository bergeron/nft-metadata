    "name": "Portrait Of A Guard - Jiang Hu",
    "description": "This was a portrait of the security guard of the block I lived in at the time.  Some of the guards were friendly, others not so. He was a friendly one.  They wore old army clothes as uniforms.  His confident, unbridled expression made me smile .  Authority versus freedom with a smattering of humour.",
