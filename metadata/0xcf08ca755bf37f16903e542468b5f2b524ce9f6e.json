    "description": "This work reflects, in my opinion, the essence of the current world in which we live. Human life, as we imagined it, is receding further and further into the background.\nAnd I only show how I see the result of our existence.\nWe are on the edge when humanity and morality begin to dissolve like grains of sand in the desert. Only the bare shell remains. If we do not realize in time who we really are, then the sunset will come for everyone.\n\nMade with Cinema4d + Redshift.\nRes.: 1080x1350",
