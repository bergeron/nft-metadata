    "description": "252 shards have been dispersed throughout the lands of Seridyl. Most of the townsfolk have hid these relics away, while others sold them to local merchants for small amounts of SCHIL.\n\nThe leaders of the four factions have sent mercenaries to hunt these shards. It's said that holding more than one of the same shard can give its holder powers of the ancients.",
