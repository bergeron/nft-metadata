    "description": "Like a lot of the time ‘Dragging Chords’ was created when I got a new piece of software. I use Reason for producing and they’d recently released their fantastic Chord Sequencer. I ran a pattern out of Reason to trigger my Roland JV-2080 and the result was the main piano/synth you hear in the track. The groove on this is quite pacey and rolling. I wanted to create something for the dancefloor that was uplifting and positive.",
