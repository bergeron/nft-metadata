    "description": "'This image is part of my project Santa Barbara Return Jobs to US. I am interested in images that suggest an idea of a place without giving away too much of what that place is. I like images that leave open doors for the viewer to imagine and create new stories.' TIME x FOTOBook artist Alejandro Cartagena offered this piece as part of TIME's Artist Spotlights collection. Established to deepen relationships between our artists and our holders, this free airdrop was sent to longstanding holders in celebration of TIMEPieces 1-year anniversary.
