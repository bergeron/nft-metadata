    "description": "H.R. Giger's \"\" Necronom (Alien), 2005” is a timeless, iconic sculpture reflecting Giger’s artistic prowess and profound cultural influence. Standing as his most acclaimed work, this life-sized sculpture of a humanoid figure with long arms, an extended head, and sinewy muscles is a testament to Giger’s skill at tapping into the human psyche, through fears associated with death, sexuality, bodily violation and terror. \n\nParticle acquired the physical scultpture from its previous owner, and particliased its ownership into 500 Particle NFTs. Each NFT represents legal ownership of the physical work of Art, and governance rights towards it as stipulated in the Terms of Sale. The work was subsequently loaned to the non-profit Particle foundation to tour the world for the benefit of its co-ownership.",
