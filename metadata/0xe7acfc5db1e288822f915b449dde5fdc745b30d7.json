    "description": "One summer day in 2015 little Khrystyna from the village Popasnoyu she woke up without a single hair. “She didn’t have hair, eyebrows, or eyelashes,” says her mother Iryna. The hardest time during war was winter of 2015 with constant gunfire and bombings, but one day was especially horrifying for the family. Howl and rumble of artillery was fast, strong, and sudden, and the child was already asleep. This cruel and scary awakening could have caused excessive stress for the girl, her mother thinks. Soon after Khrystyna began to lose her hair, until one day it was completely gone. Countless medical appointments, screenings, and testing did not find any physical condition that could have cause this. Today, Khrystyna is 5. She is a very energetic, happy, and talkative girl. Says she likes to run and jump.",
