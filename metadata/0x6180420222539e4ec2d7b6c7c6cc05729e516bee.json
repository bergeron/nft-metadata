    "description": "Painted Virtual Furniture is a collection of dynamic phygital furniture that reflects the renaissance of traditional analog painting in the post-digital age. It explores the transformation process from 2D physical brush strokes to 3D digital objects. At first, We explored color combinations and stroke shapes with acrylic paints in the physical world. Then the brush strokes were digitally sampled and assigned to a set of baroque style furniture in order to manipulate both the representation and design of such objects. During this process, the original information carried on the analog paint stokes has been shifted, challenging the traditional dualistic relationship between analog and digital.",
