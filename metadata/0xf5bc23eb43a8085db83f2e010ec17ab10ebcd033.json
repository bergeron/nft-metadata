    "description": "\"Christmas is not as much about opening our presents as opening our hearts.\"\n\nThrough these portraits, I explore what it means to be human. To appreciate beauty, even in the midst of chaos. To show strength in the face of adversity. And to acknowledge and accept your darkness, as it will teach you to be your most authentic self. I hope youâ€™ll appreciate the beauty and the chaos in these pieces too ðŸ–¤\n\nAs a special gift to my collectors, each girl will come with her own fortune. Kinda like a fortune cookie, but without the cookie ðŸ¤“",
