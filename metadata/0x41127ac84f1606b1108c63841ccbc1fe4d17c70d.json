    "name": "Tired",
    "description": "\"Tired\" got its title because I was falling asleep when I first started it and that's what I ended up naming it while saving my work half asleep.\n\n It's actually quite the opposite of tired. It's full of energy and life which is the main reason behind why I kept the title. I like the juxtaposition of the title \"tired\" and the life it embodies. This painting is a true depiction of my learning process using the program Krita. I'm still learning how to navigate layers successfully as well as some brushes. \"Tired\" is a special painting because it marks the beginning of my exploration and skill gain in digital art. Now, let's grow together.",
