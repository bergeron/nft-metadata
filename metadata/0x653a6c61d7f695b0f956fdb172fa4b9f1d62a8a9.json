    "description": "The human condition is a nervous one. Some days im up at 3 am  trying to make sense of life. All the ups and downs, the tears of joy, tears of pain, gains and losses we go through as human beings. Lately I've been thinking about how much of our life is out of our control. We have an illusion of freedom. Past experiences, societal expectations, anxiety and so much more feel like the invisible strings that control our actions. This piece is my view of the human condition..a puppet in turmoil. When we give power to these things we feel helpless and hopeless. We make these factors our masters putting them on a pedestal.",
