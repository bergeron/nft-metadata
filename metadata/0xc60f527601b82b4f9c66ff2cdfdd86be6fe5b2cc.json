    "description": "A photo of my beloved cat, Squirt, up in her favorite tree. The lone crabapple in my front yard, beyond the woods. Squirt was a special lil kitty. She loved to talk, play, and go on adventures with me during the spring and summer. This tree in particular, was one she'd ALWAYS want to climb whenever we'd go on our morning walks together. In the months of March and April, this tree blossoms into a gorgeous array of pink blooms and orange leaves. I shot this photo during that time, with her as my main subject. At the time, I enjoyed using lots of vintage lenses on my mirrorless camera. I shot this one with a Vivtar 75-205 zoom I had gotten for $15.\nSquirt sadly disappeared the summer following this photo being taken. I was beyond heartbroken, and still am. But that is one of the main reasons why I wanted to mint this photo. No matter what, I want her spirit to live on forever, and with the blockchain, I believe that is truly possible â™¡",
