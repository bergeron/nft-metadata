    "description": "\"Girl With Apple\" is part of a personal reflection on the plant kingdom and the relationship we have with it, materially and spiritually. Although common, the apple is also extremely symbolic as it is believed to represent the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, both knowledge and farewell to innocence. In this image, I wanted to represent this passage in a positive way, to show a woman not subject to a tyrannical God but in charge of her own destiny.",
