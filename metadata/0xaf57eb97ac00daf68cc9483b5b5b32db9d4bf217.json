    "description": "The \"KASANE\" series incorporates the traditional Japanese color scheme of \"kasane-no-irome\" in which aristocrats of the Heian period expressed the four seasons by layering various colors of clothing on top of each other.\nThe first product is \"suou-no-nioi\"\nSuou no nioi is a gradation of light suho, suho, dark suho, and blue (green), a color scheme used for celebratory occasions throughout the four seasons.\n\nThe V-shaped mid-cut provides both ankle hold and ease of movement.\nTri-colored sole and white stitching in key areas add accents.\nSince the overall color scheme is flashy, we dared to use Hidden Knot for the laces to make them look simple and smart.\nThe different material mix incorporating leather and suede gives the design a playful feel.\n",
