    "name": "3D Ancient Greek Theatre of Cassope",
    "description": "The ancient theatre of Cassope is built in the southern foothills of Zaloggo and overlooks the peninsula of Preveza, the Ambracian Gulf, the Ionian Sea, the island of Lefkada and the Acarnanian mountains.\n\nIt was originally built in the 3rd BCE. Two polygonal retaining walls, reinforced with buttresses, support the two ends of the koilon, which is separated by an intervening diazoma into two main seating zones, the lower one consisting of twenty-four rows of stone seats and the upper one of twelve rows.\n\nAt the top of the auditorium, a wider walkway is protected by an outer wall that has an opening, possibly facilitating the exit of spectators from the upper part of the theatre.\n\nEleven stairways divide the theatre into ten kerkides, the ones at the two edges having half the width of the others.\n\nThe orchestra of the theatre, is unique, since it does not form a full circle, but an arc greater than a semicircle.\n\nThe theatre would have had a seating capacity of  6,000 people.",
