    "description": "My creative style is called “Polysketch”. \nWith \"Vortex\" I wanted to represent the birth of a work with this style. Polysketch recalls the concept of \"sketching polygons\", and aims to give life to artworks that have a strong dynamic sense, where pictorial style and digital sculpture blend with harmony. Vortex is a metaphor that represents my artistic journey. A vortex of simple and abstract brushstrokes merge to create a dynamic and defined image. The symbolic chaos of a vortex that has its own natural order. \n\nA swirling creative process is what every artist goes through. Therefore “Vortex” represents evolution from static to dynamism, from abstract to concrete.",
