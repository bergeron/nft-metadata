    "description": "The best portraits tell a little about photographer, not just the person you're shooting. I've been in search of the “perfect portrait” for many years. For a portrait photographer this is not easy, it means long hours, days, years even kilometers.\n \nI saw hope, sadness, hardness, intimacy, sincerity, wisdom on people’s faces but sometimes embarrassment while I was wandering in the streets around the world. In photograph, it is difficult to reflect the essence of what you see, but there is always much more that is felt. I tried to convey many special faces that my path crossed in my photographs. In this collection, I gathered most impressive child faces which I came across while I was searching for the perfect portraits\n\nPhotographed in Mumbai/2016\n\nExtended Editorial: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
