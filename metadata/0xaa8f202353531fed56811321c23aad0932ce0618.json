    "description": "Deep in my core lies a spark to paint all things with the brush that is hidden miles beneath the earths surface. I see a vast landscape of green stones and crystals calling out to me. They wish to grow along my shapes, twisting and fracturing as they form a new fortress of exploration for me to share with my skater homies. "
