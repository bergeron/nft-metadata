    "description": "Much have been said about the Muse, but not the Resistance. \n\nThe nemesis of the Muse, the Resistance is the voice that tells you to check your social feed, catch up on that television series, watch the news, anything but to do what’s really important - make art.\n\nThis piece of art serves as a daily reminder that the Resistance exists, with a smiling face, that would do or say anything to lure you away from your true destiny.\n\nFight the Resistance.\n\n---\n\n3200 x 3200. 100% made with code in p5.js\n\n---\n\nCredit: This piece is inspired by the following:\n\n- Ronald Ong’s “I Felt Numb Already”\n- All of Tim Maxwell’s line art\n- Steven Pressfield’s The War of Art",
