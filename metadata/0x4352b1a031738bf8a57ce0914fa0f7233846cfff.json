    "description": "Little Red Riding Hood grew up over the years And now she is living alone in a house far from the villagers  in a cozy place and she spends time with her friend Golden Owl. On a foggy day, she found an old book with a leather cover under an old tree near her house. When she was removing the soil to plant medicinal herbs She understood that its a magic book full of secrets and spells  of power. She was very surprised Because she could use these powers from now on to remove all the evil and filth from her world and she understood  that  the main and very difficult path of her destiny had just begun.",
