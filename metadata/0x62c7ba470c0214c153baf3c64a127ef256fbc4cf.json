    "description": "Introducing the fifth hedSOLO artist, Rohaan. A staple in the UK bass scene who's garnered support from heavy hitters like Noisia and Zeds Dead, Rohaan has carved out his own lane in a chaotic underground scene. He's been highly regarded for his innovative sound design and distinctive musical voice, which features both aggressive, high-energy rhythms and more ambient, atmospheric textures. Ahead of his US Tour, we've been blessed with the first Drum and Bass track he ever created. Here's a quote from Rohaan about the song... \n\n\"As this was the first ever DnB track that I ever produced, 'I Want You' holds a very special place in my discography and music career. You will be the first to hear it in its entirety! \n\nThis was created when I switched from FL studio to Ableton and was exploring new sonic territory.\n\nI adore the world this song paints when I hear it, it seems hopeful and wrapped in nostalgia.\n\nI hope this track can mean something to you also.\n\nR. xx \"\n\nLook forward to more hedSOLO drops every month via the heds community, exclusively on Sound.\n",
