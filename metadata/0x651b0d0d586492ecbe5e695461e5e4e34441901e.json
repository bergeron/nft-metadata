    "description": "Unique 4400 x 2750 pixel snapshot by my first generative engine created in 2007. This piece ran on march 13th 2023 around 8pm.\nGenerative timestamp 2023-03-13_20.07.57.\n\nThe animation engine in action: https://youtu.be/iR8Ko0vNS5k \n\nI wrote the first version of this code with pen and paper at a beach in Italy. I was too bored to just sit in the sun or read a book. Back in the office it took just a little bit of debugging and the „Pegasus“ engine was born. It soon came to life in realtime art installations, high resolution snapshot prints, books and articles on generative art. From Europe to the US and Japan.\n\nI also love to add my favorite „Trust us - we are scientists“ tagline to the artworks. When I started my design office back in the days we printed very special business cards with our logo printed with a silver scratch-off ink on the back. People who realized you could scratch the back uncovered the slogan.\nThe controversy on faith in science is something to think about.",
