    "description": "Say YES - To Virtual Totem Skull Sculptures\nA Series of 1/1 original 3d / Augmented Reality Artworks by Oli Goldsmith.  Extrapolating from my SKUs series of original SKULL artworks and bringing them into 3d.  A raw and often hand-drawn aesthetic is purposefully integrated into the feel of the series as a counterpoint to the 'super-clean' look common in many 3d works.   As always I like to bridge the organic and digital.",
