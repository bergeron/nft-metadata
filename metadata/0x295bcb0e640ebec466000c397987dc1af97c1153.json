Silka creates a captivating visual for her latest music.\n\nGhost was a download I received while visiting Gold Coast Ghana, and traveling through the \"Door of no Return.\" The feelings conjured up were of great gratitude for my ancestors. I am on this earth to reclaim all that was taken, and return  through the \"Door if no Return\" a liberated African. ",
