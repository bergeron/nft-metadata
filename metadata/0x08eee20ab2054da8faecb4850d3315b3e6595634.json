Don't let someone else put a limit on your thoughts, because anything you want to achieve is possible if you want it enough. \n\nDelve into the mysteries of the universe. Let your heart guide you to where you want to be. Life is short, never stop searching, working hard for what you believe in and achieving your goals. \n\nYour dreams are yours and yours alone. \n",
