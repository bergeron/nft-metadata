    "description": "Relics is a piece for solo piano and the first track that I composed for my album Ex Voto. I wanted the music of Relics to sound familiar and to evoke memories of the past. It speaks to the objects and images that we carry with us through life and conjures up nostalgia. \n\nThis is my very first music video. I wanted to bring Relics to life and invite the listener to reminisce with me.\n\n\nDirector: Grant Claire, GOODNICETHANKS\n\nMusic composed and performed by Cristina Spinei\nRecorded at Creative Workshop, Nashville, TN.",
