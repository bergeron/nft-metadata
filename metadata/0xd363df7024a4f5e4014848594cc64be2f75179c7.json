    "description": "Composition - 01\n\nThe forest bloomed with light. The crows scattered with the wind as their home swept with the brilliant hue of the nighttime. It was only when the flora shimmered in light, its brilliant fluorescence bathing the world in iambic shine that the crows found reasons to feel alive. Night was their collective muse, a time and space when a classical sense of beauty whispered directly into their avian brains, acknowledging that if there was ever a point to existence, it was to witness the gleam of the plankton, and to get lost with the shimmer of a universe that was made just for them.\n\n\nDimension : 7000x5000 px",
