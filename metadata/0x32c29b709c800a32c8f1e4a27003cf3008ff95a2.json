    "description": "This aerial photograph is the first in the C-R-E-A-T-E collection and marks the beginning of this collection.\nThis country house of the 19th century and its architecture from above is a visualization of the letter C.\n\nVisualisation:\nThe ะก-R-E-A-T-E collection will include 7 1/1 unique works, where each photo will show 1 letter from the word ะก-R-E-A-T-E and 1 work will include the whole word together. Each letter of the word C-R-E-A-T-E will be shown in the form of buildings, nature, urban architecture.\n\nIdea:\nThe C-R-E-A-T-E collection has its mission to show artists, photographers and ordinary people that sometimes it is enough to be sensitive to the reality around us to create something new and creative. Observation is part of our ability to create. And through sincere curiosity, observation and openness to the new, we can create.\n\nResolution: \n4990x3413\n\nYear: \n2021\n",
