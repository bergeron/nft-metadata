    "description": "Daises under the Moon is a song i wrote in a countryside in Moscow, Russia in the summer of June this year when i was walking with my wife picking daisies for my mother in law in the wild forest. I walked and came back to the wooden countryside home we were staying in, picked up a guitar and started writing that song... my step dad-in-law was chilling there and my wife too, i distinctly remember. \n\nIt's also a song of hope as i narrate, in my native tongue in the bridge-ish portion, imagining myself to be a bird flying in the night sky looking for something, and being reminded somehow, that i belong to the earth not the skies. \n\nThe artwork is a beautiful piece made by my friend @KathedralNFT.\n\nSong written, music composed, mixed, mastered by myself, krp. \n\nUtility... hmm well for one the music is the utility folks! Apart from that:\n\n1. Feel free to hit me up for a 1-1 call\n2. Mixing, production, mastering chat\n3. Id love to play flute on one of your tracks, just hit me up :)\n4. If ever you are in India, id love to take you to one of the temples here! We have a rich heritage of beautiful temples. \n5. Stems to the song on demand, feel free to use them as samples or anything!\n",
