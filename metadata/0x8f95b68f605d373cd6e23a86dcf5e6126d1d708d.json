    "description": "Fran  Rodríguez  aka  lacabezaenlasnubes  (spanish  for  \"head  in  the  clouds\")  is  a  digital  artist  based  in  Tarragona,  Spain.  He  is  famously  known  for  his  striking  images  depicting  his  interpretation  of  humanity’s  place  in  the  universe.  Fran’s  work  is  deeply  inspired  by  his  early  fondness  of  surrealism  and  psychedelia.  In  his  20  year  career,  he  has  worked  with  bands  such  as  Weezer,  Tame  Impala  and  Twin  Shadow  creating  visual  elements  for  their  concerts  and  albums.",
