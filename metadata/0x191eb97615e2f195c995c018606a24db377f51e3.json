    "description": "# Background: Earth Element Rock\nJust as a rock provides a protective shelter, awakening the Root Chakra will help you feel protected and safe, allowing you to let go of fear and anxiety and fully embrace life.\n\n# Halo: Power To Aquire Needs\nYou have the power to develop a mindset of abundance. You will believe that you have everything you need to succeed.\n\n# Color: Red\nMy red color empowers you with passion and devotion. You will stay focused on your spiritual path and will discover a deep love and devotion for the Divine that will cultivate a strong willpower and discipline.\n\n# Adornment: Necklace of Love\nI adorn you with the quality of self-compassion, to be kind and gentle with yourself, and to treat yourself with the same Love and care that you would offer to a dear friend.\n\n# Arms: Prayer Hands & Gada\nBy holding my gada while offering prayer, I remind you to combine strength and devotion in all that you do. Your inner strength will be harnessed with devotion to a higher power, just as I wield the powerful gada while remaining devoted to Lord Rama.\n\n\n\n# Crown: Crown of Bliss\nLaugh often and don't take life too seriously, for this crown of Bliss brings the quality of finding humor and lightness in every moment.",
