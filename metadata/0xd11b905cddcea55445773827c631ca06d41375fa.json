    "name": "THE TRIDEV ENGINE",
    "description": "Year 2956, the age of machines, where the legends of the past have been recreated as living weapons of war. Lately there have been reports of unusual happenings on the surface world. A tensed Prof Naarang hurriedly makes his way through a portal that opens into a massive space situated in the earths very core, called the \"Daivik Chamber\" .  The professor steps on a holographic platform that takes him to the being that presides over this space, A gigantic three headed AI titan that powers the earth like a literal engine. According to Legends , this core possesses the essence of the legendary Trideva( Brahma vishnu and mahesh) and with it, contains centuries worth of knowledge. Each head has a specific task that it accomplishes ( Generator Operator and destroyer) and the gems that power the cyber warriors on the surface world were said to be a fragment of this core. \"Greetings , professor\" says the titan in a booming voice as the tensed professor proceeds to share the message.",
