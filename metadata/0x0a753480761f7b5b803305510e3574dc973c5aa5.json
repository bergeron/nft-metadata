Powers and phenomenons that are hidden to the naked eye and which reveal themselves to only those willing to delve deep and pay attention. \n\nThere is more to the metaverse than the visible strings of numbers and lines of codes. Much as the human mind, it is something bigger than the sum of its parts. What it is exactly is yet to be unveiled and for us to be discovered.",
