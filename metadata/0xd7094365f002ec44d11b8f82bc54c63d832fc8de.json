    "description": "Stones and Skulls is a physical NFT collection. Hand painted We use the highest quality acrylic paints to paint our marble pebbles. Each pebble is 3D scanned and transformed into a unique digital art piece. The physical art piece can be claimed after a wallet holding time of 6 weeks. The owner needs to pay for sending and art insurance. Or you remain it in our safe storage - for free. \n\nThe collection includes a variety of designs, from skulls, objects and skeletons to abstract patterns and landscapes. Each piece is one-of-a-kind and can never be replicated.\n\nThe digital art pieces are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and can be traded, sold, or gifted just like any other NFT.",
