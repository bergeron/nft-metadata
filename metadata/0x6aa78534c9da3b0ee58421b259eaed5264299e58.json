    "description": "Little Sally Urkheimer wanted so badly to start a business. So, she walked down from her parent's quaint little seaside cottage to the clean white sands of her backyard and began picking up seashells to sell by the sea. Now, all little Sally has to do is wait for her first customer to arrive and survey her splendid sum of seashells, while she tries to fight off a pickpocketing crab.",
