    "description": "This Block Quest PassKey allows entry to the token gated \"Area 23\" of Flagship\n\nAdd this NFT in your wallet connected to your Spatial.io account.\n\nEnter Flagship Area-23 at this link  \nhttps://www.spatial.io/s/FLAGSHIP-Area-23-63703ba4e051b600011c6826?share=2150419419978192999\n\nThe first clue is right in front of you. What a GEM! Something of this nature can only be from the Biess Galaxy in the outer rim of Flagship floor levels. This gem is known as the \"threeINAkind\" Diamonde and was one of two sisters discovered in the  Geffuktogon Mountains. Her sister was listed on the market and holds a wealth of knowledge in it's detail. Definitely worth taking a look. \n\nThe location of PassKey#4 may be buried deep in the core of the gem's history. Then again, it might be another missing piece to collect in order to complete this quest. \n\nRemember, the only transactions required to complete \"The Elements\" quest are the Block Quest PassKeys.   \n\nGood Luck.  \netherstu",
