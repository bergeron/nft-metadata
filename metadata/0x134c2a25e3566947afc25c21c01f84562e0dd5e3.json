This mushroom is the result of the cross-breeding of two original one of a kind generative mushrooms donated back to the Fisherian Runaways project by their generous owner. A sibling variation of this crossbreed can be found on the TEZ blockchain (created by zawada.tez / tz1PmBx9EHvsN6fWJhS3zuUzPp8j7jWw4Fd8) and was gifted to the donor of the original mushrooms and proceeds from sales of this piece will be shared with the mushroom donor.",
