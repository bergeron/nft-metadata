    "description": "A hornless ocean dragon, sometimes equated with a sea serpent. Wyrm literally means, \"Great Lizard\". The legend of the wyrm says that the sun god gave the Wyrm their power through a human girl, which would be transformed into the Wyrm on her 17th birthday. Legend also said that a dragon-shaped mark would be found on the shoulder of the girl, revealing that she was the Wyrm in human form.",
