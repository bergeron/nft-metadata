Is this reality? Does true permanence exist or is it all simply an illusion?\n\n*Illusion of Permanence* is a collection of 1/1 photo NFTs that seeks to capture the creeping impermanence and slow decay of man-made objects through the lens of black and white photography. While many of the objects themselves are yet to fall into disrepair, their future destruction is foretold in the light, shadow, grit, and grain of the images - artificial permanence eroded by a waterfall of grey tones.\n",
