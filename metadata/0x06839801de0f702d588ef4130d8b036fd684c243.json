    "description": "A solitary shadow, lost in thought, slipping away. The solace of his introspection despite the rush.\n\nFrom the colorful advertisements and graffiti that flash by to the quiet moments of reflection and contemplation, 'Metro Connexion' documents the many moods and atmospheres of a city subway. The rhythmic roar of the trains and the echoing footsteps of a lone passenger are just a few examples of the daily commute. A journey that encompasses the hustle and bustle of city life, as well as the moments of solitude, waiting and stress that are an inevitable part of the experience.\n\n5100 x 3400\nFormat PNG",
