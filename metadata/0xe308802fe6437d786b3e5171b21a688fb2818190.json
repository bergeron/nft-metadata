    "description": "The elements that appear frequently in Hwang Ji-hyun's work are plants and houses. In other words, it is a transformed nature and a house in it, and the house in the work is a space of rest and the desire to escape. It is a space located in the middle where opposing desires collide. At the same time, it also pinches the reality that it is difficult to obtain a place of rest. Here, the artist's personal desire to be healed and the desire for a being who tells where to go are melted together. \n\n#NFTart  #physical-based",
