    "description": "Deeply rooted in absurdism, this work explores the philosophical idea that human existence is intertwined in a purposeless and chaotic universe of utter randomness. \n\nThe uncanny image can be seen as a passage of escape from the constraints of our own reality, allowing viewers to become engrossed in a dubious world of the absurd. \nWhen we are confronted by a place in which the boundaries of our tangible world are shattered, the impossible is left to become a daily occurrence.  \n\nKatie Morris is a Scottish artist based in Glasgow, UK. In a human-machine collaboration, she offers stolen glimpses into a parallel world bizarrely like our own.\nHer post photographic imagery often sees chaotic, yet whimsical and surreal renditions of reality explored. In these works, she conveys a sense of disorder that characterises our presence, while also highlighting the fragility and ambiguity of life. \n\n",
