    "description": "\"Every morning she'd cradle her coffee from the local diner to the empty pool nearby. There was no one around this early, so she considered this spot hers. The place always reminded her of that 1990s movie where some mythical guy floated out of a yellow pool, electrified. Imagine that happening here. A magical pool portal. Water rolling in, growing the weeds, after years of neglect. Like a psychedelic garden.\"\n\nThis drawing is one in a series based on my visit to the Southwest region of the USA. I find the landscape fascinating, nature as well as cityscapes. My drawings are influenced by movies and TV - making use of camera-like angles to tell a story and to set a particular atmosphere.",
