    "description": "She loved to fly in the clouds. Every time she closed her eyes, she was transported to a beautiful World. A world where there were several moons in the sky. A world where everyone was happy. A world where there were no resentments and envy. A world where there were no wars and no knowledge of pain. A perfect World.

Her name was Avril.",
