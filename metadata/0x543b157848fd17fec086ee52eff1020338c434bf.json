And as the city works to modernize the tracks, I choose to document the aged magnificence of these dilapidated stations.\n\nChicago || 2020 || PhilJones.eth\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
