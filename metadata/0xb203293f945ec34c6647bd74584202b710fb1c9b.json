The Motel sign seeped into anything around us”\n_______________________________________\nAbout The Project:\n\n4000km, in the extreme West of the United States of America, traveled \"on the road\".\nThe importance of moving with the body, but above all with the mind, guides me to the freedom of expression through photography, today an essential tool of my daily life.\nThe search for light gives me an unstoppable desire to compose and document what my eyes see through my camera, which becomes a window into the present of a new and engaging reality.",
