DayGlo pencils and spray paints were utilized to create 21 physical canvas artworks. The artworks were digitalized, delicately curated, and matched to a custom smart contract with unique metadata; each piece was then minted as a 1 of 1 ERC721 Non-Fungible Token. The first owner of each NFT also owns the physical canvas. The shipping of the physical canvas to the buyer is facilitated by PottersNFT Corporation claim via electronic mail : operations@pottersnft.io.\n\n\nðŸŽ¨ Artist: Mr. $ ðŸŽ¨\n\nSmart Contract Author: PottersNFT Corporation (https://pottersnft.io)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PottersNFTCORP\n ",
