    "description": "This chapter testifies to our love of sand dunes. Being there at night is indeed a unique experience to live. Majestic and mysterious, vast and maybe hostile at first glance, they give us a unique perspective, a sense of power and smallness at the same time. The feeling of being alone is amplified by the fact that we are surrounded by an infinity of sand in every direction. Although it can be intimidating, being in these sand territories ignites some sense of euphoria, adventure, and freedom within us. Every desert can become a giant sandbox to explore and express our creativity.  For us, the desert is one of those locations where we feel the need to go back. Sort of anchor points allowing us to see the progression we made over the years.\n\nIn the desert, the wind leaves its trace, drawing sinuous lines and ripples in the sand. An ephemeral piece of art for us to capture. The moon, just like the wind, played an important role in the creation of this picture, adding a dramatic aspect to this moment by piercing through to the cloudy sky. We canâ€™t see her but can indeed feel its presence.",
