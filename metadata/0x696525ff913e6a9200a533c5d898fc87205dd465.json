    "description": "Let me please look into my window on 103rd Street one more timeâ€”\nwithout crying, without tearing the satin, without touching\nthe white face, without straightening the tie or crumpling the flower.\n\nLet me walk up Broadway past Zak's, past the Melody Fruit Store,\npast Stein's Eyes, past the New Moon Inn, past the Olympia.\n\nLet me leave quietly by Gate 29\n\nand fall asleep as we pull away from the ramp\ninto the tunnel.\n\nLet me wake up happy, let me know where I am, let me lie still,\nas we turn left, as we cross the water, as we leave the light.\n\nG. Stern",
