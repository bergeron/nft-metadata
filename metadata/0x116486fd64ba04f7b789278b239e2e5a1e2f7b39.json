    "description": "The Red Pill is the first-ever Web3 entrance into the Eidverse, an open-ended and community-centered metaverse rooted in Web3 onboarding, education, and growth. It also serves as a path towards ownership, access, and rewards across the Eidverse ecosystem. The Eidverse founding community embraces values such as mutual support and celebration with an emphasis on welcoming members new to Web3 from the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. For many, the Red Pill will be their very first Web3 experience. This freshness of perspective underpins the potential of the Eidverse to reimagine Web3 possibilities. Everyone is welcome to share in this promise.",
