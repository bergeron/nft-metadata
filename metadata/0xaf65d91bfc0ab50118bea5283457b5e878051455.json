    "description": "This year, just when the cherry blossoms in Tokyo were in full bloom, heavy rain fell and scattered them.\nHowever, the ground was filled with cherry petals, which created a beautiful sight.\nIt is a rare sight that can only be seen if it rains timely.\nThis is one of my favorite pictures of cherry blossoms taken this year.",
