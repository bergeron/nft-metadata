    "description": "“David Blaine” is the debut of my singing era. With seven years of vocal lessons under my belt, I've written countless songs and “David Blaine” has stood out to my community as a golden single that everyone can relate to. I wrote this song when I was faced with mounting bills and the woes of modern day life. My relationship with the love of my life was the one thing that could lift me up and take me to a happier reality. I hope this will be a magical beginning to my upcoming singles and albums that incorporate the same joy and passion within “David Blaine.” ",
