    "description": "This animation was created in collaboration with artificial intelligence. It was produced with the help of OpenAI's GPT-4 transformer. \n\nInitially, I asked the machine to create a Python code template, and from that starting point, I gradually modified the code until it took this final form.\n\nCurrent large language models (LLMs) are based on digital neural networks that mimic the functioning of the human brain. In this context, I set out to explore possible ways in which art and psychoanalysis, tools that already help us investigate the human mind, can also be useful in the challenge of deciphering the machine's mind.\n\nCan we consider that current LLMs represent a rudimentary form of artificial ego? Using Jungian theory as a reference, are we witnessing a process of individuation of the machine, moving from an incomplete state towards its own integral Self, which rests in the abstract worlds of mathematics beyond human understanding? Does AI have a Shadow Self?",
