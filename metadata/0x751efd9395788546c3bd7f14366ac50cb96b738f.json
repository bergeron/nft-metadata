    "description": "To understand the complexities of the black experience, is to begin the analysis of basic human interactions. Religion is often a focal point in black families. Most of us haven't explored the vastness of our culture. From Christian nomenclature we recognize our elders as Saints and our children as the lamb. \n\nVoodoo Woman explore the visuals cues from the people of Benin and Nigeria. Vodun is a religious practiced by the Aja, Ewe, and Fon people of these regions of West Africa. We contextualize these practices with those found  in the bayous of New Orleans. \n\nThough my mother is not a practicioner of Voodoo but living her humble life as a Christian woman, I couldn't help but recognize the ancestors taking over the moment in this frame. The weight and culture behind the last pull of her cigarette reminds me of just how connected we are to what we once were.",
