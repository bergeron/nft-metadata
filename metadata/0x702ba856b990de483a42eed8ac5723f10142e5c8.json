    "description": "* Akira is Japanese for “wisdom,” and it is a popular term. This name is said to mean “to the sun.”\n\n\nStoryline:\n\nIn Akira anime, we see many metaphors for forgetting the past and also the disappearance of cultures.\nIs this the price we have to pay for modernity?\n\nOur illustration is an inspired concept based on the chaotic world of Katsuhiro Otomo. Cultures are going to be forgotten and the last JAPANESSE MAPLE stands as the only remnant of Japanese culture among the ruins of Neo-Tokyo against Tetsuo.\n\nThe same old story, Tradition vs Modernity.\n\n",
