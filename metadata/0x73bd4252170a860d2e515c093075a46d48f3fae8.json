    "description": "Throughout the universe, if there is life, there must be happiness and joy, as well as in the garden of Chroniza.\nThe five true friends who used to be filled with color every second turned into tears and regret because Joy had disappeared, swallowed up by the darkness that came from another dimension.\nJack tries every day to open another dimension based on a high curiosity that brings disaster, but they don't blame anyone for what happened because what Jack did was a mutual agreement and was approved by all of them.\n\nThey will try experiments to multiply themselves to increase the strength by up to 6000 (1500 tokens per character), and then they will look for the center point of another dimension to try to defeat it.\nMore than 500 traits of each character will make each of them very unique and colorful and have different special powers.\nThey will try hard to bring Joy back and gather together, joining them in a boundless adventure.",
