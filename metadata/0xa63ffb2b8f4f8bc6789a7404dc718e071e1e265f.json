    "description": "It is the late 23rd century and the galaxy is at peace. The United Federation of Planets has thrived under the leadership of Captain Jean-Luc Picard for many years. However, a new danger threatens to destroy all that they have built.\n\nA mysterious artist known only as \"the paper cutter\" has created a stunning work of art depicting Captain Picard in his iconic black uniform. The detail and intricacy of the piece are breathtaking, but there is something sinister about it too. It seems almost...ominous.\n\nSome believe that the paper cutter's work is a warning, an omen of things to come. They say that the golden ratio which appears throughout the painting is a sign of bad luck and destruction. No one knows for sure what the paper cutter's true intentions are, but everyone agrees that his art is utterly mesmerizing and spine chilling at the same time.",
