    "description": "Urban Saints has been a part of my life for over 10 years.\n\nUrban Saints was the first piece of personal artistic expression that I ever pursued in my life.  \n\nUrban Saints is the reason I am still doing what I do today and I am fortunate to be able to do it for a living.\n\nUrban Saints has helped me to be touched by countless incredible people.\n\nUrban Saints has taught me to cherish each and every existing, new and future connection. \n\nUrban Saints has helped me visit places, that I wouldn't have been able to visit otherwise. \n\nUrban Saints has taught me to see beauty in everything.\n\nUrban Saints has reminded me to never take anything for granted.\n\nUrban Saints has made me appreciate life that much more in general.\n\nI am not minting photos.\n\nI am immortalising a significant part of myself.\n\nAs a person, as a professional, and as an artist.\n\nThank you!
