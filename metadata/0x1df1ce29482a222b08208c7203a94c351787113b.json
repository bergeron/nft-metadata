    "name": "In the Deepest Blue",
    "description": "In April of 2020, I began tinkering with a single image of the moon and a small group of rocks in photoshop. For me, diving into a project like this is often an adventure of its own, thereâ€™s unexpected turns, failures, elation, and everything in between. \n\nA few months after my initial edits, I took a trip through central Oregon with one of my best friends and his dog Coda. She had been diagnosed with cancer around a month prior, and this was sadly her last trip with us. I found the tree you see in this piece on the last full day of her life, standing gracefully alone in an endless field of green pastures.\n\nThe mountain comes from one of the hardest backpacking trips of my life in Alaska, which made its way into the image later that year, and then clouds from the Oregon coast, and stars I captured in the desert. In the end, each layer of this came from a point in my life full of hardship, but the process of creating this helped me escape, it was my peace in the deepest blue. ",
