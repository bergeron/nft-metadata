    "description": "Resolution: 8256x6605\nUnique 1/1 NFT edition\n\nThe heart-shaped road in Špičnik, Slovenia, located in the middle of vineyards, is known for its unique shape and romantic atmosphere.\n\nIt's a blend of 55 photos from the best shots of different times of day: from the warm glow of sunset to the darkness of night with light trails from cars and star trails, then the cool tones of the morning blue hour with fog, and finally the beauty of sunrise.\n\nFun fact: The road's heart shape was not intentional. The locals had simply wanted to eliminate a steep slope by adding an extra curve to the road, resulting in its unique shape.",
