    "description": "In the innocence of childhood and the pre-occupation and nervousness of starting\nschool, I was unaware I had sight issues until I\nencountered difficulties in seeing the blackboard.\nSitting close to the television should have\nbeen some sign of a problem, but maybe this was just seen as enthusiasm for what I was watching.\n\nLike many other health conditions, there are\nnumerous ways in which our sight can be affected\nand unless we are fortunate to have perfect sight, we all see the world very differently.\n\nFrom pages 6/7 of book 'Myopic Visions'. Each NFT purchase in this collection will also receive (if required) a signed copy of the book. \n",
