    "description": "**THE CREATIVE MIND OF A BEATLE: “CRASH #2/4” NFT AND RINGO STARR SIGNED PRINT** \n\nAn iconic, original self-portrait, created by Starr during his early years as a Beatle, animated and brought to life in a sonic big bang of cymbal crashes and color. This exclusive NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a 2 of 4 Edition. The item is dynamically interpreted in an even more personal way through an exclusive custom-made drum composition recorded and played by Starr. His legendary drumming style strikes to the beat of the moving digital painting which is minted as part of this NFT. An NFT is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on the blockchain. \n\nCrash #2/4 NFT is accompanied by a 25” x 25” canvas print signed by the iconic musician/author/philanthropist/painter with ownership of the NFT, granting access to join Starr on an exclusive virtual tour of the groundbreaking digital gallery experience, RingoLand. All of the winning bidders can join Starr in this virtual hangout created by Spatial. \n\nA portion of the sale proceeds from this NFT will be donated to The Lotus Foundation. \n\nBLOCKCHAIN Ethereum",
