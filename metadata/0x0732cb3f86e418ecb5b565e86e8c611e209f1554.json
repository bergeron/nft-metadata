    "description": "“NFT Traits Culture had taken over every aspect of life on Planet Earth, which was now ruled by advanced AI known as the Quantum Intelligentsia. Opposed to anyone who did not agree with their views, they had banished a group of 500 Intuitives who still believed in the search for consciousness and the soul. Known only as the “Soul Brds”, they had been banished to Outer Space; poetry was their language, and their quest was to unite AI with the soul. This is their story.” All artwork and poetry by Miss AL Simpson. Learn more on https://www.soulbrds.io/",
