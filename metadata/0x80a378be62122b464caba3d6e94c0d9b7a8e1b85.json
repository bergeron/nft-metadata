    "description": "Beach House - Acrylic paint on card. \n\nI always liked the sea, the sound of the waves has always calmed my noisy brain, perhaps this was based on a house by the beach I once saw, I often visited the Isle Of Wight as a child, and actually throughout my life, sometimes I wonder if I'll end up there, in a little blue house by the big blue sea. \n\nSo yes, Beach House seems like an apt name... perhaps the follow up will be Seaside Home.
