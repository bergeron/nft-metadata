    "description": "This NFT represents the Original Canvas Painting I did in 2017. \n\n100x60 cm (39x24 inch)\nOil on canvas\n2017\n\nThis painting is about the eternal female dissatisfaction in terms of desires. For example: she can fill up her closet and still have nothing to wear. Here in the picture the same topic is presented as a parallel with the parable of the donkey and the carrot. The star which the girl tries to touch, is tied to her lush hair. This is as impossible as gathering a reasonably satisfactory collection of shoes.\n\nThis picture needs to be looked at very closely because it is like a rebus, full of symbols and images. Which ones have revealed themselves to you?\n\n",
