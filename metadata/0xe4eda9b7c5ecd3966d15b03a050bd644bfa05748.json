Cherishing art, hustling, and believing in this space more than ever! \n\nMy first mint happened a year ago ‚ÄúQuarantine Cravings‚Äù on Wazirx. I came into this space to explore and learn but ended up making a beautiful family here. \n\nThere is a lot to celebrate. It's been one crazy year. I wanted to take the time to thank you. I am so grateful for the things I learned from you. Gratitude for your kind soul, for hustling to express themselves while motivating others to do the same. Hugs and love to you!\n\nI have plans and ideas that I want to develop while building you up. Thank you very much for being a part of my journey, believing in my work and supporting me. You are a blessing and I am grateful for you ‚ù§Ô∏è",
