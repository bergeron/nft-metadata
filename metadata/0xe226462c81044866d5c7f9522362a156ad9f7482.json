    "description": "Just like a flower, which is so delicate, the fact that something so fragile, so unbearably tender could survive, let alone exist, was a miracle. Human souls are also sensitive, and our habits and stereotypes harm them. Individuals were creatures of habit, and it was amazing what they have become familiarised to. We are all children of one religion, and we are all tied through spirits, so let us welcome each other and embrace ourselves, because we are all fighting our own battles.\nThe very least we can do is not be voiceless, imagining to be unheard or silenced by anyone or anything.",
