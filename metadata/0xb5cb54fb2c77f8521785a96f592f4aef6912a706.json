    "description": "We often say “God lives within ourselves”, but with the daily hustle and bustle of life, sometimes we forget about this. Maybe festivals are made to remind us of the almighty. “Gajon”, a very different festive calls upon devotees irrespective of their age. This little boy with makeup on wants to represent a Hindu God. Maybe he is peeping in to see if others who will be joining him are ready or not, maybe his curious eyes are finding someone, or maybe they are just checking in the preparation of the festivity. The purity of his eyes shows devotion to God. Maybe God himself is checking on the festivity preparation through this little boy’s eyes.",
