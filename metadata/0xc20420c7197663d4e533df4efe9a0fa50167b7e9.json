    "description": "Part of the METAPRIDE LAND 2022 Collection\n\nAll These Faces Are Mine is one image of a photoshoot, featuring makeup by Pakistani makeup artist Iftikhar Ul Hassan. The shoot features four characters, two typically male and two typically female, but each shown as both genders. These images and the cognitive dissonance they cause calls into question our views of gender, and explores the artist's own non-binary identity. Find out more about the full shoot by visiting the artist's website at www.gillianrhodes.com",
