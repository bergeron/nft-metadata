    "description": "Heroes of Fate // [MetaHero Theme Song] Op.17 (2021)\n\n\"Even with the overview effect, its jaded us. We go back to our old ways... calamity of the mind, corruption of the heart... perhaps we can rewrite the course of history. All it takes is one glimmer of hope.\"\n\nHeroes of Fate is an original theme song for the MetaHero Universe. As an original Punkscomic minter, I really resonated with the overall universe/lore  of MetaHero & wanted to create some powerful music reflecting this grand characteristic. Lyrics contain NFT history easter-eggs & narratives that reinforce an intergalactic conflict of good vs. evil coupled with its complexities.\n\nPlease note, this was not a commission nor is there any official endorsement from PixelVault.\n\nThis is a re-engineered and remastered version of the initial release. This is the first-ever mint of this song on any blockchain. \n\nFull quality .MP3/.WAV files for both the original song and the instrumental version  are included with purchase.\n\n____  \nPurchasing this NFT includes commercial rights usage of the song recording. It does not include commercial rights to the composition.\n\nThe commercial license transfers with the token. If a previous holder uses this song in a commercial context & sells the token, commercial actions must be ceased, as the license is then revoked and transferred to the new holder. i.e. there will only ever be 1 active commercial license holder at any given time.\n\nLICENSE DETAILS: Creative Commons: CC BY  \nLEGAL CODE: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n\n_____  \nAIRTIME ROYALTIES APPLY (MINIMUM 20%)  \nSYNC LICENSING ROYALTIES APPLY (MINIMUM 20%)  \nPERFORMANCE ROYALTIES APPLY (MINIMUM 20%)\n\n_____  \nC-R-E-D-I-T-S  \nWritten & Produced by: Noxis  \nMixing & Mastering by: Noxis \nVocals: Noxis  & Willea Zwey  \nGuitars: Noxis  \nSound Design: Noxis  \n_____  \nMetaHero Universe Generative Identities Art by Chris Wahl & Odious",
