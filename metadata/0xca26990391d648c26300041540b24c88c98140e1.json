    "description": "Taken on a spur of the moment road trip to the washington coast, this photo was one I wasn't expecting to take. The day started with a few short glimpses of sunshine, but progressed to being completely cloudy by the afternoon. Nevertheless, I sat by the water and waited for the last glimmer of daylight as a handful of surfers started packing up for the night. Just after the sun set, the sky started to open up, revealing one of the most intense shades of pink I have ever seen. \n\nYou can plan for a lot of life's moments, but some of the most meaningful are those that come naturally. This photo represents the significance of those small moments.",
