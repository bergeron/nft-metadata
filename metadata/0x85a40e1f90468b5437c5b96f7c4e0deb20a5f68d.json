    "name": "Extinction of the Dinosaurs #18",
    "description": "After a 175 million year stint roaming the Earth, the Dinosaurs of the Cretaceous Period suffered a mass extinction event that wiped out most living things on the planet. There's not enough evidence to thoroughly prove the particulars of how the extinction occurred but it seems in a short time lethal environmental cataclysms took place all over the globe including a potential killer asteroid impact or severe volcanic eruptions.",
