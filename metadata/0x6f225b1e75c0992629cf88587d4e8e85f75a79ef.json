    "description": "Papel Picado is a collection inspired by a loving appreciation for Prehispanic origins of culture in Mexican folk art and decorative craft, in metaversal form.  Each chapter is a capsule, a self-contained unit to be built upon and revisited throughout time. Every piece morphs interpreting the perforation of paper, and weaves in elements reflecting color, light, pattern, and materiality. 1/1 • 2022",
