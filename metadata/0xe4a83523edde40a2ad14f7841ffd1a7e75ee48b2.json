    "description": "Cubism Canvas is an NFT collection of 500 high-quality, high-resolution artworks at a resolution of 9933 x 14043 pixels, which equates to paper size A0 printed at 300 DPI. Holders may print their work up to 1.1 metres high and enjoy the detail of every brush stroke similar to a traditional oil painting. This is a project that allows holders to own a physical artwork and an accompanying NFT as a certificate of authenticity. The art is revealed over time until the work is complete. With each iteration, the owner's artwork becomes more diverse with the final result being unique. The final version will be supplied at the full resolution, until then a lower quality version will be used. During the creation, holders are encouraged to join the project's Discord server as there will be opportunity to drive the direction of the art with special traits chosen by the community.",
