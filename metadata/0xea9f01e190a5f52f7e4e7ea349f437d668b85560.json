    "description": "Shashamane is a town located in southern Ethiopia, known for its Rastafarian community. \nIn 1948, Emperor Haile Selassie donated Ethiopian land to accommodate people from the Caribbean of African descent who wished to live there. \nHis coronation also gave rise to a new spiritual movement symbolized by his birth name, which is now practiced all over the globe. \nMany people call it Rastafarianism. \nFollowers of the movement typically call themselves Rastafari or Rasta. \nThe Rasta ideology considers Ethiopia to be Zion â€” the promised land for Black people.\nThis has made Ethiopia a sacred place for Rastafarians.\nIn 1978, Bob Marley visited the village and described it as his spiritual home.\nThis collection explores the Rastafari culture, and their veneration of the marijuana plant.\nIt was taken over the course of one month while staying with Ras Lumumba and the local community. \nThis portrait represents the essence of their culture, a beautiful and welcoming smile for all.\n",
