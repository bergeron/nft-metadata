    "description": "Combination of several notes on A3 format paper using acrylics created for future reference in making physical abstract works.  \n\nCreating solely being in the moment doesn't always work best for me as urges to make an artwork more complex appear leading me to overload it with details, which is why I try to take time to plan techniques and colors before moving onto big canvases. Making these \"acrylic notes\" allows to master the idea without the fear of it being imperfect.",
