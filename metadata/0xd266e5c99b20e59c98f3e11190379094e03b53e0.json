    "description": "\nBianca Leonor Quiñones also known as QUIN is an independent multifaceted creator and musician based in Los Angeles. QUIN began by sharing her music through a style she describes as “Fantasy Soul” -A self made genre intended to showcase the power of boundless versatility through sound. Since then, Fantasy Soul has evolved into a world full of different creative mediums, events and experiences through the imagination of QUIN. \n\n*Thinkin Bout You II is a reimagined version of my original Thinkin Bout You Soundcloud release from 2015. My songs are often an open dialogue between me and my Highest Self. This is a love letter to me, a calling home after straying away too long; a conversation about dreaming my way back to Self.  \n\n<3 Q",
