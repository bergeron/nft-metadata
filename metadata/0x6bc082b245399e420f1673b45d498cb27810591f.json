    "description": "The design of Vitalik's trading card was inspired by Carsonated's Freedom card. The background of the card is taken from the iconic 1972 Topps baseball set, which happens to be one of my personal favorites. In the image, Vitalik is depicted wearing a Pete Rose uniform, but the meaning behind the phrase \"Fake HOFer\" is left open to interpretation. It's unclear whether the term is intended as a compliment or an insult, and whether it refers to Pete Rose or Vitalik himself.",
