    "description": "A yellow field in focus with a pillar tells us about material life, it is beautiful and fascinating, it can change color from yellow wheat to purple-lavender or red poppies, but it always remains in our attention. We spend most of our lives looking at these colorful pictures of various forms of being, getting carried away and playing with meanings and actions. Time flies with barely noticeable smeared road poles that fly as smoothly as years. Our gaze is focused on multi-colored pictures in a beautiful distance, so the pillars-years are just like a technical flaw, it violates the composition of our ideas about life and time. Over all this stretched thunderclouds with a not-so-pleasant Sun. These clouds are the personification of the Universe itself, huge and incomprehensible in its scale. Life in the picture is compared to a fleeting glance of the driver, who turned his head out the window for a couple of seconds, flying along the highway to the cemetery.",
