I worked with the image to bring focus where I felt it needed it and taking away from areas that I didn’t feel it needed it. It took me over a long time to process it, with each step I made I found something new or something that needed to be improved. I’m really pleased how it came out. This is one of my favourite photographs that I have taken for over a decade.  \n\n\n**Properties** \n\n**Resolution:** 7500X5000\n\n**Shutter speed:** 4 minute 37 s \n\n**Lens Aperture:**  f/5.6  \n\n**Focal length:** 23mm \n\n**ISO:** 100 \n\n**Time of day:** Twilights\n\n**Genre:** Fine art Black & White\n\n**Technique:** Long exposure",
