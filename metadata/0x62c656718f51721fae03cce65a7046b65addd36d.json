    "description": "This NFT is unique. It is painted in oil on canvas and photographed. It was important to keep the line between vulgar and refined. The picture shows just a girl, and then our imagination draws a picture. Isn't it magical? This suggests that our consciousness is limitless.\n\nAll NFTs in this collection will reveal the theme of boundaries. Because many people on the Internet have forgotten that there are limits to what is permissible. It is important to feel this edge everywhere.",
