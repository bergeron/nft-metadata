    "description": "This version of the world famous painting \"The Scream\" by Edvard Munch was reinterpreted by Kara in June 2022. She used only the touchpad of her Macbook and Photoshop. No pen, no drawing tablet, no filters, no effects, no skills. Just a human hand on a touchpad, a virtual brush, an eraser, lots of colours and a dash of madness. This is how, in a moment of utter boredom, the first painting of the infamous \"Terrible Touchpad Paintings\" NFT collection was born. And it wasn't to be the last masterpiece.",
