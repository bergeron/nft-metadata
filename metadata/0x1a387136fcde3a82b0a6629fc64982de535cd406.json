    "description": "Today is Aug 12 2021. \n\nIt’s 10am, I’m currently sitting at a bar drunk. I just got broken up with, I never understood what heart break felt like till now. I’m heading out to Dean Street Studios in London to meet Mr. Hudson right now for our first session. \n\nWe wrote this on George Harrison’s piano, and did this song in one take. Before I had to catch a flight. I haven’t written a song in 10 months, today inspired me to write one in 10min. This song is called fourteen hours. \n\nThis is my genesis music NFT and my first release as an independent artist. ",
