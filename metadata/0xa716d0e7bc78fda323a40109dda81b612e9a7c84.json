    "description": "This technology has been hidden from the public's eyes for good reason. A group of freedom fighters developed a Superintelligence that was far too powerful to fall into the wrong hands. Those who were chosen to receive this technology were given incredible gifts, boosting both their mental and physical abilities to a superhuman level. Only those who had access to the network could recognize one another. The wearable AI was developed into the form of golden socks, a seemingly ordinary item with a glimmering nod to its incredible potential to those who are in the know.",
