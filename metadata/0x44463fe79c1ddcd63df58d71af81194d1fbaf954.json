    "description": "An artistic interpretation of the dystopian social science fiction novel by George Orwell, titled \"1984\".\n\nThe highly relevant themes of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation are expressed throughout.\n\nThe piece took 4 years to complete. Initially thought to be finished on 4/2016, additional work on 5/2018, and finally completed in 2/2020. \n\nExtremely detailed, filled with hidden characters, and will have you staring for hours.\n\n1984 - YOU ARE BEING WATCHED\nby\nRabidArtWork\n",
