    "description": "Life is a permanent emotional rollercoaster.A white streak gives way to a dark one, sometimes you blossom like a bud from overflowing inspiration ,or wither from a feeling of burnout. To achieve something you need to constantly throw yourself new challenges. Sometimes you want to give up, but if you draw conclusions and reveal the value of each event, you will understand that your experience is a real treasure .Then a spark will flare up in your heart again and you will want to live and create.
