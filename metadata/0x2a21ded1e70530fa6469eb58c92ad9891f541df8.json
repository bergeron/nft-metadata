    "description": "Location: Ladakh\nCamera: Sony A6500\nLens: 18-105 mm\n\nWhen humans connect with nature for a significant portion of their lives, they often experience a rebirth. Once we recognise that we are an integral part of nature, the enchantment commences. There's a certain beauty to be found in sleeping under the stars that adds a melodic quality to life."
