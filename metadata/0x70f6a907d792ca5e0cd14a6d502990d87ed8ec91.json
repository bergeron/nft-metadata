    "description": "Mongolian and Tibetan legends say that in ancient times, from a distant star, a wonderful Stone – Chintamani in the east, Holy Grail in the west – sent to help people, fell to the ground. Everywhere where the Stone appeared, happiness came. In the west, the Chintamani stone is known as the Holy Grail. In Parzival's novel, Wolfram von Eschenbach claimed the Grail was a Stone. It is also called Lapis exillis, which in alchemy is the name of the Philosopher's stone.",
