    "description": "This collection is a series of photographs documenting the things I \"see\". Seeing implies the observer's awareness of a subject. Thus photography can be used as a tool to reveal objective truths within the subjective. I am fascinated by the point at which these two ideas collide and how this synchronicity provides a moment of awareness for the conscious observer, in my case, me. What do I \"see\" and how do I \"see\" it? \n",
