    "description": "1971 South Vietnamese 1000 dong note and lighter with the South Vietnamese flag. \n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, US spending on the Vietnam War meant that there were far more US dollars circulating than could be exchanged for gold at the price of $35.00 per ounce. Facing a potential economic crisis and rising inflation, US President Richard Nixon shocked the world by announcing that the US would untether the dollar from the gold standard on August 15th, 1971, sparking global inflation.\n\nIn the months prior, France, Germany, and Switzerland had demanded gold in return for their dollars. \n\nThe 1000 dong note shown was first issued in 1971 in response to risiing inflation in South Vietnam. Like in the US, inflation in South Vietnam continued during the war period, and larger notes in denominations of 5,000 and 10,000 dong were printed for release in 1975 but never issued by the new communist government.\n\nPurchaser receives the 1971 1,000 dong note and the modified Zippo lighter.",
