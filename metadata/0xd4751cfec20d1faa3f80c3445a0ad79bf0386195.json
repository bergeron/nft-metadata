Sometimes you may have heard that the cryptocurrency world is full of scams.  \nBut since I have been working full time artist with this community. I met great new friends and gained much support from this community. We communicate with our artistic tastes. We give advice and encourage each other like they give a special gift.  \nI want to include the stories of happiness in this community in every piece of my artwork.\n\nüéÅMerry Christmas.",
