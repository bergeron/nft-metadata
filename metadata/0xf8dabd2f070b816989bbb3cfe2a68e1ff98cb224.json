    "description": "i grew up in these orange groves, my small town built on them. as a child my trampoline was between 4 orange trees in the backyard. i'd bounce & grab oranges from the highest spots on them\n\n- throwing pieces of peel like ninja stars\n\n- an impatient kid with sick stomachs from green oranges\n\n- golden orange freckles speckled the trees, my face the same\n\nmy roots are just as strong as the trees' in these groves, but seasons change. people in towns like mine don't want change, wanting for their children what they had- the same memories & nature around them. \n\nthere's no wrong in this, however the nature they want to preserve isn't part of the natural human progression & the roots it needs\n\nwe're biologically wired to reproduce, needing homes, schools, city infrastructure, etc. the displacement of residents & potential jobs are growing pains of what we do naturally, but not in defense of reckless destruction by companies, governments\n\nso i ask, is there balance? preservation & progression?",
