    "description": "4K Square (2160x2160px), 30 FPS, 20sec, Seamless Loop, 2/50.\n\nIn the second piece of the collection, we go back to the 1940s to experience the gloom of the WW2. In one of the times when the Americans and the Germans are experiencing very violent clashes, we are guests in the German trenches. Who knows, among those who fight, there are those who have many hopes and are the subject of sad songs, children who have lost their parents, and parents who have lost their children.\nWe are witnessing a long and difficult night.\n\n#02 Trench Warfare is the second part of the unique 50-piece Little Worlds collection.",
