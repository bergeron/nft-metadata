    "description": "“Beautiful, colourful, radiant, yet grotesque and somewhat humorous, providing the viewer with an instant dopamine hit of hyper reality.”\n\nScreaming Girl smiles as she trudges through the blackness. But, is it a grin, or a grimace? Is it a distant echo, or a dim roar? Awkward as an alien pretending to be human for social acceptance. Whispers from another dimension, Demons & Angels battling for her soul. Hovering somewhere between good and evil. Her soul is for sale, but who will buy it?\n\nSakura Mori is Born in Japan. Lives and works in London.\n\n・Every piece is unique 1/1\n\n・3510 *4950 JPEG 400dpi\n\n・Ownership and commercial usage rights given to the consumer over this NFT.",
