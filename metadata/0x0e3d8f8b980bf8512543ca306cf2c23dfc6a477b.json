    "description": "SAND-SULTAN \"From Dust You Came From Dust You Return\" We are reminded of our strength and our mortal fragility at the same time in the face of death. It tells a universal tale of how we eventually touch the earth and return to where we came from. A place where we become equals once again propelled from the burdens of this world. Propelled to a place where skin doesn't matter and labels hold no water.",
