    "name": "The Baroness",
    "description": "Baroness Gabriella Langer von Langendorff attends a gala in New York on April 18, 2017.\n\nA website called \"The Steeple Times\" tells us more about the Baroness:\n\n\"The widow of the creator of White Shoulders perfume and resident of The Pierre loves bright colors and once told the New Yorker: 'I never wear a watch at night. I don’t want to know what time it is at night.' The New York Social Diary suggests she even has her 'fur coats dyed to match her emeralds, rubies, diamonds, and sapphires.' They add, 'The Baroness is one of those individuals of indeterminate youth and age, to put it politely, whose legend, long having departed reality, provides a rich lore that may be more enticing than the facts.'”\n\n- Photo created by Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times Styles section\n\n- Part of a large body of work made in years spent covering the philanthropy scene on assignment for The New York Times.\n\n- Chosen for American Photography 34, a preeminent collection of the year's best photography.",
