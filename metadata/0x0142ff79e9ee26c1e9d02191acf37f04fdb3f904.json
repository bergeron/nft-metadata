    "description": "EQ 4 is the inaugural NFT piece from my first solo book project, Equilibrium.  This location has a special place in my photographic journey for a number of reasons, so it is fitting that this piece is the first from this project. \n\nThis location was one of my earliest places to shoot as I made the transition from law to photography. Not seen from this angle is the classic St Paulâ€™s Cathedral and its likely now world famous split reflection. This creates a perfect example of the merging of old and new that is London and is a great example of the balance I seek in all that I do.  \n\nIts name, One New Change, is particularly fitting as it marks the segue from one profession to another. This shot in particular is an appreciation of the interplay between curves and lines; light and shadow; with some texture for good measure.  \n\nSo many people walk through here without taking time to appreciate their surroundings. Let this be your reminder to take the time to look up every once in a while.",
