    "description": "The music used is one of my original songs, \"River Magic\", released on my 2021 album \"Never Die On Halloween\".  The Track was originally composed for this NFT, but ended up being released on an EP first.  Nonetheless, the 3D animation was created and rendered in Blender 3.1.  The clip itself features Susquehanna headbanging .  Her hair isn't on fire, her hair IS fire.  She's rocking out so hard she doesn't even know you're there. ",
