    "description": "As you venture south in California on Highway 1, through Big Sur, past the sandy beach towns that dot the coast, just beyond Cambria and Morro Bay, you'll find the smaller and much quieter coastal town of Los Osos.\n\nFollowing the narrow roads and sand covered homes through Los Osos, a winding road complimented by dense groves of fog drenched Eucalyptus awaits. \n\nThis lonely coastal corridor will sweep you away from the crowded California life and onto one of the most pristine coastlines California has to offer.\n\nIf it's peace you're dreaming of, if it's quiet you seek, this is the road you should follow.\n\nMontaña de Oro, California, March 2015",
