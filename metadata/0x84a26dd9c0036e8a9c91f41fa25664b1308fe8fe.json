    "description": "When the winds of the future seem to be against us, it's easy to give up and feel powerless. But, is it possible these harsh winds know what we need the most?\n\nWhen the winds are against us, is it to test the strength of our spirit? is it a loud voice that's finally made the hidden clear?\n\nOur spirit is what holds us against the uncompromising future, giving us a will to keep going when everything seems against us. It allows us to see the beauty in life, even in the face of the inevitable.",
