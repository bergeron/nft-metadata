    "description": "This edition is part of my collection “The Way We Build - Frankfurt”, a series of aerial images which show a different vision of architecture and how it has evolved over the years.\n\nBy making use of newly available technologies, such as multi-rotor copters and satellite imagery for research, I was able to provide a better perspective of each building, showcasing the fullest uniqueness of each piece.",
