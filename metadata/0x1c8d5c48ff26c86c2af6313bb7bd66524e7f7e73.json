    "description": "This piece puts you in a trance between waiting and patience, we are all on earth waiting for the second coming of our saviour or a transition to a higher power.\n\n“Time stands still as an anticipation and uncertainty mingle in the heart of the patient, waiting for the moment when all will be revealed.”\n\nI put myself into a trance to evolve through this process as time comes to a pause but not a definite stop.\n ",
