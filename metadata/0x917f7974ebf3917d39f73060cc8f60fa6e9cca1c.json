    "description": "This piece was created as part of wider project to introduce a new form of literary art, the psest. \n\nThis is the single 'proto-psest imago token' that was created as a demonstration item alongside actual psest imago tokens.\n\nThough not a true psest token, this piece speaks to literary art's power to run interference on cognitive processes that are too accepting of the kinds of emphatically-relayed statements common in today's social discourse.. The idea is to create a visual experience uncanny enough for its textual components to imprint in the viewer's mind, so that when they encounter the words again, their processing of these words will be mediated somewhat by an experience – the previous viewing of the art – that does not correspond to what they're being told. \n\nThis is a 1/1 token.\n\nFor more on the history of this piece, including a chronology that confirms its creation before September 2022, see here:\n\nhttps://mirror.xyz/benrwms.eth/ioFkw6v0-b-xnCzXv3D3nUNTzTS5F3S7JTr-b_IHwJM",
