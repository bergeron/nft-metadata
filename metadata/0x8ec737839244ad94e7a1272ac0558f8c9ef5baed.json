Maybe not as much as jumping on a bicycle with the seat missing, but it hurts.”— Leslie Nielsen\n\n\nThey say “Don’t take it too seriously”. They say “If you expect other people to be sincere and trustworthy it’s your problem, not theirs”. You learn to go through it with time, just to swallow this pain and to move on. The hardest thing is not to lose your faith in people. The World is harsh, but we should be stronger. \n\n\n\n4000x5000 px, 500 dpi",
