    "description": "A long time ago, I was looking for something to fill my being.  \nI've always looked for a place where I fit in, a place where I belong.  \nObscura was born from this idea. I've always been fascinated by suspense, horror, dark, gloomy and everything else that fits into that darkness. I looked for images from all the years photographed that accompanied this message.  \nThese are photographs collected from 10 years that I photographed in all forms that will soon join this project.\n\nWith that, I leave this free piece as a taste of what's to come.",
