    "description": "I love acoustic versions (sometimes more than the original) so it was only a matter of time before I made one for my song \"if you chase two rabbits\", which features some of my favorite lyrics: \n\nI've been thinking, will I be successful?\nOr just someone who really had potential\n'Cause I'm so used to being overlooked\nAnd tryna prove to people that I'm special\n\n\"if you chase two rabbits\" has become one of my most popular songs and I'm excited for it to be my first drop on Sound! I will be following up this release with the rest of my \"unplugged\" series. ",
