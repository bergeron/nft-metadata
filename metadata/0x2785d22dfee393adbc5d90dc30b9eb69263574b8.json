    "description": "Everything is energy and that's all there is to it.\nMatch the frequency of the energy you want and\nyou cannot help but get that reality.\nIt can be no other way. -Albert Einstein\n\nAside from my family and friends, Stuz0r was the driving force behind all this. A few years back, before all of this NFT thing went crazy, I almost gave up my design career, but I came across Stuz0r's work on Behance, and everything changed. It gave me a second chance.\n\nThis piece represents all of us dreamers and those who are still fighting for their dreams. Nothing is impossible in this world anymore, we will fail along the way, but it's worth the try to trust ourselves that someday, those failures will lead us to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nDaily Renders | Day #365\n\nA collaboration piece between MEJ. and Stuz0r\n\n2000 x 2500\nTools used: Cinema4D, Marvelous Designer and Photoshop\n\n[mejvalencia.com](https://mejvalencia.com/)\n\n[Stuz0r's Links](https://linktr.ee/stuz0r)\n",
