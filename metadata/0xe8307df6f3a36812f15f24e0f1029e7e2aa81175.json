    "description": "Why do I like chaos so much? \n\n20 years ago there was a time in which I used to draw on my math notebook these 1 cm long dudes fighting in an epic battle full of different interactions and explosions. Black and white on grid sheet paper with a regular drawing pen. A sort of \"Where's Waldo?\", where Waldo is at war. \nBack then I drew how I could. Today I draw how I can. Nevertheless both times sharing a concept that connects me with a past that fades to black the deeper I look at. What are the roots of a war where these caterpillar-like monsters incubate themselves inside of what it seems to be a giant bubble gum whose key looks to be held by a powerful and dangerous baby? I don't know, but I hope you enjoy it. ",
