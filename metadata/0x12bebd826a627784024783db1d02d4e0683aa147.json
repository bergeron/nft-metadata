    "description": "Breaking out of a strong religious upbringing in my early twenties forced me to re-evaluate my entire world view. My sense of self felt like Humpty Dumpty after his fall. It took years to sort out the pieces of who I was from who Iâ€™d been indoctrinated to be.\n\nWith knuckles gripped tight, feeling pulled in multiple directions, and my inner critic screaming, this work is a montage of my journey towards identity achievement. Ghosts of the past still linger, but akin to a kintsugi piece, my repair is part of my history, something not to be disguised.\n\n---  \n1/1 edition NFT of original painting 'Identity Crisis' by Jem Ham. \nOriginal artwork details: Acrylic on linen, 2023. 123 x 97.5 cm.",
