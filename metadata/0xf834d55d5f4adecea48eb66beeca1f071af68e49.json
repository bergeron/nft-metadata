That it would be the boundless source of everything that was sought after. A source that demanded nothing in return. They called it: The Promise.\n\nEvery bidder will receive an edition of \"Night of The Promise\" as an airdrop.\n\nProcreate & After Effects, 2022\n\nMade for the Art Innovation Gallery Exhibition during Art Basel Miami 2022.",
