You hear the sounds of cheers and the scorns of FUD before all else. With tongues of silver and with ears that hear, the Fellows will be at your call to direct the minds of the lost to a place of nourishment or away from poisonous streams. Your vote will sway multitudes. Fellows have the ears of all Magus. Men move rubble, Fellows move nations. This power is not to be taken lightly for you must always have the community's best interest at heart.\r\n\r\n**Et omnes audiunt.**",
