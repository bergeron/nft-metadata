    "name": "The Punishment of the Demons",
    "description": "Freedom of choice belongs naturally to an intellectual\r\nnature, and this nature remains in the demons. But freedom of choice is ordered per se and primarily\r\ntoward good rather than to evil. Therefore, a demonâ€™s will is not so obstinate in evil that he cannot return\r to the good.\n A place is a place of punishment for an angel or for a soul not in the sense\r\nthat it affects them by altering their nature, but in the sense that it affects them by saddening their will,\r\nsince the angel or soul sees himself as being in a place that is not agreeable to his will.\n\nOrginal Art by Soham ",
