You will also receive images and information about the race during the competition.\n\nAll the bidders in the auction will have a small honorary sponsor but only the winner will have the big sponsorship.\n\nMore info on my twitter @chipiron_eth\n\nI hope you enjoy DAKARPEPE as much as I have enjoyed creating it. üê∏üèÅ\n\n",
