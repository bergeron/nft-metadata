    "created_by": "Rev",
    "description": "The first edition of a series exploring the male gaze and its effect on society. \n\nTunnel Vision is an art piece depicting two women with their faces and lower legs obscured. The piece explores the concept of the male gaze and the idea that women are often objectified and sexualized in visual media, particularly by the way they are portrayed in art, film, and advertising. \nThe blurring of the women's faces and lower legs emphasizes this objectification by reducing them to just their bodies, rather than seeing them as complete individuals.  \nTunnel Vision is a commentary on the ways women are represented and how this can perpetuate harmful attitudes towards women.",
