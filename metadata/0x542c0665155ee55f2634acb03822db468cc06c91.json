    "description": "“We were having dinner with the family and at that moment our area of   the city was attacked by Russian missiles” - I think for many of us from Ukraine this is familiar.\n\nWith this art, I want to show that we are not afraid and are fighting for our independence, Ukraine cannot be broken, we will destroy Russian fascism.\nWhat is happening now with us in Ukraine is the genocide of the Ukrainian people.  Every day Russian missiles destroy Ukrainian cities.\nMore than 3100 rockets (from one to five ton rockets), millions of shells, billions of cartridges.\nTens of thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands more lost their homes, \nit was destroyed.\nWe are fighting for freedom and independence, I am grateful to every country that helps us Ukrainians.  Many countries said that Ukraine would not last even three days, but we have been holding out for almost 200 days and are successfully destroying Russian fascists.  Putin's regime must be destroyed\n\nGlory to Ukraine! ",
