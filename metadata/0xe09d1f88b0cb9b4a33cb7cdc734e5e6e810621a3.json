    "description": "An ancient legend tells the story of a man named Richard, who, having explored the sea, was caught in a severe storm. Waves carried him far from home, to the shore of a deserted island. No one had previously known of the existence of this land. The island was very large and nature wonderful. And then Richard built himself a house, made a vegetable garden and began to grow crops on it. He had never tasted such a delicious meal. Soon, he swam home and told everyone about this wonderful place. People laughed and did not believe, but he convinced them to swim together. People were excited about what they saw. Richard showed them a different life. That's how Empire Farm came about!",
