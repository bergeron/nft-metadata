    "description": "Sometimes you want to hide from the noise of the outside world, behind the chords of your favorite music. But the eyes see everything, and from that they are filled with tears. \nOne can only hope that the quality of the tears will change, and they will become tears of joy.\n\nartist: Loona May",
