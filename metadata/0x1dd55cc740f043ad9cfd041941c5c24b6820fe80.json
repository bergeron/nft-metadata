    "description": "Elizabeth was born with a cursed hand in a city in which people used light magic. She became a very strange, isolated, and arrogant personality. In her hometown, everyone, even her family, distances themselves from her. So, as she got older, her interest in dark magic grew more and more, and she changed her name to Liz. She read on an old tablet that she could learn dark magic from a book that was buried in a deserted city. She found the book and started to learn smoke magic. Her hand hurt a lot due to using dark magic a lot. Meanwhile, she mistakenly releases ancient evils that escape from the enchanted book and attack other cities.",
