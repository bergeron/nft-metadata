    "description": "This scene takes place in the legendary Byblos Hotel in Saint Tropez. The photo was taken on August 25th - the anniversary of my engagement with my husband. This is the first collage I’ve created in the “INSurREAL” series. The name of the series is a combination of words : “Instagram” - because the photos are meant for my Instagram feed and they are a sort of polemic with the unrealistically perfected content shown on social media, “surreal”-because the artwork fits into the neosurrealism movement, and finally “real” - because these are real photos taken in every day life (which is full of travelling and jet set locations). \nIn the collage there are elements from one of my favourite photographers- Helmut Newton (this artwork was created shortly after visiting the “Newton Riviera” exhibition in Monte Carlo; and a figure from my most admired surrealist artist - Paul Delvaux. The total image creates an uncanny feeling. The ambiance is melancholic - where there’s no clear feeling of time.",
