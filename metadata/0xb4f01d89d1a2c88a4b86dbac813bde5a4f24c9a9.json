    "description": "“If only time traveling is possible”— Taken in Ginza, Tokyo. Capturing the vibrant street lights and the loneliness of a salaryman after work. Digital textiles were used in this piece to create unlimited extensions of space and time. The layers of vibrant lights juxtapose the loneliness of the salaryman, drowned in the glow after dark. Take a blink and the moment will never exist again. \n\nSize 4000 x 6000\n",
