    "description": "As we draw closer to the end of the year, we also have the coldest of seasons just around the corner.\nIt is my favourite part of the year. The fashion is definitely counts here, but my for me, the best thing about this season are the flowers. It is one of the things I look most forward to, and a reason why I love winters in India. \n\nSummers are great (especially with all the ice-cold beverages), but enjoying hot tea while basking in the warm sun, surrounded by a palette of vibrant hues is really as perfect as it sounds. \n\nThis piece is inspired by those moments of pure bliss.\n\nThe reason I used \"perennial\" for the flowers I see only once a year is because no matter where I am or what I am doing, the memory of being surrounded by such beauty will always remain in my mind and heart.\n\nâœ¿\n\nI am offering the first owner of this NFT the physical piece I created using handmade paper flowers and acrylics.\n\nAbout the canvas: 12 x 12 MDF canvas with holes at the back to hang the piece.",
