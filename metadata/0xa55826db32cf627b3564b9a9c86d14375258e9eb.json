    "description": "This clay sculpture depicts an astronaut from the NFT project Boonji that I made in October 2021. As a first-time clay sculptor, I created it at a traditional sculptor's workshop because I lacked the necessary supplies. The accompanying image shows the work-in-progress astronaut sculpture being heated with fire to speed up the drying process, while the background features a raw goddess idol and the workshop's traditional and messy atmosphere.",
