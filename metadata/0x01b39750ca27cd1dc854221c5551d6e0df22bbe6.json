    "description": "'Fettered Spiders' Iteration Pt. I began as just any old photograph in any old album. The photos were accidentally destroyed by the elements and rather then throw them away, they were mounted to a large canvas & sealed with a heavy gloss medium. This large canvas is part of the series as my genesis piece, but is separate from the Iterations. \n\nThe photos were then digitally imported and remastered & redrawn in Adobe Illustrator & Procreate. \nMixed Medium . 6000 x 6000 x 300 dpi",
