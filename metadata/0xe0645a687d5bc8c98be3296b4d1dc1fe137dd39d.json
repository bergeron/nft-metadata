    "description": "Something equally joyful and deeply sad ensues when you leave Nigeria to plant roots in the US. You leave everything that inspires you behind; your family, your favorite food, your accent, your tribe, all for a better life. \n\nAlthough you now have all the comfort of life, you are left with a hole that only deepens as time passes. You slowly are becoming neither Nigerian nor American.\n\nThey say music mends the soul, and I was lucky to find solace in Burna boy's music. This is a tribute to the artist that healed me. ",
