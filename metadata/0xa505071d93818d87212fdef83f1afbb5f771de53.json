    "description": "Before I go to sleep, I often twist situations that happened this afternoon or a couple of years ago. It's not a search for the right option that I might have responded to that asshole at the gas station a month ago. I live through the day without anxiety, and after a while starting to parse situations, I try to understand why and why I took a step to the right or looked at someone in passing. I analyze only myself: my thoughts, actions, feelings, every step. With time I realized that I could not just fall asleep or stare at the ceiling and think about nothing. Thoughts are like poison entering my head, which makes me constantly torment myself. I can't remember when it started, and now I'll definitely think about that too. Nothing can cause as much moral damage as you do yourself. Devouring myself day after day, replaying the same moments. It replayed in my head so often that I can count the number of breaths I took in that moment. I'm not preying on others, I'm eating myself...",
