    "description": "REMO'S World is an art project by Joey Tadiar built on 4 core elements; Art Drops, Physical Toys, Physical Art and Evolution. The voyage begins with the REMO Virtual Pet, which grants access to both Joeyâ€™s digital and physical creations. Eventually, all REMO Virtual Pets will evolve into a unique, 1/1 REMO toy, which collectors can use as their PFP. This is the start of an exciting series of drops and loyal holders will be invited to join all future voyages with REMO and Joey, wherever they go, however far they travel.",
