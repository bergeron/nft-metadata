    "name": "Fallen Angel",
    "description": "In Abrahamic religions, fallen angels are angels who were expelled from heaven. The literal term \"fallen angel\" appears neither in the Bible nor in other Abrahamic scriptures, but is used to describe angels cast out of heaven or angels who sinned. Such angels often tempt humans to sin.\n\nThe idea of fallen angels derived from the Book of Enoch, a Jewish pseudepigraph, or the assumption that the \"sons of God\" mentioned in Genesis 6:1â€“4 are angels. In the period immediately preceding the composition of the New Testament, some sects of Judaism, as well as many Christian Church Fathers, identified these same \"sons of God\" as fallen angels. During the late Second Temple period the Biblical giants were sometimes considered the monstrous offspring of fallen angels and human women. In such accounts, God sends the Great Deluge to purge the world of these creatures; their bodies are destroyed, yet their peculiar souls survive, henceforth roaming the earth as demons.\n\nResolution: 2048x2048 JPEG",
