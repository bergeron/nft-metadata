    "description": "The reaching hand for salvation.\n\nA pioneer trying to save his people, a community watching him in horror. The light seeping through the crack illuminates him, but he reaches for it, not knowing what it is. Humakind is often unsure of what he is doing, but he can neither go back nor give up. But he instinctively knows he has to put an end to it, I don't think he's afraid of death. But there are things we don't know about them, and so we must judge everything on their terms.\n\nPerhaps corruption is tantamount to death for them.\n\nThe fine line between the desire to live and the fear of death.",
