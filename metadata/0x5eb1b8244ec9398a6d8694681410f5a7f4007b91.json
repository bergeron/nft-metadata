    "description": "Created drone shots that showcase the natural beauty of our world, from the crystal clear pools to the vast expanse of the ocean and the fluid grace of surfers. But I don't stop there, I disrupt these idyllic scenes with bold and striking spray paint. This contrast highlights the tension between natural and man-made, and the impact humanity has on the world. I believe that my unique perspective, captured through drone photography, can create thought-provoking and visually striking pieces of art.\n\nLocation: Sydney, Australia,\nDimensions: 2588 × 3225",
