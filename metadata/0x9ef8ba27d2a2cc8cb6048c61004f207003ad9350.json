    "description": "The very first idea of this project crossed my mind when I was at my mother’s grave, being\npreoccupied with her death and feeling of missing her. There is a magnificent and stunning bitter\norange tree at her grave, and I feel its leaves root in my mother’s spirit. I literally have multiple\nfeelings about this tree, such as love, fear, and ambiguity! I named this set “Dead Leaves” to depict\nbeauty and death at the same time. This set includes different symbols that refer to specific subjects (human traits) such as butterflies, sea, sky, egg, and brain. Butterfly’s wings, brain, sea, stone, sky, and egg are symbols of beauty, strength, thought, vastness, pride and difficulty, infinite area, and human embryo, respectively.\nThe sea is full of beautiful seashells that were alive sometime. I used seashells, crabs, and starfish in the photo. On the corner, there is a small coast where perished crabs are standing. For me, impaired crabs are interpreted as being related to illness.",
