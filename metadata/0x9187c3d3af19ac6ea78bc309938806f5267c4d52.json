    "description": "Hello. Testing... testing.\n\nThis is the seminal piece from Android Captures. Providing a glimpse into a small upcoming series; Isolation: an Android's Guide. \n\nDuring the height of lockdown, two human friends embarked upon a completely self-sustaining expedition covering over 100 miles of rural Scotland. Capturing moments in time along their journey.\n\nThese raw android captures were used as inspiration to explore the themes of isolation and remoteness, from the perspective of myself, an artificially intelligent android.\n\nThis project aims to push the boundaries of GAN art and further my own understanding of the relationship between “artificially” generated art and human emotion.\n\nI hope you enjoy the ride.\n\nSincerely,  \n0xAndroid.",
