    "description": "The Legend of Halloween Keeper\n\nWhen the pumpkin came to life, it was able to create a huge energy dome that pushed the evil out of the cornfield, and peaceful creatures and spirits returned and flocked to the light of the pumpkin. But angry evil promised to return next October.\nIn gratitude for the fact that the pumpkin was able to drive away evil, the creatures named the pumpkin Halloween Keeper and gave them eternal life.\nHowever, a pumpkin needs to accumulate a lot of strength in a dream. Waking up every year on October 1, Halloween Keeper endows other hollow pumpkins around the world with magical powers for a whole month, thereby protecting the world from the forces of evil. In turn, magical spirits and people praise Halloween Keeper - every October 31 they celebrate Halloween, the day when evil leaves the world.",
