    "description": "Reindeers move in an effortless and graceful way trough the terrain. Hiking in the same habitat can be a strenuous task. Regardless of the efforts, and in spite of the ever changing weather in these parts of the country, I always bring my camera. \n\nThese animals rarely appear as close as this one did. This fellow suddenly occurred in front of me on one of my morning walks, and stood there for only a couple of seconds. I think we both were surprised. Luckily I manage to take some pictures. Circumstances had it that the low morning sun was positioned in an angle behind it, consequently producing some nice bokeh in the picture. \n\nThis is the type of encounters I seek. \n\nIf collector contacts me, Iâ€™ll share a link to a high resolution file -  3712-4640.\n\nArtwork specs:\nName: Brief encounter\nSize: 8 MB 3712-4640\nEdition: 1/1\nType: JPEG",
