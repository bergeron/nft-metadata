    "description": "In everyone's struggle for daily living, there is a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can't go forward anymore a moment of pause and think. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact, that's how we were meant to survive And keep pedaling forward through the dusty roads of life.\n\nEdition 1/1\nArtist: Manoj PM",
