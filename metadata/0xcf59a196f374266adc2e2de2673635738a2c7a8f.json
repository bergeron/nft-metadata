    "description": "Ellie, who needs emerald citadels? What do you dream about when you fall asleep? \n\nWithin each of us there is a mysterious world of dreams. There is an ancient call coming from the depths of time, a longing for perfection, for goodness, for unity, for love. We must listen to it in the depths of our souls. And pay more attention to our dreams. After all, everything that exists in this world was once a dream.\n\n",
