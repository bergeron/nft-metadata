    "description": "This is a CC0 derivative of \"Seize the Carpoolers\" by Alejandro Cartagena and Adrian De La Garza, card #37 of The Memes Szn 1.\n\nThe Meme Ninja projects encourages us to tell stories about The Memes that can spread outside the Web3 bubble.\n\n\"Carpoolers\" already has a story.  It is part of Alejandro's long-term project to document and examine the way economic expansion has been distributed unevenly in Mexico, and the real-life consequences of this.  Documenting workers travelling too and from employment, \"Carpoolers\" was an iconic photography collection prior to crypto and has become a foundation in the NFT photography world.  \n\nTo quote from Jessica S. McDonald‘s essay from the Carpoolers book:\n\n\"Divested of their individuality through Cartagena’s clinical approach, as well as their conflation with so many other implements of labor, the men confined to these shallow boxes become almost interchangeable.\"\n\nThis is also the case for many Web3 participants today.  Aspiring for a better life through crypto, faceless and nameless, investing time and money into both the dream, the mission and the tokens.\n\nRead more about Carpoolers: http://www.circuitgallery.com/artists/alejandro-cartagena/carpoolers/ \n",
