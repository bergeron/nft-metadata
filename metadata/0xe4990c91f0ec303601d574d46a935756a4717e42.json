    "description": "Girls in Afghanistan have not been able to go to secondary school since the Taliban takeover in August 2021.\n\n50% of revenue will be sent to @MalalaFund which is currently focused on education for girls in Afghanistan.\n\nSome quotes from girls in Afghanistan: \n\n“I want to go to school and become an independent woman who chooses and decides for her life. If I am educated, men wouldn’t dare to interfere but if I am not, they will decide my whole life for me.” - Nasiba, Human Rights Watch (article written by Fereshta Abbasi)\n\n“The day the Taliban took control, I was thinking: This is the end of life for women” - Zayba, NY Times (article written by Victor J. Blue & David Zucchino)\n\n“I thought of the explosion, and I thought they would come and kill every student... I can’t concentrate in my studies... When we think about our future, we can’t see anything.” - Sanam, NY Times (article written by Victor J. Blue & David Zucchino)",
