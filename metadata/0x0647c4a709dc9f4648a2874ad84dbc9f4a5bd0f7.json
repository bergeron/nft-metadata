    "description": "Since the creation of the universe \nBeings have questioned the source of energy that materializes reality \nHow can we harness this ether?\nThe life energy of the world\nHow can we illuminate the tyranny imposed by the dark one \nIt puzzled me so I had no choice but to ask someone wiser than myself \nNor the plants or the rocks could remember. \nEven the rocks couldnâ€™t tell me. \nI continue my quest in search \nOf the ether \nThe only known element \nThat can defeat Lord Noctis once and for all. \nIn hope to turns the tides of the war in favor of the light \nUncovered a lost scribe \nContaining encrypted translations \nTo forge magic Armour and weaponry \nArmor that can withstand temptation \nAnd swords that cut through darkness\nAs Noctis approaches a sense of fear surrounds the sky \nAs I finally arrive  to the (k)NIGHTCLUB \nWhere the code of honor is to protect creation \n\n\nTo be a knight \nEven on the darkest days \n\nSincerely (k)",
