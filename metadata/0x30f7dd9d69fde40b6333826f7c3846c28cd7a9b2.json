    "description": "I first photographed the moon intersecting with the statue of Liberty in 2014.\n\nThat night in 2014 I was just taking a photo of the Statue of Liberty when I noticed the moon rising heading towards the crown of Lady Liberty and I was just stunned at how beautiful the Statue of Liberty looked with the moon rising behind it.\n\nAfter that I was hooked, I started researching how to predict and capture the moon rising behind the statue.. This was before all of the apps. I was obsessed with trying to capture a more perfect alignment. \n\nThese editions represent the best of my Luna Liberty alignment captures since 2014.",
