    "description": "I have only one reason for making this art work that I love animals very much. We need that all of us should love animals and we  should understand that they should, after all, if you love animals once, then see that they will love you more than you, so this was the purpose of making this art work of mine.  grow love for animals and people are killing them day by day which is very wrong if we keep killing animals slowly then our system gets spoiled. \n\nAnimals are reliable, many full of love, true in their affections, predictable in their actions, grateful and loyal. Difficult standards for people to live up to.‚Äù\n\n\nWild Friends Concept Artwork.\n\nThank you....!",
