    "description": "This is my favourite picture. Might be a bit punchy for everyone's taste, but that is explainable as I am colourblind. I took this picture while driving towards Geiranger Fjord and was amazed when I saw the landscape unfolding in front of my eyes so I just pulled the car off the road and took this beaute. The sun rays are coming right through the lens and the picture is extremely deep as you can see beyond the mountains rising in the center. Single shot full res photo, edited in Lightroom. NEF available upon request.\n\nNikon D5100, 10 mm, f/22, 1/1200, ISO-320",
