    "description": "In 2018 I won an international photo contest that gave me an opportunity to shoot some of the most epic locations in the USA. The Golden gate Bridge, in San Francisco Bay, considered one of the most photographed bridges in the world was on my top list. My self-challenge then was to do a fresh take, which I did. This shot is to date, one of my most successful and popular - my first image featured in National Geographic as the Top shot and an Editorâ€™s Spotlight in 2018, and, a favorite in my social media gallery. It also paved the way for new doors of opportunity in my photographic journey.",
