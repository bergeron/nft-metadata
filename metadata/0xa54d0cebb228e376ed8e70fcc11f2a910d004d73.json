    "name": "Autumn Backwater",
    "description": "This NFT is digital copy of real-world painting by Mariola Åšwigulska. Only 1 NFT belongs to one real painting in this series which makes it connected to real world asset. Original has been painted using acrylic and gold metal. Beautiful, sunny, colorful autumn. Orange, yellow and green leaves adorn the branches of the trees. A charming backwater, full of peace and solace. An oasis of peace and positive energy contained on the canvas. The artist used schlagmetal to create a lake, thanks to which she rendered the sun shimmering on the surface of the water. Szlagmetal makes the image, depending on the light falling on it, shimmer with gold, more or less radiant, thanks to which it changes its face. The artist transferred her love for nature and longing for the charm of autumn onto canvas. The work is signed in the lower right corner. It does not require framing thanks to aesthetically painted sides.",
