    "description": "Have you ever felt like you are out of ideas and unable to do anything creative or productive? Thatâ€™s a creative block -a common phenomenon among artists, photographers, and other creatives. The block can be a result of many different factors including exhaustion, lack of inspiration, or feeling stuck in your work. \n\nThis was precisely what I was feeling in the fall 2021. Too much work, too much stress, and no inspiration to create anything new. A frightening feeling for any creative!\n\nCreating this image got me out of that creative hole and that is why this is so important image for me. I hope this image/animation will inspire you and help you when you are down and feel uninspired. \n\nType: Animation\nSize: 1920x1080, 25fps, 18sec loop\n",
