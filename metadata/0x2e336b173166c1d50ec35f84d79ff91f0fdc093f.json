    "description": "Allegorical Figure of Day & Night is my first reactive piece. It follows the earth's pattern and will transition at sunset and sunrise from its day form to night form based on geolocation.  \nThe cyclical pattern of the day transforming into night and back is coded into our existence. Our physical state, mental state and the countless processes our bodies carry out are all governed by nature’s circadian rhythms.  \n\nThe sun rising (the day) represents new life and possibilities for the conscience mind.  \nAs day gives way to night with its all-enveloping darkness, the symbolism transitions into a more introspective calm. The conscious mind prepares to rest while the subconscious awakens in our dreams—a delicate play of yin and yang. As light beckons to life and death invites everlasting darkness, the two join together to create a state of equilibrium.  \n\nAllegorical Figure of Day & Night is synchronized to transform with the rising and setting of the sun, representing these natural shifts that govern so much in our lives. It is a reminder that we run not on our manufactured clocks but on nature's time, and we need to respect it.  \n\n[View Fullscreen](https://transient-labs.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmY8W94syRzSDfvQag3M79fqq4zte2vuJXufTZrTCrkmBr)",
