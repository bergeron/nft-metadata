    "name": "The Power of the Renaissance - Raffaello in Urbino",
    "description": "Giuseppe di Dio brings you in the historical and contemporary path of a constantly evolving Italy. Revealed after a geographical journey, Raphaelâ€™s gaze expresses the true power of the Renaissance through an impactful geo-portrait having a futuristic design. The artistic refinement is further enhanced by the butterfly, which becomes a subject of interest to Raphael, and whose flight seems to create a connection between the Renaissance spirit of the past and that of the future. This is an ideological and emotional NFT, where the Italian beauty of the landscapes blends with an artistic and cultural taste that has been never seen before. ",
