    "description": "'Transceding Time'\n\n\nThe only 'human thing' that can transcend time is LOVE. \nIn this piece, you can see someone who transcended, that person in question learned how to TRULY love something, after death, he became love itself, he is greater than any living being could hope to be, he will not hate, kill and steal anymore. It is death that completes a man.\n\nTransceding Time is my first animated artwork, it is also going to be my first NFT from my animated collection.\nIt took 2 weeks to finish, also took 24 hours to render 230 frames.\n\nCreated in Cinema 4D, 3D rendered with Octane Render, using Mandelbrot concept to create and abstract distortion, edited in After Effects and Photoshop.\n\n1360 x 1600, 24 frames.",
