    "description": "The universe is a vast canvas, painted with strokes of mystery and awe. It's like a joke told in a forest, unheard until we're there to laugh.\n\nThe butterfly is a symbol of the soul, immortality, rebirth and resurrection, the ability to transform, to transform.  It was to her that the Buddha in his final sermon addressed.\n\nopen your eyes and see the world with fresh wonder, for there are mysteries and beauty waiting to be discovered. Respect the energy that surrounds us, and let us embrace the cycles of growth and transformation, just like the butterfly. And if all else fails, at least we can find solace in a good joke told in the forest.",
