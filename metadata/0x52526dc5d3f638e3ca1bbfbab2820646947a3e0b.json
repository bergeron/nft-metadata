    "description": "This artwork describes a boy fishing in a river close to his village and he witnessed a huge fish sitting beside him on a rock. He doesn't have an Idea of what was going to happen after the fish appeared.\n\nI wanted to create something really different from reality. This is a fierce truth about humankind. We get to live however we want thinking about our necessities and being selfish, greedy and voracious unknowingly or sometimes intentionally.\n\nArtwork made using Clip studio paint ex. \nEdition - 1/1\nResolution - 3000 x 3800\nDPI - 72\n\n\n",
