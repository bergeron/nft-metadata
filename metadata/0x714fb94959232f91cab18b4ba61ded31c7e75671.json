    "description": "The photographs were taken on Sunday 13 March 2022 in Berlin at a large, peaceful protest in which tens of thousands marched in support of ending war in Ukraine. An event, the scale of which is so big, is impossible to contain in a photograph. The pictures focus instead on small fragments and gestures as incremental parts of a bigger, moving reality.\n\n50% of all primary sales will be donated to the Ukraine charity project  Unchain Fund.
