    "description": "Cold early morning, dewy forest, foggy swamps. The first rays of the sun try to warm the skin. The petals taste like honey in the mouth. After I took this photo, we went down to the swamps, moisture was in the air and smelled of freshness. Clouds move very quickly across the sky, occasionally letting in sunlight. Raindrops fall on the skin and absolute happiness and freedom are felt.",
