    "description": "untitled XXIII\nFrom an ongoing series of works moving along the subtle border between beauty and obscurity. Using photo manipulation I hide what is usually a beautiful subject behind curtains of grunge, yet delicate patterns and textures.\nAs to remind that beauty is not always obvious yet present.\n\nOriginal photography: Kamyar Ghalamchi",
