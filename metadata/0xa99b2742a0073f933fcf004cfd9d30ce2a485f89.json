    "description": "Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra won the Eurovision Song Contest, a clear show of popular support for the group’s war-ravaged nation that went beyond music. The band and its song “Stefania” beat 24 other performers on the 14th May  in the grand final of the competition. The 439 fan votes is the highest number of televote points ever received in a Eurovision contest, now in its 66th year.",
