    "description": "Reckless Universe of Gee is a collection of humorous photographs depicting my journey in Web3. Lesson 1 in Web3 space is do not get rugged, however I want to change that by rugging myself for people's enjoyment. I enjoy turning a negative concept into something that is accepted and loved. Follow my quest to get rugged as many places as I can possibly imagine with friends along the way.\n\nWelcome to R.U.Gee and all its faceplanting glory!",
