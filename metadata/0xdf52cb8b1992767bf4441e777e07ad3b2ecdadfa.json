    "description": "The night is young and guess who has an invite to every Halloween event happening in the spooky month of October? Ruby Love! \n\nShe saunters through the streets of the well-lit city, hopping in and out of multiple venues. She can’t help but feel captivated by the rich blend of New Earth and its various colours of intergalactic influence.  \n\nRuby Love decides to drag Panteha and Morgana to a party that she believes is the one, a classic Earth-style Halloween party. “What a wholesome way to end the night”, she thinks to herself. \n\n“Huddle up for a picture, girls! This is how ‘Earthling’ hotties throw a Halloween party!”",
