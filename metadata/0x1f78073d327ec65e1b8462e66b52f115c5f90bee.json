    "description": "Mono no aware (物の哀れ), literally \"the pathos of things\", is a Japanese idiom for the awareness of impermanence. Mono no aware is the core concept of Japanese traditional aesthetics, which is the emotional immersion in foreign objects: cherry blossoms fall, cicadas cry, lovers look back... From this, we realize that things are impermanent, and the most beautiful is only in an instant.\n\n1904x2380 pixel",
