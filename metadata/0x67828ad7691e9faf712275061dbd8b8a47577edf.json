    "description": "HUMAN-TIMELINE-ARCHITECTURE\n\nI see in my dreams different universes,  realities and times. I see the endless possibilities of the human being. I see crazy forms around and I recreate these forms in dance. \nIn this collaborative collection with Ukrainian photographer Tanya Bohdanova, my dreams came true.\n\nThe triangle construction was built in 1973 by Ukrainian female architect Alla Onishenko. People dreamed about space flights and a glittering future for everyone in those days. Nowadays, we call this epoch Earlier Ukrainian Modernism.\n I tried to emphasize its modernity and how it resonates with all tendencies in our world through my geometric dance positions.\n\nPart of the sales will go to animal shelters, volunteer organizations, and support of Ukrainian artists.",
