    "description": "Saudade is a deep emotional state of nostalgia or deep melancholy nostalgia for something or someone you care about and/or love. Moreover, it often brings a repressed knowledge that the object of desire may never be had again. It is the memory of feelings, experiences, places or events that once brought excitement, pleasure and well-being, which now trigger the senses and make you experience the pain of separation from those joyful sensations. Saudade describes a feeling that is both happy and sad, and could be approximated by the English expression 'bitter sweet'.\n\nPortuguese",
