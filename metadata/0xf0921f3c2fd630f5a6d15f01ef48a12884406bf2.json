This piece will be an attraction for your metaverse living rooms. The table offers a unique touch to any room, be it in virtual or actual reality. The form has been inspired by parametric shapes.The architecture of this object is utterly fascinating, combining geometry with the illusion of gravity to create a piece that is both unique and creative.",
