    "description": "Inspiration for this piece was sparked in a daydream. Within my minds eye an indistinct creature appeared in the distance walking through a vegetative landscape. Vines of vibrant ivy towered around me into the sky, hanging from cotton clouds like threaded beads of leaves and green tangles. I peered through the glowing green wall of plants to face the beautiful being before me. I came face to face with a tiger engulfed in saturated flames, which multiplied infinitely. The longer I stared the more details formed throughout its burning fur. The tiger gazed into my eyes with a fearless contemplative stare, in this moment I felt connected to the majestic beast.\n\nCurrently, there are roughly 13,000 tigers left on the planet. \n",
