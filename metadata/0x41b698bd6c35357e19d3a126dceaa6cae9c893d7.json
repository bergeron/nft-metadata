    "description": "DOS Flames is a playful, nostalgic, pop-art tribute to a particular 8-bit video game fire sprite icon of the past. Original pixels were slightly reconfigured and then completely reinterpreted through a popular DOS art script in a multitude of hues.\n\nDOS Flames include 718 static flame GIFs and 71 animated flame GIFs provided in a progressive array of 359 hues across the visible light spectrum. 359 static flames lean left and another 359 lean right; each is completely unique in color and detail. Animations were formed by the melding of 142 of the static sets.",
