    "description": "it is 1967. i am 6 years old. that was when my journey to where i am now began.\n\nthat’s the year Ellison’s “i have no mouth and i must scream” was published. it’d be another 5-6 years before i read it for myself and when i did, it gave me nightmares. it gives me nightmares still. \n\nthat story was my introduction to AI. \n\nhow ironic that i now find myself immersed in AI art, loving it, obsessed by it … \n\nfor i have peered into the disturbing dreams of the AI and can’t help but wonder:\n\nwhat happens when the dreaming mind of the Web awakens?\n\nwhat kind of monster might emerge from an intellect born of the internet?\n\nall of humanity’s dirty little secrets and darkest dreams, our ‘collective unconscious’ … what happens when that becomes the foundation of an AI mind?\n\n“i have no mouth and i must scream”\n\ndigital 1/1 artwork by #e9Art April 2022 … 15000 x 9000 ",
