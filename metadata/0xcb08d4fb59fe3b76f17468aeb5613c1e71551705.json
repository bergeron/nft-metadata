    "description": "The 666 Dystopians are pieces of art portraying imagery of evil societies in a post-apocalyptic time. This collection is all about art, which is why there are no traits. This allows collectors to use their artistic eye to determine the value of a piece. Each image contains a lone survivor walking through the dismantled streets, allowing collectors to envision their life during a dark time.",
