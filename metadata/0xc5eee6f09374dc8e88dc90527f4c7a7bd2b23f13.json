    "name": "Serene Night in JVT. Part 1.",
    "description": "The photograph was taken while I was driving through the streets of this residential area in Dubai â€“ JVT during the winter night, when the humidity drops and the moon appears larger and brighter. The image captures the shining lights of the moon as it peeks out from behind two towers. I overexposed the street lights and the moon to create an otherworldly atmosphere and mystery of the scene which adds an abstract and artistic flair to it.  \nJVT district, Dubai, UAE.",
