    "description": "Endless moss hills. Two warriors are fighting to the death. For one of them life is at stake, for another one – dinner.\n\nUnfortunately for some tardigrades (also known as water bears) their kind may be divided into two groups: those who drinks microphytes (microscopical sea grasses) and those who can eat microphytes but prefers flash… sometimes flash of their own kin.\n\nIt is sad, but this particular “herbivorous” tardigrade will become its carnivorous enemy’s meal.",
