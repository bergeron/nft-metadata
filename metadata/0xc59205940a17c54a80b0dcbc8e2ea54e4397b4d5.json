    "description": "1/1\n54sec\nSOUND ON NOW\n\na second collaboration with AI generative artist Ivona Tau, this time a 4 part series based around the chronological sections of THERE IS NO DISTANCE BETWEEN US. The track, an ode to UDH (Unified Dancefloor Humanity), has been sliced and matched with Ivonas crowd imagery. \n\nVisuals were created by training a custom AI model on a curated set of several thousand photographs. All of the photographs were selected from the artistâ€™s personal archive, spanning almost a decade of her career as a concert photographer. While the captured musical performances differ in their style, genre, countries and locations,  they all illustrate humanity united in love for music. When experiencing this shared passion, all boundaries and differences disappear. Through the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and ambiguous imagery, Ivona aims to create a universal representation of crowd madness guided by sound.\n\nfeel the rush \n\n",
