    "description": "When I found out I was bipolar, one of my main frustrations was that I'll have to take medication for life. My doctor told me: imagine you are hypertensive and have to take medication to be stable. That gave me some relief; different people go trough this too.  \n\nFor me, specially when I went trough the most tough manic states, it was medication that pulled me over to reality again. A sedated reality that with time became more clear. It was the price I had to pay to regain my sense of self and stop the angst of the people who loved me.  \n\nNow, they're as familiar as breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've became responsible with it, and never stopped taking it, because for me, it’s safer to do it. Even though I respect people who doesn’t, but it’s just not for me. They have become a part of my life, and I accept that.",
