    "description": "Opening Act: The Journey Begins is a piece very close to my heart as it's the first artwork I've made that I can stand behind and say I'm very proud of. All of the characters are different shades of blue in a subtle nod to mental health awareness, something I'm passionate about. This piece shows my love for cartoons and the curtain being opened up on my imagination. The meteors and cartoon on a rocket flying through the sky test the limits of outer space and my imagination. Definitely the crown jewel of WLD according to CASCAD3.",
