    "description": "I've tokenized on Ethereum for 4 years pre-merge. Today, EXPAND represents my first music NFT minted on Ethereum post-merge, and I'm beyond grateful. It's been quite the journey to get to this point, and I'm feeling energized.\n\nEXPAND was written and performed by me, with production from the homie MAiWORLD. The track is ultimately about striving for more, sticking to your plans, beating the odds and celebrating. The beat is ðŸ”¥ so I had to bless it!\n\nThe inspiration for the cover art came from the artwork I created for my generative music NFT project, Digital CD.v1. For that project I used a palette of 5 colors with the intent to explore more CD colors in future drops. Green felt like a perfect match for EXPAND.\n\nREWARDS: Collectors holding EXPAND on the snapshot date (10/20/22) will also receive an airdropped EXTERNAL DRiVE NFT to hold, gift or sell. EXTERNAL DRiVES are access tokens used to unlock content on danky.xyz. ",
