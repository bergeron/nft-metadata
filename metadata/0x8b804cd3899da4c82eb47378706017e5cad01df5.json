So goes Summer's mantra. \n\nHer beauty is just one part of her power over those who value such superficial traits, and truthfully who does not? Every coat, every nail, every strand of hair is all placed tactically for maximum effect. \n\nEven before a single word is spoken, she always ensures her victory the moment you lay your eyes on her.\n\n3500x3500px",
