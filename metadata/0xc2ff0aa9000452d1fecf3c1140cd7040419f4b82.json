    "description": "Photo-essay “Maps of Grief” is a look into the harsh terrains of human grief – it being our intimate and most direct experience. The barren landscape of grief stays unspoiled by time. Unmoved. Untouched. Unaffected. It becomes a solitary yet solid ground for its unprepared visitor in an ever-changing and unpredictable ebb of life.",
