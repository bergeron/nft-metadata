    "description": "A unique animation of a bookplate made by Mark F. Severin, opus 274 (1973). \n'Urania Fastuosa L.'\nThe original work is a paper print made from an engraving on a copper plate.\nMark Severin was a Belgian artist (1906 - 1987) that made around 500 bookplates (ex-libris) engraved in wood, copper or steel.\nHis art is influenced by the beauty of nature and women.\nHe is considered as one of the best engravers of the 20th century. \nThe animation is made by Ronny Mark Makepeace Severin, grandson of Mark F. Severin.\nIt is ode to my grandfather, a mutation of his art into something vitual and alive.",
