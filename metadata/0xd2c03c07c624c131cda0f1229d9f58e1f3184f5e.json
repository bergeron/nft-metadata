    "description": "\"Temporary\" is a thought-provoking collection of post-photographic images that delves into the emotional journey of grief. Through a visual representation of the five stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance - this collection offers a unique perspective on the complexity of human emotions. Each stage is expressed through visual storytelling and the carefully crafted use of color – aimed to encourage and inspire individuals to connect with their own emotions and seek comfort in the knowledge that they are not alone on their journey.\n\n\n\n Year: 2023\n\nEdition: NFT 1 of 1\n\nCopyright: © 2023 Julie Wieland.
