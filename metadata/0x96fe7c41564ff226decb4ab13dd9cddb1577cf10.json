    "description": "Original Max sketch, circa December 2016.\n\nThis is a digitized image of the first hand-drawn sketch of Max the Miata. Inspired by David's love for driving in his convertible roadster, Max represents an eternal optimism about meeting life's many challenges.\n\nWhen he first created Max, David had no grand ambitions for the character. However, in January 2017, David began illustrating short webcomics starring Max—now in vector form—and chronicling the typical car ownership experience.\n\nIn 2021, David jumped fully into the web3 space and began expanding Max's world beyond a simple cartoon car and into a magical universe filled with colorful creatures and wondrous locales.\n\nTo date, David has created 20 collections on OpenSea's shared contract. As a big step forward in his creative journey, this NFT is the first-ever created on David's own contract.",
