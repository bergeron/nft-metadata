    "description": "The world moves around him like he does not exist. He might be invisible to others but the boy seems wonderstruck by what he sees. It is a world he does not belong to. The boy seems so mesmerized by the dazzle and pace of the world around him that he is unmindful of even the food packet some good soul had placed near him. \nI found the boy at Connaught Place, a super rich business hub in New Delhi. The boy belongs to a gypsy family. His mother was seen nearby, selling peanuts and cheap toys for a living. His five elder siblings, all of whom should ideally have been in school, were also roaming around the street half-naked, mostly begging for food. \nThere are over 22 crore people in India who just about survive with less than â‚¹32 a day. This boy's mother earns far less on most days.",
