    "description": "The day after Martina's birthday (Milan, 2021)\n4584 × 6112\n\nThis image is part of my series of Fridgescapes, which depicts fridges' interiors in Italy, where I live, and in other places around the world. \nI love to talk about food and to take photos in other people's houses. Fridge seems a private space, but when I ask to photograph it no one ever says no.\nIt very interesting to look at all the details, the food stored, the sauces and drinks, and imagine people's life.\n\nI did this photo the day after Martina's birthday in our home in Milano.",
