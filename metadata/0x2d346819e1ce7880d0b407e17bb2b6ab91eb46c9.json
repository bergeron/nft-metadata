    "name": "Charle Ray's Psychedelic Trip",
    "description": "In a visit to Pompideu Museum, I found Charles Ray \"Self-Portrait\" so inspirational that I started following his whole work. \n\nI read Anthony Marasco noted his work as paratextual: or, paraphrasing Genett: “meaningful deceptions”: deceptions that engender meaning by overdriving interpretation.\"\n\nAs a Techno philosopher and artist myself. I found AI tools like the best choice to manifest this idea. Since I walked into that gallery, I felt bedazzled by the scenery and I read that he -Charles Ray- liked psychedelics as part of his experimentation. \n\nThe idea here was to actually represent this meaningful deception, this overdriven interpretation, using a fictional landscape where this statue or three-dimensional self-portrait would inhabit.\n\nI used Dalle-2 for the prompt, GIMP to edit some chaotic things & a post process filter.\n\n1/1.",
