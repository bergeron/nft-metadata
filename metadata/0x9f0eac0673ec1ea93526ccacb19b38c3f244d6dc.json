    "description": "Happy Holidays & all that Jazz.\n\nBackstory:\nCreated & Released on December 23rd, 2010.\nProduced by Dutchyyy\n\n\nThe title of this track comes from the blog I used to run. \"The Hobbyshop Hero\" Originally Launched in 2006, I think my last post was 2011. Focused on highlighting music, toys, videogames, streetwear, collectables...  You know, Nerd Stuff. \n\nhttps://thehobbyshophero.blogspot.com \n\nI definitely miss the blog era.  As a creative and A collector, it was a dope way to share inspiration. While my blog might be super dated, and this song is super dated, The sentiment of being grateful & the spirit of collecting and sharing inspiration is eternal.  I thought it was a good day to solidify a little ghost of Xmas past on blockchain to live forever. \n\nLove, Light & All that Jazz.\n\nSincerely, Dutch \n12.25.22",
