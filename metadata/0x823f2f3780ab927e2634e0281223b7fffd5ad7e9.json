    "description": "\"Stay true\" from the series \"Spontaneous thoughts\" opens up a door to another zone, in which all the elements set in the area are reminding you something; to be you and stay true, cause that is the very unique gift we're all given.\n\nwhere is the door located then? I believe there are thousands of universes deeply hiding in our thoughts, and every single of them is worth opening. that's what we'll look at in the SPON collection.\n\nAcrylics on canvas 40×80\nJpeg file 2466×5023\n\nOne edition [cause no more than one individual is allowed to see behind the door at the same time!]",
