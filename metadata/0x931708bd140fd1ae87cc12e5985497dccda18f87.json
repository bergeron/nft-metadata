    "description": "In Barbara Graham's mugshot, no less than Barbara Kruger's slogans, we are both brute and brutalized, staring defiantly in, gazing defiantly out. Here the image is eminently didactic. This is an image that serves; it serves the state, it serves the police, it serves systems of incarceration, of measurement, of commerce, of categorisation, of judgement, of plain calculating reason. \"Good people always think they're right\" she warns us. Below bruise and execution, love is a ransom.\n[Between The Known And The Unknown Is The Eye] (https://hooliganstreetpoetry.org/between-the-known-photograph-as-document-photograph-as-dream/)",
