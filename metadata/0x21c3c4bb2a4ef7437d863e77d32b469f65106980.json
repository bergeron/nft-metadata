    "description": "This work was influenced by two simultaneously occurred events: the celebration of Halloween and the day of the official implementation of the QR code rule in Russia.  I have applied makeup and created the look for the Halloween party that at the same time could be used as a QR code to enter that party. \n This work is a part of the «DUMMY DANDY» project (Extreme self-portrait).\nDummy Dandy – is an art-identity of our era of the cult of avatar, selfie in-dependence, real virtuality.\nIdea, photo, props, make-up, model - Liza Dandy\n",
