    "description": "HUMAN MOMENTS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE\n\nIf you could see the image within the darker areas of this art piece, that means you have an artist's eyes. \n\nI didnâ€™t know what to expect from this impression at first. All I hope was to create an art piece full of human moments. It took me almost a month to go through hundreds of the best photographs from my black and white human imageries. No darkening of any areas, but by studying the tones, fully arranged by hand. Suddenly, a figure popped up and I saw a human head. I felt the amazed by my unexpected accomplishment.\n\nSize: 12795px by 12795px (1.3 meters square)",
