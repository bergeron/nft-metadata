Yes, he isn't one of the good guys. \n\nKandor seeks to enslave the magic realm and replace humans with gargoyles, his favourite. He's amassed power from all the dragons he has slain, powerful magic that would enable him bring in unspeakable creatures from the Netherrealm. \n\nThis is not a story with a happy ending. Kandor is simply too powerful to be defeated, he even tamed death.",
