    "description": "He locks her in a golden cage to protect her from fears and horrors. \nHe forgets that the cage itself is a test. It breaks her essence. \n\nIn the beginning, he watches her closely. Later the shackles become her continuation. \nAnd “the bird” doesn’t leave the cage even when the door  is opened. \n\nYes, love is crazy and sometimes cruel. \nBut we always expect it with a warm heart.\n\n5000x5000px",
