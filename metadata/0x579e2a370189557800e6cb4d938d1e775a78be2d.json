    "description": "\"Man is a fascinating creature with many facets, but what brings us all together is this need for love and recognition.\"\n\nThis ongoing series illustrates the complex relationships that unite human beings.\nWe are social beings, we need others to survive and thrive. Human relationships are fundamental to our emotional and physical well-being, and we are instinctively drawn to others.\n\nBut beyond our physical needs, love and recognition are deep human needs. Love can take many forms, whether it be romantic love, maternal or paternal love, friendship, self-love or even love for a cause, a passion or even a spiritual love. It is a universal need that we all share, regardless of our age, gender or culture. It is this love which will remain our most beautiful heritage and which will survive us as long as these links which we have created in this life will remain in the memory of those who remain.",
