    "description": "‘Better When We’re Close’ started as a jazzy idea that Casey Butler and I cooked up in my bedroom last year, and I immediately felt that it was the perfect start to a Brijean collab given their jazz backgrounds and sound.\n\nI sent it to them and they sent back something completely different that still retained the original feel, the start of a very exciting back-and-forth that involved Casey adding sax and flute, me adding vocals and production and a slow, collaborative orchestration build out.\n\nWhat we ended up with is a song that feels distinctly Brijean and distinctly Poolside that feels like the platonic ideal of a collaboration between us.\n\nI’m super proud of this one and hope that you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it!\n\n- Jeffrey aka Poolside",
