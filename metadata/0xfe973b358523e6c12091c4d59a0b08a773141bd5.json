    "description": "Volcán de Fuego (Volcano of Fire) is a very active volcano in Guatemala.\n\nMyself and a local guide geared up and set out from Antigua to the trailhead and began our hike to see this spectacular volcano.\n\nIt was by no means an easy feat to reach the summit of the nearby Volcán Acatenango (6 hours incline) but it was 110% worth it. I was welcomed with an incredible 360-degree at the top (3,976 meters above sea level) and from here I experienced a close encounter with the neighboring Volcán de Fuego.\n\nFrom the viewpoint, I could hear, see, and feel all the elements of Volcán de Fuego and I captured this photograph during one of its eruptions.\n\nArtist: Jonny Melon\nLocation: Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala\nYear: 2019\nEdition 1/1\n\nLicense: Extended Editorial (if further licensing is required please contact the artist)",
