    "description": "This event, taken just hours ago, is a piece of history, it marks a phenomenon that doesn't happen very often. \n\nI was so pleased the skies cleared and let me capture this eclipse!\n\nYou won't often see me taking images of the moon, it usually stops me imaging the Milky Way, but this event had to be recorded!\n\nI have set this auction at a low price, to give everyone a chance to bid, including all my wonderful Twitter frens.\n\nI shot this from my home in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n",
