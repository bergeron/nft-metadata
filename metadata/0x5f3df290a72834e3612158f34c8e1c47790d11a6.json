    "name": "Rayle's Beginning ",
    "description": "This place deserves such an end.\n\nRayle thought as he looked over the cliff, his eyes taking in a sight that was all too foreign to him.\nUnnatural light, tall structures, metal, rock and glass. No trees or nature or running water to be seen. It looked like a hell, a place where people go when they have failed their Gods. When no glory, great deeds or battlefield victories have been achieved.\n\nHe looked down at his kin crowded and huddled in small areas, their frail necks turned down at their hands, horns and yelling of angry men on the streets and the screams and horrors that you can only witness in the night.\n\n\"These are failed beings.\" Rayle said to himself, filling with anger.\n\nHe does not know how he got here but in his mind he knew what must be done.\n\nThe Dragons await his call.
