    "description": "This NFT was inspired by the golden days of the pixel era. I think none of us will forget those incredible days behind the Super Nintendo, when we were glued to the screen. \n\nDo you remember the last game you played? \n\nI bet you never imagined that was the last time you played it.. The very last time â€¦\n\nThey say that in order to create you have to destroy, kill your darlings, this is a tribute to that.\n\nI hope you enjoy this crazy trip with me.\n\n( The genesis owner will get the non-explosive version NFT for free ! )",
