    "description": "On a sunny morning in October 2022, I was walking through the streets of Cologne towards the main train station. \n\nThe sun was starting to come up and struck the face of this building. \n\nThe \"Maredo\" letters cast their long shadows that drew me in immediately. \n\nThis is my first collaboration, and I had the pleasure of welcoming Sixstreetunder to assist with the editing. \n\nArtists: DracheTech11 & Sixstreetunder\n\nEdition 1/1\n\nLicense\n\nExtended Editorial: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
