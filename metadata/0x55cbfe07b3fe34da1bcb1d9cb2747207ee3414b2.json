    "description": "This is a slightly strange story of you and Yama. One day, while wandering in the forest, you stumbled upon a small, secluded cabin. Inside, you found a mysterious figure named Yama, who claimed to have been living alone in the cabin for as long as he could remember. Despite his reclusive nature, Yama welcomed you into his home and the two of you spent many days exploring the surrounding woods and sharing stories by the fire. But as the days passed, you began to notice that Yama's behavior was becoming increasingly erratic and he would often disappear for hours at a time. Eventually, you discovered that Yama was not human, but a spirit who had been bound to the cabin for centuries. Realizing that he could never leave, you made the difficult decision to leave Yama and return to the outside world, but you could never forget the time you spent with the strange and wonderful spirit known as Yama.",
