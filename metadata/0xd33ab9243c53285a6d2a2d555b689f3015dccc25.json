    "description": "She pointed at them and said, \"These birds fly from Siberia.\" I nodded as if I understood. \"It is so cold that they can't live there.\" She continued explaining, but I didn't concentrate on what she was saying. I planned to tell her how I was feeling.\n\"I wish I could migrate like a bird. Go wherever I want,\" she said with the eyes revealing that she was thinking about something. I knew it because I always glanced at her.\n\"But they need to migrate\"\n\"I need to. I'd also like to move to a warmer place.\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Anywhere, far away from here.\"\n\"Because of people around you?\"\n\"Yep.\"\nI didn't tell her anything I wanted. I was not brave enough, and it was the last time I saw her.\nShe is no longer here, but I am. I remember her and how I felt that day.\nI saw her post on Instagram, wearing many layers of sweaters, and taking selfies with a snowman. I know it was freezing there, yet her smile and the sparkle in her eyes are brighter and warmer than being in a tropical country like this.\n",
