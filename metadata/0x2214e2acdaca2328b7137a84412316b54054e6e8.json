    "description": "The wise man says we are part of the universe, we are a microcosm of the macrocosm. Human wisdom is an encyclopedic knowledge of all things. Through the senses, human apprehends the sensible world, through the intellect, human gains entry into the celestial realm of pure intelligence. \nEverything must be in balance. As long as evil and good maintain an equilibrium state of mind, no one side is allowed to \"win\" too much. Cause without darkness there is no light.\nBalance and harmony are the keys to life.\n-Bonaventura A Paramarastu\n\n\nIllustration : MeldaVNH's #dtiys from Bona's Artwork",
