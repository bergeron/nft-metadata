    "description": "The creation of man and reindeer.\n\nReindeer herders can roam more than 1000km a year. They go forward submitted to the hunger of the reindeer.  This way of life has already been several thousands years old. But how did the reindeer herders appear in the North? With purchasing the photo, you will get a personal detailed myth from Evens on how the man and reindeer landed on Earth from the sky. \n\nTo every collector I am also open to have a call and tell more about the lifestyle or myths of indigenous people of the North.",
