    "description": "I love trees, I think they are like people.\nSome have many friends, some trees are lonely, each tree has a special personality.\nIn this collection, I want to show lonely trees, many of these trees that you see in this collection are from years ago, and many of them were cut down by humans and no longer exist.\nEvery time I passed by this tree, it was full of sparrows, until one day I passed by and saw that the tree was cut down, tears gathered in my eyes.\nBut I was happy to take a picture of this tree and its memory will always stay with me",
