    "description": "(part one of seven)\n\n‘Zevenluik' (Heptalogy) is a series of seven inextricably linked artworks. A study of harmony, composition, order, dynamics and interference.\n\nEach work in the series is part of a larger whole. By reuniting the separate parts side by side in the correct order, they connect seamlessly in shape and movement, and form the complete work of art ‘Zevenluik'. The implicit assignment of the overarching work of art is therefore to reassemble the seven works and restore the mutual coherence.\n\nTechnical specifications:\n— 40 second seamless loop\n— 30 fps\n— H.264 mp4 video\n— 2160 x 2160 pixels\n",
