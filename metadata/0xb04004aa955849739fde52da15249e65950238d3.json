    "description": "Story: My entire life I lived in a small town afraid of change up until 8 years ago when on a whim I moved to Toronto after my father passed away. He was a photographer who gave me my very first camera at 10 years old. I think my dad dying lit a fire inside of me to see the world and chase my dreams because he died young and never got to do this for himself. Every sleepless night out with my camera chasing these beautiful moments, this is for you dad. Even though you are no longer around I can finally say to myself I didn't give up and I kept chasing my dreams because of the strength that lives inside of me thanks to you. Never give up on your Street Dreams my friends...",
