    "description": "As one hides, the other must seek. Ladybugs play a large role in protecting crops by seeking tiny plant-eating insects that hide within the depths of nature itself and voraciously consuming them, as well as laying hundreds of eggs within the colonies of their prey. Thus being an immediate feeding frenzy for the newly hatched Ladybugs.\n\nThis piece was captured on the 26th of August 2021 within the stunning countryside haven of Clent Hills, Birmingham, UK. To be at such a superior view point, yet have the ability due to the human eye to notice such miniscule movement, I can say that I was really blessed with an opportunity that could not be missed.\n\n#1 buyer will receive the 1/1 NFT edition original photo, printed on the finest Hahnem√ºhle FineArt Baryta paper and placed within a Tobacco coloured wooden frame. This will also come with a Certificate of Authentication and signature on the back of the frame.\n\nPrint Size (cm) : 90 x 37.6\nFull Frame Size (cm) : 122.7 x 70.3",
