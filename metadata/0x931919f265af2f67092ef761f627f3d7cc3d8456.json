    "description": "We live trapped in a box. What is the box? The box is nothing more than your comfort zone, they are the limitations that you have imposed on yourself that have not allowed you to grow as a human being, have limited you and make you generate feelings of fear towards the new, the unknown, causing the creativity that we have inside does not come to light. Free your mind, fight and get out of that box, generate emotions of confidence and illusion, don't get used to feeling limited, reinvent yourself every day.",
