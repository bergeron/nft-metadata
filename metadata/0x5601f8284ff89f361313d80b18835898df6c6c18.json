    "description": "In life, we all have our burdens. Maybe not always, and maybe not for long stretches of time.\n\nBut there are times in our lives where it can feel like the entire world is a chaotic mess of troubles, all battling for the chance to bring you pain.\n\nFinancial debts, marital issues, workforce displacement, depression, criticism, loss... \n\nSometimes, we have no choice but to weather the storm surrounding us and take the blows. Reality spins and leaves you unsteady. You struggle to find focus on a single thing as your mind whirs and shuts down from the anxiety of finding a first step towards resolution.\n\nThough we all face these moments, it is important to remember we all also have the strength and ability to endure and press forward towards a better life. \n\nDespite the seemingly insurmountable struggles ahead, we must survive the turmoil.",
