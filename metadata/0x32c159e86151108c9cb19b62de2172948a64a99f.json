    "description": "Humanity's pursuit of technological progress leads to the creation of a god that surpasses itself. \n\nHowever, humans soon realize that this deity cannot bring true happiness and fulfillment, but rather makes them feel smaller and weaker. As a result, they rise up against their creation, but are inevitably crushed. \n\nFinally, humanity humbly kneels before their creation, showing reverence to the god, and also pays tribute to Mother Earth with gratitude and humility."
