I love you\".\n\nWe worked with him on confidence, talking about  mental fragility and the point of being distinctive and different. We are still talking about self-acceptance and self-care and love.\n\nThis work has been published in a PhotoVogue in February 2022. \n\nLICENCES: NFT holder is free to use in virtual galleries with all credit information.
