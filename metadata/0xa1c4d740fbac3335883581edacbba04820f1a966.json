    "description": "This sculpture embodies the intriguing juxtaposition of time and technology, a central concept in our collaboration with Botto. Despite its appearance as an ancient ruin, the sculpture features a human holding a landline telephone, revealing its creation and abandonment within the 20th century. The frozen moment in time and its uncanny reflection of contemporary technology served as inspiration for our Botto collaboration. Our aim was to evoke a similar sensation in the artwork, where Botto fragments seamlessly blend into the interior frames yet subtly deviate from the architectural style, whilst hinting at the presence of AI.",
