    "description": "One of my most popular artworks ever created, combines two of my most favorite things about Japan:\n\nMagnificent Deer of Nara (ancient capital of Japan) deemed to be sacred and \n\nThe first time I ever saw a truly mesmerizing view of thousands of Fireflies hovering over the river close to a magnificent ancient shrine. I felt almost like Kami (Shinto Gods) decided to reveal themselves.",
