    "name": "Andre Derain,Charing Cross Bridge #1/3",
    "description": "Andre Derain painted ‘Charing Cross Bridge’ during his brief stay of two months in London, England, in the winter of 1906. The painting depicts a scene from the south shores of the river Thames, as the artist observed it while standing on a wharf near the Lion’s Brewery, which is the blue building on the far left. The rippling water effect was achieved by using short, choppy brush strokes. The distant buildings and landscape were painted employing smooth, soft lines in order to create a contrast with the close, sharp contours in the foreground. The bridge shows the train driving through it. ‘Charing Cross Bridge’ remains one of Derain’s most popular paintings.",
