    "description": "We've all been struggling to maintain our sanity for a long time due to all the problems that Covid had made. After all of these struggles and now that we all have been reaching a state of relaxation, the world is getting into war and WWIII is something pretty probable at this point. I'm just struggling to stay sane like I've been doing since Covid started and I hope all of you find peace and love in these hard times.\n\nThis piece is a recreation of myself as a llama meditating among all the crazy things happening around me. It's a llama because no matter what happens to a llama, they always stay calm.\n\nThis piece is a fully 3D piece and everything you see in it is entirely made in 3D.\n\nResolution: 2676x4000\n\nSoftwares used: Cinema 4D, Redshift Render Engine, X-particles, Marvelous Designer, Zbrush, Substance Painter\n",
