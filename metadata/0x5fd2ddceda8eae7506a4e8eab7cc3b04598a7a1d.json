    "description": "A forest fairy fell in love with a man\nWho left her for another's hand\nLonely and brokenhearted, she cursed him \nBut it cost her her soul\n\nOnly a child with gentle hands\nAnd a heart to change the world\nCould lift the curse \nAnd return her soul to the forest\nWhere her resting stone lay\nA thousand years late\n",
