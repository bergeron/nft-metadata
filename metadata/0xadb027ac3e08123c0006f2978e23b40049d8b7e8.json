    "description": "We live surrounded by useful things. There is no object within our reach that does not have any kind of utility. That's why it's normal that in recent times, in our space, the same question has arisen time and time again: where is the utility of art?\n\nEngineers and entrepreneurs work on the utility of things, on the functioning of the systems that make our lives easier. But this is not the work of artists.\n\nArt has the duty to go deeper. It denounces the idea that everything has to be measured by its usefulness. Art invites us for a few minutes to reflect on objects for what they are… and us for who we are.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to ask the opposite question to “where is the utility of art?”. It takes useful objects and banishes them from their field of utility just to ask us: and now… where is the value of these useless objects?\n\nThis project tries to remind us that the beauty of things lies precisely in their freedom of meaning, in their forgotten mystery, in their resistance of being used.\n\nThis is my new concept: “The resistance”. And I am very glad to share it with you",
