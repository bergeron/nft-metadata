    "description": "**Artist:** Gary Hill\n\n**Title:** CC\n\n**Artist Proof:** 1 of 1\n\nCC carries forward Gary Hill’s exploration of the concept of value as medium of exchange initiated in his project Frustrum (2006), first exhibited at Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Paris. Part of the artwork was a solid gold bar weighing twelve kilograms, engraved with the Gnostic proverb-like statement, “FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS VISIBLE IS A COPY OF THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN.” The bar was stolen in 2007. As Le Monde reported, three masked thieves entered the foundation during the night, tied up the security guard, and got away with the gold bar as well as the cashbox. CC features the glass mold used to cast the original gold bar. It has the same inscription and is displayed with a video piece relating to Frustrum and the theft of the gold bar. The video and the bar interact as part of the installation, sometimes catching a golden hue.\n\n\n**Website:** https://www.shiftingvision.org/",
