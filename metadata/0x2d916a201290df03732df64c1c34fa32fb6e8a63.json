    "description": "Riley experienced a brain aneurysm on Thanksgiving 2022, and has been living without a large piece of his skull for the last two months. Through the help of friends and family, we've created a small NFT collection that will serve as a fundraiser for his 1st and 2nd surgeries.  He is currently undergoing surgery to remove the AVM and replace his skull.",
