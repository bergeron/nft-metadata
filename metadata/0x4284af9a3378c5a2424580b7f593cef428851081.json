    "description": "David Nobody, your Cybernetic Butler is a pretty penny. A Fountain Of Pennies From Heaven pours down on this poor soul, catch it if you can! 30,000 pennies were rained upon him. A Penny saved is a Penny earned, so keep this lucky charm in your wallet for better times ahead! This piece is an edition of 99 meant to be affordable, like Penny stock. It was made as part of the Upside Down World solo show at 11 Newel St gallery in Brooklyn, curated by Coco Dolle. This piece is the 5th performance art NFT in the show, all of which were installed in an upside down Butler's Quarters in our collective burned out mansion.",
