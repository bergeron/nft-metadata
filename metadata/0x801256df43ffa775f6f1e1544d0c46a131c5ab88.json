    "description": "On August 5th, 2022, I captured this picture at 6am ET in Seaview, Fire Island. It has not been edited or touched up. \n\nWhat do you see: The sun or the surroundings? \n\nThis was a simple question once posed to me and I saw the sun. In my answer, I realized I was missing the bigger picture.\n\n100% of the Primary Sales from this piece will be donated to New York Cares \"Stand with Students\" - the largest citywide initiative to help Title I schools.",
