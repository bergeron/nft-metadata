    "description": "Looking around the world today, we see conflicts that threaten peace.I created this work with the hope that the conflict will subside as soon as possible.The name of the work, Frontier, means \"Ukraine\" in Slavic language, which represents a border or frontier region.Many butterflies appear in the work. In the West, butterflies are considered a symbol of resurrection.The glowing butterflies fluttering down to the blue frontier are a prayer for restoration, for the return of peace and tranquility to Ukraine as soon as possible.\n\nThis work has not only NFT art, but also physical art (original painting) separately.\nThis work exists not only as NFT art, but also as a separate reproduction. (There is a plan to issue up to 10 reproductions with serial numbers to be sold separately.)\nOnly this one piece of NFT will exist.\nThe copyright of this work is held by \"Peter and Joseph\" and the creators of the work, Makoto Tagawa and Shinya Fukasawa.\nThis NFT may not be used for commercial purposes.",
