    "description": "I think life is like walking in a labyrinth\nThere are many paths to choose from\nEach path has many intersections\nThe path you choose may be the right one\nOr maybe it's the wrong path\nYou never know until you hit a dead end\nIt can be a rough and time-consuming journey\nOr maybe it's a shorter and smoother way to reach the exit\nMany people are lost in a labyrinth their whole lives\nJust to wait for the light at the end\nto lead us out of this labyrinth",
