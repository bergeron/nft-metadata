    "description": "Through the Looking Glass\n\n1/1\njpeg, 3024 x 4032\n\n\nWhile washing brushes a wavering self portrait emerges through the cloudy water and residue of paint. A soothing jazz of running water and bird song is a sweet accompaniment.\n\nSome of the most beautiful images I see are in the transient and ephemeral moments of beauty that occur in the process of creating another work. The ‘Aesthetica’ Collection captures, preserves and shares the aesthetic experience of painting that is usually intimately private. Through digital photography, these fleeting images of aesthetic delight become artworks in their own right. No IRL artefact exists outside of these works as they are destroyed as quickly as they are created, painted over in palimpsest, subsumed into another work or washed away. Through this collection, my audience are invited to share in the spontaneous visual pleasure found in the process of painting, which is perhaps for me, the greatest motivating aspect of artistic creation itself.  \n",
