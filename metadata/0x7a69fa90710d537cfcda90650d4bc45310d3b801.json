    "description": "Dance To Our Future is a part of our on-going collection 'Backtopoints Loops'. This collection reflects on our love of works based on basic loops using lots of 3d modelling and simulation techniques. The works in this collection don't reflect just a specific subject matter, theme and motifs but revolve around a lot of different contents. Since we do not yet know the exact content of the collection, that is, how many artworks will eventually make the collection, it's more like a life-time artistic pursuit, experiment and of course joy in the first place.\n\nhttps://backtopoints.com/works/collections/backtopoints-loops",
