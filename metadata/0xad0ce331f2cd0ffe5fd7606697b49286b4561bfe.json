      "0xAI Genesis: 3450 stunning 1-of-1 artworks generated in the symbiosis of humans and AI, inspired by the Renaissance and its focus on the intersection of science & art. After 7 months of non-stop prompt engineering, over 40,000 image generations were delicately distilled down to a scarce curation. 3450 Genesis pieces will ever exist. \n\n The artworks are not only visually appealing but also thought-provoking, as they encourage us to contemplate the consequences of the development of AI and the significance of preserving our humanity in the process. The collection entails 45 traits, 7 of which are created in official collaboration with highly regarded NFT projects such as the Museum of Crypto Art, Forgotten Runes & more."
