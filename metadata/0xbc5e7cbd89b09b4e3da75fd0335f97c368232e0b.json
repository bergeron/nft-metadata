    "description": "What is Body Image? Body Image is a combination of the thoughts and feelings that you have about your body. Body Image can be negative or positive. A person with a negative body image may feel self-conscious or ashamed, and may feel that others are more attractive. In a time where social media holds a very important place and is used frequently in our daily lives.  \nHave you ever embraced yourself in your arms full of love?  \nDon't let the outside world make you think there is something wrong with your body.  \nLove yourself for who you are and the body you have for you're not just your body. You are the universe and all beauties.\n\nBy Mahnaz Rasouli, 2023",
