    "description": "This photograph was taken by my father in 1971 during a US Coast Guard expedition to the North Pole. He was the medic on board, and documented the voyage in photographs.\n\nHe passed away this autumn, and I've spent a lot of time lately sorting through and scanning his old slides. This image isn't festive – alas, they didn't stumble on Santa's workshop! – but it makes me reflect on the way that memories, like film, decay and change over time. It's also uplifting to consider the human drive to seek out adventure, and our capacity to reinvent ourselves year after year.\n\nI hope you find some inspiration here, too, and that the new year brings many adventures and discoveries your way.\n\n* Minted for the 2022 Habibis Holiday Exchange.",
