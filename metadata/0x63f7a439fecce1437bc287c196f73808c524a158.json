    "description": "Colossal is from the series Geomorphology.\n\nThis series is about the perpetual evolution of the earthâ€™s crust, a surface compressed and manipulated by geological force and by the elements of water, wind and heat. From shifting tectonic plates and volcanic eruptions, to a drip of water imperceptibly carving through rock, these seemingly static formations are actually in permanent flux.\n\nGeomorphology visualises the latent energy stored in these layers of minerals. Here the monolithic rock formations represent a history of geographical evolution. The opaque pools that form within this Illusory landscape are charged with energy and possibility, alluring portals that reach out to an uncharted terrain.",
