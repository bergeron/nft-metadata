    "description": "There is an euphoric melody playing in the night sky, almost as if it is luring me to come closer. I can see my mother's traditional Bengali art, alpona, being made on the starry canvas outside our house.\n\nWhereas in reality, everything is disconnected and chaotic, I see the canvas as seamlessly integrating everything and everyone. Consequently, the sky is an extension of mine, and I am an extension of yours as well. As I slumber quietly, the sound of nature's symphony fills the air around me.",
