    "description": "This artwork is a meeting with Ferdowsi, Nezami Ganjavi and Saadi Shirazi, three of the greatest persian poets. The characters are taken from ancient Iranian stories and poems to create a new love story. Of course, in the meantime, we are attracted by details: the use of motifs such as the iPhone and the tie in the design of oriental characters that show the contrast between the modern and traditional worlds. It is designed all by hand and painted with gouache.",
