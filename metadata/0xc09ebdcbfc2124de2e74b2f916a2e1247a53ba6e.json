    "description": "Towering above the surrounding countryside, the mountain stands tall, silent and powerful as the light from a billion suns rises behind its' majestic peak. The only sound to be heard is that of the icy waters carving their way to the sea from the jagged valleys above.\n\nNamed Taranaki Maunga by the native Maori, this mountain is a deeply spiritual place for all who live under itsâ€™ shadow and to those who come to hike its' many trails.\n\nI have spent many months wandering and searching for the perfect image of my mountain with the rising milky-way galaxy 'erupting' above. \n\nFinally capturing my dream image here after all that planning, is an absolutely priceless feeling.\n\nAuction winner receives a Fine Art Print.\n\n\nAbout me:\nMy name is Larryn, an adventurer and astrophotographer from New Zealand. I have a relentless hunger for capturing the art of the night from incredible locations. My passion has taken me to some amazing places, won me several awards and created life long friendships.",
