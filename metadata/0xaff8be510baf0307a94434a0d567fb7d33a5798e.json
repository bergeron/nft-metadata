    "description": "Some moments feel like nothing short of a dream. \n\n  After 5 hours of broken sleep at this spot hoping for the freezing fog to lift, this 3am scene was breathtaking. In a break between rime ice covered trees sat a small Canadian town, covered in a blanket of fog with a delicate aurora gently pulsing above. A magic moment that made me realize that having faith, determination, and a voracity for the sublime can be worth all the discomfort to get there.  \n\nAbout the piece:\n\nA picture can only evoke so much. Here, I wanted to encapsulate the feeling of being in this moment. The gently falling ice flakes in the air, the subtle breeze blowing away the fog, the shifting moonlight shadows, and the nearby great horned owl calling for a partner. All these sights and sounds I captured that morning. All in the frozen peacefulness of a sleeping world with a cyan aurora gently dancing above.\n",
