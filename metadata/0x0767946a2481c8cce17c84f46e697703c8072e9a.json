    "description": "Swan Boat Supreme channels the blooming green waters of Colombo, Sri Lanka's Beira Lake as a canvas for symbols of national identity.  \nThe swan boat is primarily a vehicle for 'lovers' - those engaged in activities deemed un-social - to paddle away where they'll drift until their return (presumably eating nevermelting ice-cream). But it's really an ode to the scallywags and hoodlums pushing back for a better future. To those who dare to question the precious status quo of subservient mediocrity. \nThe shapes will be obvious to those who see the symbolism. They might be referred to as geometric violations of the sanctity of the ideals of the nation. Their existence, in original form, is to reflect, honour but also pigeonhole. There are imperfections left in the work - two large floating leaves that must remain no matter how the itch to spot-remove calls. This is the fabric, and citizens paddle along across the verticals and horizontals - with and against tides seen and unseen. \nThe question however remains as to whether the boat is occupied.",
