    "description": "Adri Mukund collaborated with photographer Cryptogodnaman to create a unique NFT as part of the Cryptogod's World 2.0: Fusion of Photography x NFT project. Cryptogod's World is a collaboration of over 150 artists and photographers, bringing together the worlds of photography and art to create one-of-a-kind 1/1 fusion NFTs.\n\nAdri chose a picture from the CG Photography Vault that resembled a computer motherboard and turned it into an artwork using the concept of \"mother-bird.\" After creating a small illustration of the bird's head and adding a baby bird illustration next to the main bird, he recomposed the entire artwork to give it the look of a basic motherboard. The resulting artwork was then minted as an NFT as part of the Cryptogod's World 2.0 project. The canvas dimensions that Adri used for his artwork were 6400 * 9600.\n\nFor more information on this exciting collaboration and to view the complete workflow for Adri's artwork, visit Adri's socials!",
