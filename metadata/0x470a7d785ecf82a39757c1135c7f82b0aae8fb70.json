With an area of 4,000 square meters, this building dates back to the pre-Islamic periods. This fort was used to defend against the invasion of the Mongols and other enemies, which they say later became a place of bandits and insurgents. After Bam Citadel, Karshahi Castle is the largest brick building in Iran. This historical monument was registered on June 16, 2002, with registration number 5891 as one of the national monuments of Iran.",
