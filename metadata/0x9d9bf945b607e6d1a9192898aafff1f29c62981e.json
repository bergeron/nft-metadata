    "description": "About Photo: I love this photo because it reminds me how powerful yet so insignificant humans are in this world. This photo is from Jan 2021 when I was on a Himalayan trek. As we were getting ready to move forward for our 3rd stretch of the trek, I saw this beautiful mountain. The peak was shining so good and I instantly got the idea what I wanted to shoot. I asked my friend to pose and I got this shot.\n\nArtist Name: Sachin Chauhan\n\nEdition: 1/1\nSize: 3424x4280\nLocation: Uttarakhand, India",
