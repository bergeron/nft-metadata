    "description": "Jenny, the model I created, is happy to dance in a place dedicated to her. Her gigantic portrait, a large mosaic, a large stained glass window, frames her graceful movements. The soft light is projected on the statues of girls in the center of the room, drawing prehistoric figures on their bodies. She is aware of being the center of attention and her dance movements are as light as those of a butterfly that has a large mirror behind her, the portrait I made for her, as she listens to Track Tribe's \"Busy City\" thanks to YouTube",
