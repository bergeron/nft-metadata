    "description": "Banksy’s A Ghost is a signature GucciGhost piece by Trevor Andrew created specifically for Particle in response to Banksy’s Love is in the Air. Andrew takes a whimsical and lighthearted take on Banksy’s iconic image - even the title points to a clever reference to Banksy’s anonymity. The artist's signature Casper-esque ghost, which he states as being “part of his DNA to tell stories”, reimagines a classic moment of the GucciGhost story, where the caricature is seen with a pan in his hand tossing up an egg, in a work entitled “ Life is Scary Sometimes.” Andrew revisits this moment by replacing the pan and egg with a stenciled rendition of LIITA’s bouquet, an instantly recognizable symbol of peace, beauty, and hope that Banksy used to disarm both his viewers and his figures' opponent. The whole piece is branded with Gucci insignia from a vintage found fabric, which Andrew felt was a “fun way for each holder to have a moment.”",
