This NFT belongs to the Children of the Cosmos, a collection originally minted on the Tezos blockchain. \n~  \nEach one of us is a child of the cosmos. Born, raised, and buried on a rock orbiting the sun. Our earthly bodies are composed of stardust particles that originated from the heavens above. It is our destiny to return there. From dust we came and to dust we shall return.",
