    "description": "SEASON I\nThe series centers on the ephemeral, cyclical, and ceaseless qualities of life.\n\nLIFE IS EPHEMERAL.\nA precise, delicate balance of criteria is required for life to exist and persist. In the cosmic context, life as we know it is profoundly brief. On the individual level, life is nearly consequential relative to the universe’s existence.\n\nLIFE IS CYCLICAL.\nFrom the macro to the micro, life repeats, reflects, and rhymes. Cosmic rotations, seasons, days. Organisms, communities, societies, species. Sociological and psychological trends rhyme. Over, and over, and over.\n\nLIFE IS CEASELESS.\nEphemeral phases beget ephemeral phases in seemingly unending cycles. Sequential cycles layered infinitely. Each cycle bleeding into the next. Ephemeral at the micro while ceaseless on the macro. Despite its ephemeral characteristics, life is resilient. It is both beautiful and terrifying in its ceaselessness.",
