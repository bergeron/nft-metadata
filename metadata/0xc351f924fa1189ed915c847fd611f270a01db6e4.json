    "description": "Complexity beyond human comprehension. What motivates people to do this or that? Live/survive? And the meaning, if the outcome of all this is already clear. Excessive fatigue. The brain is oppressed by these thoughts of the observer. The worst thing is that all this does not exist and this is just a mistake of everything that exists. Or is there someone behind this, so who is he? God?\nA hostage in the midst of utopia and dystopia. Everything will be clear when there is absolute calmness in matter. The process will someday stop and nothing will happen.\nOut of understanding, the only way out is to observe what is happening. There is no structure or order in the world other than what we create ourselves. Everything habitual possesses only the germinated fruit of existence itself. There is no truth; any belief in something true is a lie. Chaos of deceptive reality.\n\n1/8",
