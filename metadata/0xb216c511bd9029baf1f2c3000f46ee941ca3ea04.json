    "description": "Captured in the northern Yukon, three seasons can be seen in this single image. \n\nOnce upon a time this photo went viral on Reddit and several other platforms, receiving thousands of comments arguing about whether or not Photoshop was used to create the unique scene. \n\nThe truth is that I don't composite any of my work and this is a single image, shot with a massive telephoto lens from halfway up a neighboring mountain. Taken just on the cusp of winter, a lone tamarack larch sits abnormally high on the ridge of evergreens. While an incoming snowstorm can be seen coating the distant trees with fresh powder, the flurries had not yet reached the smaller mountain in the foreground. Mere moments after taking the shot, the whole landscape was covered in snow.",
