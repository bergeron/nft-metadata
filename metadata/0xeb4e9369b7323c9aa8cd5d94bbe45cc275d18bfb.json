    "description": "Political leaders are like big children who see war as a game, throwing real people's lives around like plastic soldiers. They treat them carelessly, insensitively and ruthlessly. Have you ever seen children chew on toys when they are teething? We can see the same thing now. War is always horror, pain and suffering and there is simply no place for it in the 21st century. When will these children grow up?",
