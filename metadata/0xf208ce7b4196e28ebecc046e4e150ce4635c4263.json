    "description": "**Darkness** gives way to oneself, restoring importance to a **few simple essentials**.   \n\nIn a suspension of space, where time is marked by biological rhythm. It brings us back to contact with ourselves and to internal dialogue.   \n\nA dialogue that cyclically returns, when we least expect it, even when we do not call it.   \n\nIn the essentiality of this visual creation, **everyone finds their own space, their own time, their own evocation**.",
