    "description": "\"She finds herself lost in thought instead of focused on the task at hand. She dreams of what else could be out there, of other beings and the planets they inhabit. She dreams of the day she'll visit the stars beyond and witness the magic of the cosmos.\"\n\nI created this collection as a reflection of myself, struggling with the transition from full-time working mom to a stay-at-home mom.

I often found myself daydreaming of web3 and listening to Twitter spaces instead of sweeping the floors and scrubbing toilets. \n\nThis piece was created digitally on my iPad using the program Procreate and my Apple Pencil.
