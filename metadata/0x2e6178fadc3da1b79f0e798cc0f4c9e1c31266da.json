    "description": "About the work:\nMuch care was taken on the particles physical dynamics that fills the statue during the explosion. The matter created by the explosion is a molten Lithium, which in fact comes from the explosions of a Nova.\n\nThe trajectories of the camera shots follow a circular motion similar to those of celestial orbits in space. The music was composed by dear friend and very talented NFT Artist \"Cibarius.\"\n\nDescription:\nNova is an astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently \"new\" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months.\n\nMeccanica Celeste 2.0:\nAnimations and Particles Physical Dynamics merge to enhance the passion for finding the ever more unique Textures. The journey through the the motions of objects in outer space continues, but adding an extra dimension to increase the sensations to the viewer of the works.\n\n2125 x 2777 pixels  MP4 Ultra High detailed / High-Resolution Video\n",
