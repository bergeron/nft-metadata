    "description": "Artistic-graphic interpretation of a contemporary ideological fusion. NASTIC experiment works on graphic interpolation of few symbols. NFT rarity - in this case - is not defined by specific attribute quantities but it is the result of community personal perception and appreciation of attributes combinations. ATTENTION: Swastika can be present as representation of contemporary specter of the past: a warning to prevent the past from repeating itself in a different present. It is not used as political or ideological propaganda symbol.",
