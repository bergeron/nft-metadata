    "name": "Danfo Conductor",
    "description": "“Danfo” is a popular yellow bus in Lagos. The events that take place in it are mostly crazy and also funny. The conductor calls passengers into the bus and collects the fares. This work is a very risky one, as a person hangs on a bus (even while it's in motion). This young man hanging on the yellow bus is hustling day and night to cater for himself and his family’s needs.\n\nDue to the high rate of poverty and unemployment, 25% of earnings from this piece will be used to send at least a kid back to school and also help a trader/hustler on the street.",
