    "description": "Art is changing. The possibilities of AI are amazing. When I started doing art, everything was different - the artists had workshops filled with canvases and stretchers. My friends and I would get together in the studio and talk about art. Now we gather on spaces on Twitter, and we create paintings at home at the computer. Is there a place for a living artist in a world with evolving AI? Or is the time when the last painting on Earth will appear close?\n\nAI + DIGITAL painting.\n2023",
