    "description": "Whale Sharks, the oceans gentle giant. \n\nThough there is very little we know for sure about the migration patterns and life cycle of this gentle creature it is thought that the species lives well above 100 years old, cruising thousands of kilometres of tropical, warm and temperate oceans annually.  \n\nMy mind often wonders what secrets these gentle giants must keep across the span of their lives. What do they see of the ocean that we cannot even fathom? Is there anything more calming and wildly terrifying than cruising the endless blues of the open ocean for over 100 years? \n",
