    "description": "This series of the painting is inspired by Loy Krathong (Yi Peng) festivities – the tradition associated with Northern Thailand. It is the artist’s abstract perception of the atmosphere created by Thailand’s cold season and traditional celebrations related to this unique festival. It is her attempt to reinterpret the surrounding reality and to invite the viewers to contemplate the impressions of this exhibition.",
