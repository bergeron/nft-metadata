    "description": "Moments In Solitude: \n\nThe power of a photo to invoke emotion is truly visual medicine for the soul. This medicinal effect fills the body of both the viewer of the photo and the taker of the photo. \n\nThe globe has experienced a collective trauma built from some of the hardest moments we have had to face as a people for many generations.\n\n\"Moments in Solitude\" is a visual exploration and dissection of that trauma through the study of light and composition, and their potency as guides to the emotional tone of the images. With emotions out, vulnerable and in plain view, this collection is meant confront and embrace the feelings of sadness, loneliness, the sentiment of loss, and then heal the wounds endured.\n\nThis collection is my feelings delivered with vulnerability and honesty --I'm ready for you to come along with me on this healing journey.
