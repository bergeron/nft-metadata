    "description": "The concept of automatic translation lies at the core of Manuel Fois' research, as he has long been dedicated to exploring the process of creating synthetic images through the utilization of data.\n\nIn this work, An MP3 track,  previously recorded in an outdoor environment,  chosen by the artist is processed using an algorithm that isolates and converts the audio data within the file into a visual output.\n\nThe file's inherent data are reconverted with an algorithm to automatically generate visual sequences of linear patterns. This process enables the conversion of entire audio recordings, typically produced by the artist in outdoor environments, to achieve a result reminiscent of metamorphosis or a synthetic, digital landscape. Devoid of recognizable subjects and distinct points of reference, this landscape presents a perspective moving towards a total abstraction.",
