    "description": "3000*3000 png\n2021\n\nI always feel disconnected to the world. In my journey of doing Illustrations, It’s not all about Pursuing the Fascinating visuals or extraordinary stories，It’s more about using those tools to describe how I feel, so I can reconnected to the world.\n\nBut It’s been hard to explain the relationship between my works and me. So why don’t I becomes parts of my works. Then here I am, let me introduce myself again, I am Yin, I am here to share with you my world.",
