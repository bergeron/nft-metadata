    "description": "The human mind loves to see familiar things in shapes and patterns. That is how many deep-space objects are named. \n\nMessier 83 Galaxy has been named the \"Southern Pinwheel Galaxy\" due to its shape and resemblance to the Northern Pinwheel Galaxy, Messier 101. \n\nIn Web3 this galaxy has been given another name Sloika \"Слойка\", named after a Russian layered puff pastry, because of its layered look.  \n\nSouthern Pinwheel is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 15 million light-years away. It is in the direction border of the Hydra and Centaurus constellations. As one of the closest and brightest barred spiral galaxies it is sometimes visible with a pair of binoculars.\n\nExtended Editorial.
