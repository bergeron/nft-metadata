    "description": "One of a series of images focusing on the Barbican Centre, London's largest collection of brutalist architecture. This image, taken in 2015, won me an award as one of the top 20 creatives to look out for in 2015. \nIn this image, the viewer is shown a different view of the mundane, the forgotten elements of design and architecture. \n\nAn exert from my Barbican book made in 2015 is below:\n\n'The project aims to break the stereotypical approach involved with architecture photography with images captured deliberately with an abstract mindset. Creating photographs that the viewer has to decide if what they are seeing is real or manipulated.\n\nThis image was taken on a Mamiya RB67 with Portra 400 120mm film.",
