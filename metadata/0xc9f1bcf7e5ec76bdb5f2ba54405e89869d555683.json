    "description": "'Mirror Mirror' is a candid street photograph that invites the viewer to explore the poetic possibilities hidden within our urban environment. This photograph was a defining moment in my journey as a creative street photographer - a chance encounter with a harmonious arrangement of random elements, tied together by rhythmic patterns of red & black woven throughout the frame. In the foreground, two mirrors reach skyward as unlikely flowers sprung from concrete. The mirrors resemble shallow pools, reflecting hints of an alternate reality painted on the opposing wall. To the far left, the symbolic shape of a bird echoes with the woman's stride and the rightmost mirror frame. Between the mirrors, a woman takes her confident step, with triangulated glints of gold from head to toe, punctuating the poetry being written around her.  \nFor the mindful eye, the street is a playground. \n\nMirror Mirror (2015)  \nPhoto by Jack Simpson  \nEdition of 30  \nDecember 12, 2015  \nSan Francisco, California",
