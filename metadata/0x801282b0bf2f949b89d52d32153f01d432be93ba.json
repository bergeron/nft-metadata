    "description": "Sango is the Yoruba God of Thunder, Lightning and Fire. The most revered and feared of the gods worshipped by a host of Yorubas and non-Yorubas both home and abroad till date.\n\nThink the Greek's Zeus, think the Roman's Jupiter, think the Yoruba's Sango!\n\nHowever, there is a name Sango is also called by worshippers that steers reverent fear into their hearts till date; and that other name is Obakoso. That's the inspiration behind the creation of this image - THE REINCARNATION OF 'KOSO!\n\n",
