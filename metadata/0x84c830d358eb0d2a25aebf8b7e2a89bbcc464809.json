    "description": "Photo by Emre Ceylan\nYear : 2021\nEdition 1/1\nLocation : Ancient city of Blaundus / Western Anatolia, UÅŸak Province\nBuilt by Macedonians at around 300 BC \n\nAstro Photography is a jewel on my Timescapes Collection. Specially Panoramas. \n\nSince I was a child, I lay on grass at night watching sky, thinking of the vastness of space and mesmerize by its beauty. \n\nOn a clear summer night with a visible milky way, you are looking at your own galaxy and galactic center ( the brightest part of the milky way ) is 27.000 light years away from you.  \n\nThat means the light reaching your eye started it's journey in the stone age. A mind boggling concept of space and time spin my head around and make me question my existence at the same time. \n\nNow you can imagine how I feel when I work on this project. \n\nYou can find the story  behind this photograph on my youtube channel.\n",
