    "description": "Chicago was a dream for me, I was a mod for a Chicago feature page back in 2018; We did a meet up in which I got to meet the team and other creators from all over the place. One of my best travel experiences without doubt. I loved everything about the city, clean, easy transportation, incredible people, and beautiful architecture. \n\nThis photo was captured in one of my last days where I followed the morning light everywhere it took me. \n\n1/1 by 1QBAN",
