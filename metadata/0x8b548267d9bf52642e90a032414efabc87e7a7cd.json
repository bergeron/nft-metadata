    "description": "I love chasing weather and storms, fog is one of my favorites.\n\nThis is the story of a city gripped with fog and unexplained phenomenon.\n\nThe year is 2022, the city is Toronto...  \nThere are rumors and urban legends that creatures lurk within the fog..  \nThe fog has been showing up everyday and is so dense that even with a flashlight you couldn't see 2 feet in front of you. \nI have been documenting and investigating the fog occurrences to see if they are linked to the missing people in the city.\n\nAs I start my day I brew a fresh cup of coffee, grab my gear, my camera, my protection and I head to the roof which is the first stop.",
