    "description": "\"Love and Cyberpunk\" is a cautionary tale of what would happen if the one you love suffers from cyberpsychosis. Could you stomach killing your love before they go on a mindless slaughter fueled by all the cybernetic augmentations they have accrued to such a degree that it begins to erode the mind? Would you let him kill you for fear that you can't do it yourself? Is it some form of love to deliver the mercy kill? Is it better for you to do it rather than the authorities? In a futuristic dystopia, this might be the twisted form of love experienced in this concrete hellscape.\n\nIn this moment, Ale",
