    "description": "This piece is quite personal to me, as a Chinese descent born in Indonesia: the land of diversities. For the last 8 years, I've been living in Bali and am constantly awed by the richness of the Balinese culture. When you talk about Bali, Barong always comes up top in mind. And I can't help but notice that there are similarities between the Balinese barongs and the Chinese barongsai, which I grew up watching during my childhood.\n\nBarongsai is a lion mask dance, usually performed during Chinese New Year to bring luck and chase away demons. Barong Bangkung is a boar-like Barong from Bali, performed by the Balinese children, going around the village (ngelawang) to reject evil spirits and celebrate the winning of Dharma (good) over Adharma (evil). Both are accompanied with loud music: Barongsai with gongs and cymbals, and Barong Bangkung with the Balinese gamelan.\n\nDifferent culture, same purpose. You see, we're not that different at all.\n\n3000 x 3000",
