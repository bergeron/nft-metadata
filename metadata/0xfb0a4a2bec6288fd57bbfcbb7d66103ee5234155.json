    "description": "Bauhinia is Hong Kongâ€™s emblem, which implies harmony of a family, and the love and affection amongst the family members. The flower symbolizes reunion, and Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China, which prospers in the embrace of the Motherland.  A blooming bauhinia is being transferred into a digital art, and tokenised as NFTs on blockchain to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Establishment of HKSAR on a permanent basis.",
