    "description": "My self destructive mind, Vs my creative mind. \n\nAn ongoing struggle - Two Minds facing each other down, fighting for dominance. Elements representing anger, confusion, helplessness and the unknown, contrast with feelings of excitement, possibility and respite.\n\nConceptually, the majority of my photographic art revolves around living my days out as an artist with a genetic chronic illness/ mental illness and how I deal with this. \nThis artwork represents these struggles, and how I use my photographic art as a form of therapy.\n\nNavigating the mine field of depression and anxiety, yet finding a way to pull inspiration and beauty to continue on and create, is not an easy feat. Though, one that is ultimately worth it.\n",
