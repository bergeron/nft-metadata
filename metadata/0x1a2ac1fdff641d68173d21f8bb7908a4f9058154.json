    "description": "A community driven nft project by eur0, celly, mao, york & cloudy. Time flies, and everyone misses Saturday morning cartoons. We are firm believers in the idea that the child in all of us is still present and that we all have the right to express ourselves as we see fit. The world of NFTs is so popular because we all have nostalgic feelings for the things we miss from our childhood. Let us keep our heads in the clouds and continue to dream big.",
