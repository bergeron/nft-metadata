    "description": "Keep this mysterious mass of swirling energy safe. Incubate it by keeping it under the protective magic of an Artifact. Have your Fae, Jinns, Nymphs, and other Enchanted Beings watch over it, tend it, and help it grow. On June 30th you will have the opportunity to hatch your Ovo for big prizes. \n \nArtwork by @yourlittlefaces  \n \nNote: Keep your NFTs unlisted to qualify. Moving the egg to a different wallet deactivates it. Make sure to always have at least one unlisted Artifact + Fae tending your egg. Time + # of NFTs = Bigger prizes.",
