    "description": "Hi, I'm Shower Thought #1.  \nThe first of her kind. \n\nCreated by Haitian-American artist and graphic designer Sarah Duvivier. I'm a cyborg from a different dimension advocating for the destigmatization of mental health. You guessed it, even in my digital world, mental health matters. I try setting time out of my busy schedule to relax and hop in the matrix shower to unwind. Let's celebrate our small wins together.",
