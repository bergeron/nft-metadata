    "description": "A few months ago, the great Elon Musk saved 5,000 super special Doges and gave them new life! Since then, they've been competing to determine which special Doge amongst them will be the next Twitter CEO! Today, Elon announced that he has chosen the winner; he has chosen the new Twitter CEO!\n\nBut here's, the thing; the new Twitter CEO has a huge task ahead of her and is going to need all the help and support she can get! That's why Elon is waiting for all 5,000 of them to find loving homes before letting her begin her new position. Any that's where you get to come in!",
