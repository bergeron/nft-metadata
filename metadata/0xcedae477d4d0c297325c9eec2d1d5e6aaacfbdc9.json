    "description": "Rose, Edith, Opal & Elaine are having a Queens night out. They are headed to a Tupperware Party. Never did they expect the Tupperware Party would become a seance, when Edith finds a rosary in her purse and attempts to cast the devil out of Opalâ€™s deviled eggs. The clock strikes 2am. With Elaine full tilt possessed, Rose, Edith, and Opal attempt to cast the spirit out of Elaine by frantically matching Tupperware lid to Tupperware container. Some would call them on the verge. But we call them Queens Of The Night.",
