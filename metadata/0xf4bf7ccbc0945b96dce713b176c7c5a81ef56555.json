    "description": "It was a late summer day. I awoke in the early morning hours, snuggled inside my sleeping bag, in the back of my SUV. I quickly got dressed, wiped the condensation from the windshield and started the engine. The car revved as I raced to catch the sunrise. It was starting to get light and I had overslept. As I arrived at the parking lot, the nearby mountain peaks had begun to glow a faint shade of red in the light of dawn. I rushed up the short trail to the lookout which gazes onto the lake below. There wasn't another soul in sight. Finally, I got to the viewpoint and was absolutely stunned by the scene in front of me. The sun had all but disappeared behind the clouds. The sky was a shade of dark grey and there was fog quickly rolling over the mountains, lake and forest below. The moody ambience and stillness in the air made me feel an overwhelming sense of peace and wonder. \n\nThis image was photographed and curated by Vincent Schnabl, photographer based out of Canada.\n\nEdition 1/1",
