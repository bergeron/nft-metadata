    "description": "There she sits\nWith all those noises in her head\nYears of pains and tears\nBottling everything within herself\nShe told herself no one will listen\nShe told herself she was at fault\nShe blamed herself for the pains inflicted on her\nHer pillow drenched in tears every night\nHer face filled with smile in the morning\nAll she ever wished for is to be able to scream out her pains\nTo be able to get them all out\nProbably if she scream out of her head\nShe will feel so much better\nAnd be able to have a peaceful sleep and dreams.",
