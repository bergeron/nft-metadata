    "description": "Iran is going through a revolution led by women. The totalitarian regime in Iran is trying to resist people's will by any means, even killing innocent men, women & children in streets and in their homes. \nMany lives has been lost and many families are struggling.\n\nFor the first time ever, the world is behind people of Iran and is strongly condemning the violence against civilians. This work is created as a mean to raise funds to support those families who are struggling financially. \n\n* No part of the funds raised will be used to support violence against the regime in anyway and the sole purpose of this fundraiser is to disperse the funds amongst those who need it the most to feed their families. Due to the sensitive nature of this fundraiser, there will be no possibility of transparency on where exactly the funds has been send to as this will put the recipients in grave danger.",
