    "description": "Wabi-sabi is a Japanese word that roughly translates to \"beauty in imperfection\", an aesthetic present in all shapes across Japan, and not just in arts. Beauty awaits at every corner when strolling the streets of Tokyo â€“ if one knows where to look!\n\nIn this collection, I wish to share some of the beauty I found in unexpected places.\n\nResolution 4000*6000px",
