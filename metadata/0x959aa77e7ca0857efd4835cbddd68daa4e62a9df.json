    "description": "Sometimes the things we believe are inconveniences, actually turn out to be blessings in disguise.\n\nDue to weather and transportation delays, my day of photography in New York was thrown off schedule. Normally, I would have been frustrated if plans changed last minute, but in this case, I couldnâ€™t have gotten any luckier.\n\nAs I was pacing across the Brooklyn Bridge to reach my desired shooting location, I looked over to find the Statue of Liberty off in the distance, trapped under a sea of dark clouds. As I pulled out my camera, the sun rays pierced through the clouds and created this golden hour scene that left me in awe. After a few short minutes, the rays disappeared. I knew that whatever I would end up shooting afterwards on that same day, would not compare to what I just witnessed.\n\nWas it luck, or fate?",
