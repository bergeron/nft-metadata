    "description": "Acrylic painting\n1420*1000 mm\nALENA KAHOTSKAYA\n\nThis video is made of one acrylic painting moving from night till day by physical changing original coloring.\n\nSometime I think paintings have own plan, they just come. This painting I made when came back from Malta and instead of sunny Malta I've got Petersburg on my canvas.\n\nFirst I made it as dark version, but later I’ve got the vision that I want to see this city in light colors. Petersburg is often rough and gloomy. But when I'm that one who creates the mood in my city, I can use bright colors and make my Petersburg always sunny.\n\nAt the end I’ve made this 9,9 sec video, which is like one day and if you watch it for one hour on repeat it will be like one year of real life. What are you thinking about when you see this time running so fast, what is really important at the end? \n\nPetersburg is a great place to think about fundamental things. So you can rest your mind and watch life flow. \n\nFirst buyer can get original canvas as a gift.",
