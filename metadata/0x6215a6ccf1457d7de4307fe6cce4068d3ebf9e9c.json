    "description": "Some challenges shouldn't be faced alone. Some challenges are Titan-sized for a reason. For some...it's the ever tempestuous Typhon, walking through the expansive Ro plains, causing havoc and chaos across villages and towns wherever he roams. One could try to deal with it yourself, sure. In fact, one could prefer it. But sometimes, when getting the attention of a Titan, it is good to have friends who have ones back.\n\n4000 x 2780 | JPG | Procreate | Freehand | iPad",
