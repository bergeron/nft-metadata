    "description": "This is Vybe Village first collab with an artist as a label. Chris Punsalan is an emerging producer making his mark on the hip hop music scene. ‘Portland’ is a groovy beat built around soulful guitar licks and airy synth melodies. It is a pure shot of chill vibes thanks to its melodic baseline and swinging drums. He’s grown a steady following in the millions worldwide for his viral videos taking care of his grandmother. He's a kind soul with a fan base that is eager to hear what he drops next.\n\nArtwork by Cody A Banks & L.Dre",
