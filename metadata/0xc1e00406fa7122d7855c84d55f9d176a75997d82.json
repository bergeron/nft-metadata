    "name": "Chapter 1: The Birth of Bobo",
    "description": "A space ship drifts slowly within a cold starry space. A purple glow of energy illuminates the inner ship, falling upon a new born child. A child named Bobo.\n\nThe new parents gaze at him. Happy and delighted as their new born son begins to smile. Suddenly, it's as if the void around them begins to shine even brighter. \n\nThe mother telekinetically wraps her son in a green fabric cloth. Laying him upon the bed of the ship. And as the stars begin to shine, a new star is born. \n\nAnd so the legend begins. \n\nBobo The Epic.    ",
