Even though my mom is a floral designer and I was around them all the time, I knew I couldn't ever risk showing any interest in them.\n\n\nNow, as a proud gay man, my work celebrates my freedom to explore and enjoy these flowers openly. Placing them in water - outside of their expected environment - forces them to be seen with new eyes... Like I did when I first started allowing myself to enjoy them.  \n\n\nBecause the full resolution file is so large, I've elected to upload slightly smaller image that is optimized for cross platform viewing and cyber gallery display. If the collector would like to have the image replaced with the full res image I'm happy to update the token at any time.\n\n\nFull Res File:  \nhttps://arweave.net/ZF_FqHOxfMjmNgbZ17hCjEIc1wCV3PfeWvb-DGGOUrc\n\n\nSeries Trailer: https://www.calebleeadams.com/suspended",
