    "description": "A population of lights continues to breathe\nAnd evolve as a young soul watches on.\nA constant reminder of the luxury upon\nThose who avoid the darkness beneath.\n\nThey do not fade, dim or disappear\nEven though the inhabitants may be exchanged\nTo the bottom, it could never be explained\nEven though the lights seemed so near\n\nMore lights appear above,\nBeyond into the night sky,\nBut never to the darkness would they would lie\nThey form ladders, of various sorts, never enough\n\nForever did it seem,\nThe length of time it would take;\nFor the youth to find and make\nA dream that one could redeem.\n\n--\n\nArtist Name: Derek Domnic D'souza\n \nInstagram: @derekdomnicdsouza\nYoutube: @derekdomnicdsouza\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/derekdomnicdsouza\n \n\nArtist Bio: Derek Domnic D'souza is a creative director and illustrator based out of Bangalore, India.
