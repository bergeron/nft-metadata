    "description": "When I first started drawing this box, I wanted it to reflect the saying \"the main thing is inside, not outside.\" That's why I drew it as usual, even though it is decorated. And inside it there is something incredible that takes your breath away and delights.\n\nThere are a few hints here that hint at what will be inside this box:  \nPlease take a close look at the stickers, they will help you understand who the work that is inside is related to... \nThe box is large enough in size, so there will be many items in one picture and they are all related to gifts for Valentine's Day.\n\nBy buying this artwork, you give a wonderful mood to three people at once: yourself, your loved one and me.\n\nHappy Valentine's Day, love",
