    "description": "Palmy Days\n\n“Palmy Days-19” is what I like to call it.\n\nLiving in Waikiki during the pandemic was a mixture of emotions. I am so glad I had my photography to dive into at the time to keep me occupied & sane. It did come with a lot of boundaries. The lockdowns & curfews did make it really hard to shoot. We had no incoming tourists, so Hawai’i was a ghost town. It’s hard to image one of the most popular destinations in the world, dead quiet. The beaches somewhat recovered, the sunscreen cleared from the water, & fish and seals came back, it was pure bliss.. Until you’re told you are not allowed on the beach, and to get to the water you can only “traverse” the sand. Police were watching everywhere. So in order to drone all of 2020, I had to be standing in the water, which made launching and landing a bit hard. This image would usually have 100’s of people in it, and forget about the clarity.  \nI miss this Hawai’i, the stillness. \nI don’t think we will ever see Waikiki like this again..",
