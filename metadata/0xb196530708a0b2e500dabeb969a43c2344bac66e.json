    "description": "Walking up to these ruins was something I'll never forget. The energy was very real there and you could feel it, even making me emotional at one point. Despite having seen tons of videos of people walking into these sacred spaces, I just couldn't bring myself to do the same. This may have been someone's home thousands of years ago for all I knew. Witnessing this firsthand was such a surreal experience and something I never imagined I'd be capable of doing.",
