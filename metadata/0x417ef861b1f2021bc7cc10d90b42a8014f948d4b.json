    "name": "Leap of Faith",
    "description": "What would you do if you werenâ€™t afraid?\n//\nThis photo was captured in Maui, Hawaii during sunset. Sitting there watching people leap off of this cliff that was 20+ feet in the air reminded me that sometimes in life you have to take a leap of faith. You may not know how things will end up, but you truly don't know what you're capable of until you push yourself past where your fear previously stopped you.\nThis is appropriately my first minted NFT as this serves as my Leap of Faith into this community, and a step in my artist journey as a whole. In owning this, I hope it serves as a reminder to step out of your comfort zone and see just what you're capable of.",
