    "description": "the MOON is my metaphor of youth, high hopes & aspirations.\n\nIt has always charmed me. Here are my thoughts about what is happening on the far side of the Moon. That's what I felt when I was a teen.\nHope you will look at it and it will take you back to your age of innocence, too.\n\nI wish I managed to allegorise my feelings, thoughts and dreams. A little bit of modern art, a pinch of theatrical scenery and a handful of feminine beauty are combined to create this artwork.\n\nIt's not about nudity, it's about purity of mind.\n\nThis is my very first NFT on Foundation.
