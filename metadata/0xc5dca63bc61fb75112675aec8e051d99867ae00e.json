    "description": "Never quite ready to start the day,  \nOne moment please! Any excuse to delay,  \nThe world that awaits me, an endless fray,  \nWith peace and calm, so far away.\n\nCountless days blend into one,  \nMore goals completed, yet nothing's done,  \nA soul that aches me, what have I won?  \nWith time against me, I can't outrun. \n\nThinking too much leaves me distraught,  \nFlames alight and wait to be caught,  \nStop! Drop, and please roll into good thoughts,  \nFor one brief moment, with time that I've bought.\n\nA lovely warm glow drifts into view,  \nLook! Another! A beautiful hue,  \nTime be kind, slow this moment for me,  \nThe leaves are falling, so playful and free.\n\nHow did I miss this all before?  \nA sky so captivating, hard now to ignore,  \nA world of wonders, so easy to find,  \nWith one look up,  I ease my mind.",
