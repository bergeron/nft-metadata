    "name": "Lunar, the Water Tiger",
    "description": "A long, long time ago, the lion rather than the tiger was a Chinese zodiac sign. However, the lion was too ferocious and notorious, so the Jade Emperor in charge of Chinese Zodiac wanted to remove the lion from the list and he had to choose another animal to replace the lion. At this time, the Jade Emperor thought of the tiger guardian in front of the Heavenly Palace.\n\nPreviously, the tiger guardian was an unknown animal on the earth. It learnt various martial arts, such as catching, flapping, biting, rushing and jumping, from the Master Cat and became a warrior in the forest. All the animals contesting with it were killed or injured. Since then, the tiger became the king in the forest. Later, the Jade Emperor heard that the tiger was very brave, so he ordered the tiger to go to the heaven. After coming to the heaven, the tiger defeated the guardians of the Jade Emperor and became the new guardian.",
