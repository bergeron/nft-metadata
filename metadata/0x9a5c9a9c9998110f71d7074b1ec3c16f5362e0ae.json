And there were enough doughnuts in that box that each of us could have our own if we pleased but instead we would painstakingly carve away at one doughnut at a time. Why? Because no one wanted anyone else to go without, it was just the nice thing to do. This design shows off some delicious, 3D glazed doughnuts. All the letters are glazed except for the very special letter \"C\" which has baby pink icing and all the sprinkles.\"",
