    "description": "Blockposal is our idea of a platform that allows anyone to own any idea they have. By detailing an idea using our web interface it is possible for anyone with internet access to tokenise that idea and own it on the blockchain. Supporting files can also be attached to ensure all relevant information is contained and linked to an idea.\nTaking this a step further, Blockposal can expose an API for custom integrations with traditional web2 platforms and systems to tokenise not just ideas but any data imaginable.\nEventually, we believe Blockposal will become a self-service web2 -> web3 platform for anyone or any organisation to use to properly own their most important data.",
