    "description": "In the year 2050, CyberZila had become a place of extreme poverty and scarcity, and the only way to survive was to be resourceful. Among the poor, an old man named Raman had a dream to create a sci-fi suit that would help him fight back against the injustices of the world. Using scraps, polythenes, wraps, wires, cables, circuits, packets, and mouse parts, Raman built the suit in DIY style. Because people could not afford to make it in factories, the suit looked a bit unfinished, but it was incredibly functional. Equipped with all sorts of gadgets and tools that Raman had salvaged, the suit had incredible strength, speed, and agility. Raman donned the suit and set out into the world, becoming a symbol of hope and resilience for the poor and downtrodden. IronMech was a testament to the power of human ingenuity and determination, and it inspired others to use their creativity to create something remarkable, even in the face of extreme adversity.",
