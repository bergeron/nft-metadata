    "description": "Artist: Amir Shirazian\n\nThis photo was taken in the North of Iran a place called Filband. The combination of high mountains and dense forests which pass through a large number of white clouds has turned the village special. \nFinding and waiting for sunset and the time which sun going to cover by cloud gave me this sunbeam.\nThis photo is created by stitching  3 photos to get this wide-angle view with high resolution. \n\nsize:\n8220*3158\n\nEdition:\n1/1\n",
