    "description": "A photo worth missing a flight over? On the tail end of a trip to NYC in 2018 I decided to photograph one last sunset before heading to the airport. \n\nI took the A train to Brooklyn, suitcase and all, with hopes to get some good light over one of my favorite New York scenes. \n\nThe sky was completely empty (which was good because I didn't have time to stay through sunset). As I was packing up my gear I started to see clouds start to come over the Manhattan Skyline (oh shit, I thought).\n\nI figured I'd stick around a few longer and get an Uber instead of the train to catch my flight on time. Well the clouds started to fill the sky as the sun was setting, and created the most beautiful pink patterns in the frame using long exposures. \n\nI came to peace knowing I'd probably miss my flight and decided it would be well worth it. As the light faded I called the Uber with the hopes I'd still make it. \n\nHeart racing, I ran through the airport and got to the gate just before they closed the door.\n",
