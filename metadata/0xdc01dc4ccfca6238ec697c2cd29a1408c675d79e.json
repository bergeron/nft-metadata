    "description": "My entire life revolves around making music. Every day I wake up, brush my teeth, go on a run, and basically make songs until the sun goes down. If I had to estimate, I probably make close to 30 songs/mini ideas per month - and thatâ€™s being very conservative.\n\nOut of the 300+ song ideas that I make per year, I realistically only get 12-15 at bats to show DSPs what Iâ€™m working on. Often times, that curation has to do with what artists are on what song, who else is releasing in the same week, and a bunch of other politics that donâ€™t make a ton of sense. \n\nReleasing music shouldnâ€™t be complicated.\n\nKevin George sent me this acapella last week as my flight from Miami back home to LA was taking off. I produced the entire thing from start to finish on the flight. I tweaked it that night, bounced it and played it at the Glass House release party the next day.\n\nIâ€™m putting this song out to challenge the notion that every song has to have the perfect roll out and campaign. If you love a record, put it out. It doesnâ€™t matter if it took you 3 hours or 3 years ðŸ’›",
