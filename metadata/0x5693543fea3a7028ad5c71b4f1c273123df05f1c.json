    "description": "This infinitely performed text examines the relationship between interiority and exteriority in an era where our practice of consuming and producing online relentlessly influences our sense of self. It features excerpts from articles, books, essays, personal journals over a span of 10+ years, as well as text fragments (I call them \"internet trash\" lol) observed and collected throughout my time spent scrolling. The work layers these snippets to mimic our habit of overwriting our identities on screen again and again and again.\n\nCustom software (color, silent), computer, screen or projector  \nDimensions variable  \nGenerative  \nJavaScript, HTML, CSS  \nEdition of 1 + 1 AP (not minted)\n\nView the work in your browser: https://readitandweep.live/",
