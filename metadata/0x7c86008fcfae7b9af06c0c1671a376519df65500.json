    "description": "As I drove up a high hill overlooking the rice fields in an afternoon, I noticed the stunning beauty of this scene.I stopped and took this photo with a 70-200 telephoto lens without attracting attention.These women in beautiful local Lori clothes, happy and smiling, were passing through the rice field towards their village.I love the forms of the rice field.",
