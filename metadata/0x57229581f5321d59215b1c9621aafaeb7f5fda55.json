    "description": "This item is part of the series CATTLE. This boutique collection centers around the theme of female re-empowerment. It expresses the emotional road of liberation through body movements, like a choreography. The female character is sexy, free and colorful. But she is also vulnarable and raw. And what she expresses is urgent: she shows what living in a world that suppresses her does to her emotionally.\nAll items are unique and hand drawn. Each item represents a physical artwork.",
