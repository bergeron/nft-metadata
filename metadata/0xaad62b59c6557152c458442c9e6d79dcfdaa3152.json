    "description": "The theme this time was \"memorial services\". At first, I had no intention to do so, but then I realized that this is what I wanted to do.\n\nIn my old job, I had to deal with the death of people.\nI have heard from many bereaved families.\nMost of them were sad and regretful, but sometimes I heard their voices of joy.\nEach person has many thoughts and stories to tell.\n\nThese experiences have greatly influenced my view of life and death, my personality, and my artwork.",
