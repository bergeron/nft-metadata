    "description": "'Gyeol' [Grain] is also a unique concept and method reinterpreted by Han Hongsu throughout years of contemplation and experimentation. Han Hongsu overlaps several transparent layers on a canvas, creating layers whose texture is barely felt. This act is akin to 'forming a natural grain,' rather than ‘stacking.’ Han Hongsu makes these textures flow with oil on canvas.\n\n#NFTart  #physical-based  #grain  #red\n",
