    "description": "MALI is the first piece of a serie where coding meets organic; a generative layer of unpredictable geometries is melted with japanise ideograms [composed by a calligraphist and filmed]. Binnary and imperfections, linearities ad curves, create a new dimension of contrasts and complementarities. It's a fusion of glassy surface [sometimes smooth, sometimes nervous] and a world of references which harmonically moves below [or together?].\nMALI mirrors the idea of perceiving, without really seeing, the story below the estetic. It's the core of the artistic research of Loon",
