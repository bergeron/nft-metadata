    "description": "Checks by Jack Butcher is a visual design style that features minimalistic, monochromatic designs with bold black and white checks. The checks are often used to create a contrast and add interest to the overall design.\n\nThe checks design has been incorporated with the \"Chad Thundercock\" meme, which is a slang term used to describe a man who is confident, attractive and successful with women. The Chad meme often features images of men with exaggerated facial expressions, and the checks design style has been incorporated into these images to create a visually striking and attention-grabbing meme. The combination of the bold checks with the confident, macho imagery of the Chad meme creates a unique and humorous representation of the archetype. Maybe will burn for a gigachad. Maybe not.",
