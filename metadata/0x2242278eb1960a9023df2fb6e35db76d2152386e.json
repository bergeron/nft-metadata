    "description": "The brightness of the sky is reflected in the eyes of the performer here. The exotic classical pose represents Radhaâ€™s joy of being with Lord Krishna. The style of Bharatanatyam hails from the southern region of India. The relationship of a devotee with the lord and social lessons are hinted at; these too have Krishna as the central theme.\n\nThis perfect picture could enlighten any corner of your house, office, or work studio. A simple still subtleness is the highlight of this picture. This would make you dance from inside, no matter where you are or who you are. The performer, Anjani justifies the dance form and the efforts of the camera so gracefully.",
