    "description": "Two years ago I started to draw digitally, until then I drew in a traditional way (Watercolor, Oil, Charcoal,...), but I decided to reinvent myself to adapt to the new times. These were my first 100 embarrassing pieces, this was My Evolution.\n\nHere you can see MY EVOLUTION as an artist over time. Every day that I wake up in this crazy NEW WORLD I feel the need to draw something, to express myself by doing any garbage, to spit out any shit without too much connection or logic, without any predetermined artistic discipline, ... just draw what I want how I want.\n\nROBENS | byrobens.eth\n\nWebSite https://robens.io\n\nTwitter https://twitter.com/byROBENS",
