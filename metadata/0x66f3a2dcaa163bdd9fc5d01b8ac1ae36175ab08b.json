    "description": "Through AI I have discovered a collaborative partner that allows me to create and see dimensions & realities from my minds eye. What a gift to escape our earth bound rules & restrictions. \n\nAs an abstract painter & landscape photographer I am in awe how my emotions come to life as if the painting and mother nature are in sync with me.  It often feels like my mind has been read.\n\nMy first collaborations with AI have astounded me & made me so happy. Since a young age I have been fascinated by physics & and discoveries about dimensions & the theory of the multiverse. Through AI we can bring other worlds and dimensions to life & re discover our childlike innocence, wonder & acceptance of magic & all the realms that surround us.\n\nI hope this AI x Judy collab brings you good vibes & positive energies.\n\nAI, digital 15333 x 15333 RGB\n\nGicl√©e fine art print up to 40 x 60\" available to collector upon request",
