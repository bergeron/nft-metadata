    "description": "[ Decoding Y2K ]\n\nAt the junction between the ΈΞΩVERSE (EXOVERSE) and ΜΈΣΑVERSE (METAVERSE) Hugh Turvey explores material possession, identity and brand in this Xogram series of Y2K inspired accessories. He uses a portion of the EM Spectrum between light / x-ray to decode the visual borders between material and matter + past and future. \nTechnique: Hands-on x-ray imagery digitized from large sheets of x-ray sensitive B/W film. Manipulation: multiple exposure, chemical processing, filtering, rigs, mechanics, computational, physics, happy accidents, trial and error … the pursuit of the science aesthetic... I call these XOGRAMS. (Greek έξω γραμ)\n\n2160X2700px h264 bt.709\n",
