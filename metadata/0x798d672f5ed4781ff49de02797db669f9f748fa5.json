    "description": "The Horsehead nebula is a small dark nebula in the constellation of Orion.  Also known as Barnard 33, the nebula is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is the easternmost star of Orionâ€™s belt. \n\nThe Horsehead nebula is approximately 1,375 light years from Earth.\n\nThe Nebula was first recorded in 1888 by Scottish astronomer Willamina Fleming on a photographic plate taken at the Harvard College Observatory.\n\nThis is a Hydrogen-alpha (Ha) RGB (Red, Green and Blue) image of the Horsehead Nebula.  I captured a little over 6.5 hours of RGB data and combined it with 8.5 hours of narrowband data using a narrowband filter.  This allowed me to keep the natural star colour while also enhancing the Ha regions of the image. \n\nLicence: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
