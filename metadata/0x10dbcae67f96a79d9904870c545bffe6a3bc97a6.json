    "description": "This work describes a person who is difficult to move on from the past. The hand holding someone is interpreted as the past that always haunts the person (object). The choice of a door symbol with a different shape is interpreted as two paths that we have to go through and those that we have passed. One old door on the right represents the past, while a new (modern) door on the left represents the future.",
