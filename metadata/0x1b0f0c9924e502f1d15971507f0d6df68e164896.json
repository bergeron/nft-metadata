    "description": "To free dive, the diver takes one large inhale and dives beneath the surface of the water. Diving with Whale Sharks is a surreal experience and a privilege we are grateful for. Whale Sharks are the biggest shark in the ocean. Being in their presence and in their environment is nothing short of humbling.\nThe woman pictured demonstrates their grandeurs size.\n\n10% from the first sale of this piece will go to a local Shark and Ray research organization called \"Fin Focus\" run by a local shark expert water woman named Re.\n\nPurchase will also include a silver ocean inspired necklace to the first buyer of this piece which was designed by the artist.",
