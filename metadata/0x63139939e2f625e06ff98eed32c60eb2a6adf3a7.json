    "description": "In a computer-dominated age where *digital* equals *perfection* and products of the technological progress have become the answer to solving almost every problem, we rarely pay attention to the consequences that technology can bring. We already know a lot about what we can gain from it — but do we realise what it can take away from our lives? \n\n*The Last Scream* is a NoLoop group's reflection on our relationship with technology. NoLoop refers to controversial study, the Rorschach test, in which subjective perceptions of ink blots were used as a base for psychological analyses of human patients. In *The Last Scream* the group presents these blots to artificial neural networks and then extracts the resulting images from their circuits, turning the products of their perception into artistic artifacts. Underlining complex capabilities of artificial neural networks and twisted ways of their perception can either impress or terrify the viewer — *The Last Scream* reveals both perspectives.",
