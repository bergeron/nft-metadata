    "description": "\"Where your voice can be heard, let them listen.\"\n\nWe casually think of Medusa as a monster; a head full of snakes and a gaze to turn anyone into stone.\n\nAnd even though she's popularly referenced as a monster and rightfully feared, her tragic story reveals that  Medusa is more complex than we imagine.\n\nShe was renowned for her beauty,  and her power persisted even after death, but what can we learn from the ancient story of Medusa and her encounters with Perseus, Poseidon and Athena?\n\nAs an artist, one question I ask myself is, what must she have felt in those moments?\n\nIn \"Beautiful Power\" I imagine her misfortune but also her amusement; her sorrow but also her strength.\n\n---\n\n🤞🏼Jakk Vega supports smart collectors through:\n📊 coordinated marketing activities\n⚡ strategic planning and effort\n🥇 verification of authenticity\n\n🎁Explore additional support and benefits you may receive as a collector of Jakk Vega's artwork on his support website [JV3.xyz](https://jv3.xyz/)\n\n",
