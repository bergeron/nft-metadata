    "description": "It was 10:30 pm on a Tuesday when my iPhone chimes, it was my friend Sami, \"Hey Lalo, I just wrapped, and I have a rabbits head we didn't use for the shoot, I want you to photograph me wearing it. Are you in? I rarely say no to Sami, she's one of my favorite people to create with. And I hadn't seen her in a while. All wins. \n\n When shooting film, I'll first take a few test shots with my digital camera in order to gauge the light, wardrobe, set design, placement of talent, etc. This image was one of the test shots which I quite like and I'm certain you will as well. Plus, I'm giving it away for free. \n\nYou may put the edition up for sale. Or hold on to it and wait to see what transpires. ",
