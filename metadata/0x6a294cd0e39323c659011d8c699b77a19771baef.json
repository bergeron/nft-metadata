    "description": "In January 2010, a 16-year-old Justin Bieber was on his first ever UK tour. I was asked to photograph Bieber for Getty Images during his press presentation at Wesfiled .\nhttps://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/teenage-pop-sensation-justin-bieber-meets-fans-and-signs-news-photo/95853791?adppopup=true\n\nThe shoot lasted less than 10 minutes but I managed to capture some great images of him. He wasn't wearing any make-up and he was very relaxed. After the shoot, he met his fans and signed his album.\n\nI still remember how amazed I was by his big eyes and long eyelashes; his face looked like a little doll!\n\n3400 x 2200 px | 300 Dpi\n5 trees planted with this sale\n\n",
