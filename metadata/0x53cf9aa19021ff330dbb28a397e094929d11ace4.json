    "description": "A wild fantasy of ordinary Kerala women, \nwho live on the lines of ideal women concept written by men ('kulastree sankalpam')\n.\nI'm a Mumbai based Kerala born artist who sketch to meditate in local train ladies compartment. Spirit of Mumbai has a sharp contrast with Kerala .Absence of moral policing and abundant freedom as women folks enjoy here. That's the context of this work.",
