This 3-of-7 performance is with the gorgeous indie pop sag, TAROT @tarotsings.\n\nThese are the first live music performances minted on the blockchain.\n\nwavWRLD partnered with Reveel & Glass.xyz to record & mint the performances.\n\nVideo, Editing & Color by LadiDadi @ladidadilive\nAudio, Mix & Master by Invictus @theoginvictus\n\nAbout the Artist:\n\nJordyn Benedict, aka TAROT, is a Nashville-based indie pop, alternative r&b artist, and songwriter utilizing the tools of web3 to expand her music career and pave her own path. The 24-year-old sold her first NFTs by minting 28 tokens every day in February â€” all of which contained a new song written, produced, mixed, and mastered by Jordyn herself.\n\n\"I believe in alignment and I believe I was led to this career path because connecting and creating with others for a greater purpose than myself is what brings me fulfillment.\" -TAROT",
