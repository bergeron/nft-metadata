    "description": "1/1\n\nThis is the first item on my Foundation app journey and i wish that it brings to me a good fortune. \n\nThe collection items captured maiden parts of the world oceans, thanks to my job. \n\nThis piece from Mid Pacific Ocean, it was a quite stormy day, I captured couple of wave photos and transformed with digital art into this. there are 2 more variation of this item, which i planned to mint next. \n\nI hope you'll like my artworks and support me on this cause I have a huge collection to show and feed you :) \n\nThanks and best regards.
