    "description": "Kasoku is an NFT project that combines the nostalgia of retro 90s Japanese anime with the high-speed world of JDM sportscar racing. Our project aims to create a low supply of NFTs (999) to be minted on the ETH chain using an optimised ERC-721A contract. Each KASOKU avatar will be a unique 1/1 featuring artwork in the style of classic anime series such as Initial D with a modern twist. Contrary to following a generic roadmap, KASOKUâ€™s design is expansive but not limited to all aspects of the Web3 World as a community initiative led project. The world of KASOKU has been beautifully crafted with 999 Speed Demons of Akina including aesthetically pleasing character avatars, limited android counterparts, factions such as the Shadow Racing Syndicate and exclusive visually stunning collaborative pieces.",
