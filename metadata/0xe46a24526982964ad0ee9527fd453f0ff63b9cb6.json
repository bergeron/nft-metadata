    "description": "And you are like a painting that came alive,\nBut, tell me - what artist has painted you?\nMy soul is spinning with yours in a dance, while you seem\nTo color my life in the vivid bright scheme.\n \nShe’s cold as ice, my Muse\nFor me, she mostly sings the blues\nShe beckons and calls skillfully\nHer palms are of art’s the epitome.\n\nPlease, tell me, what you think about?\nAbout love or charming flowers?\nWhen moonlit night become the day\nI promise, all will as you say\n\nAnd looking at her discreet smile, \nAs she listens to me play the piano. \nI feel her pleasure, her whisper, her breath.\nAnd I’m ready to play for her again and again.( until death )\n\nShe's ready!",
