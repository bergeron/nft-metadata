    "description": "Fall\n\na mid afternoon sun illuminates the golden colored trees on a hike in late autumn.\n\nFall can start pretty abruptly after the summer months and strong sunlight start to fade away in early September. \n\nIt also gets quiet pretty quickly after the holidays are over and hikers are less frequent. You will notice the decline in people by the incline in wildlife again. Hare’s and Foxes are spotted pretty often. Also the deer rut is heard every night and nature is preparing for the tough winter months\n\n1/1\n\n4101 × 5741\n\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use for private display and in groups including virtual galleries.
