    "description": "The painting \"Enlightenment\" (No.9) by artist Nguyen Duc Lam has left us with the first impressions, which is about its dark, moody colors. In the picture, we see prominently the image of dirty moss representing evil things, delusional things, people who are said to be greedy, hateful, and delusional. But the beauty of that picture is the blurry, mysterious image of the Buddha's figure and the thin white moon human face like smoke. That face looked like it was trying to get out of the dark mud of life. And it is thanks to the compassionate and generous Buddha who stands behind to support and guide people.\nâ€œA person's life is immersed in a stupor,\nGreed, hatred, delusion, lust for the surface of u-mind,\nDispute and rivalry,\nThe rich accumulate silver, the poor despise the poor,\nDrifting in the direction of the clouds,\nSurrounded by turbidity, suffering from reincarnation,\nOne hundred years of fleeting life,\nQuickly wake up in time to cultivate yourself.\"",
