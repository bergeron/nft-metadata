    "description": "The **gene(rative) collection** is a generative art project where each human gene is depicted as a barcode, a symbol that represents a unique idea. \n\nEach element of the barcode encodes specific information. The first number is the chromosome where the gene is located. The gene name follows, and is filled with 0x and then a string of random numbers. The bars of the bar code are established positions of chromosome banding patterns. The gray bar is the location of the centromere between p- and q-arms and the red bar is the location of the gene. \n\nThis collection starts with two of the 50 most researched and published genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) and will grow in sequence as the pieces are collected; however, custom requests are available for your favorite gene via DMs on twitter.\n",
