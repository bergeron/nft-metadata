    "description": "Of all the variables I contend with in my installation work—rain, fog, rising tides—wind is the hardest to manage. It has foiled more of my shoots than I care to remember, either by tangling the lines that support the installations or toppling the off-camera structures that support them. In 2020, however, I decided to seek out blustery weather instead of avoiding it, constructing pieces designed not only to withstand the wind, but to act as visualizations of its frenetic energy. Overall it was a frustrating collaboration—of the twenty wind-driven installations I made in 2020, thirteen didn’t work out. But exceptions like this piece, shot in 30 MPH winds above Stinson Beach in northern California, made the effort worthwhile. 3000X2359",
