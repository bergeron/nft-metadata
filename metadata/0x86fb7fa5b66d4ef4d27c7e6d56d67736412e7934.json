    "description": "This is my artwork “Give me some…”  \nI have some my small story how I was inspired for creating this art.  \nEverything begun from seeing the art called “Fortune and beggar” by Alexey Markov and reading the fable “Fortune and beggar” by Krylov.\n\nThe story says about the beggar who asked money on the streets and wondered with greed of rich men. All his lords lost their wealth because of their greed (recommend to read this fable).  \nOnce he met Fortune. She said that she make him happier with giving coins. Every coin will disappear if touch the ground.  \nFortune started to fill the beggar’s bag. The bag was too full and Fortune asked to stop because the bag will be tore soon. The beggar didn’t stop. He asked more. \nFinally the bag didn’t stand and tore. All coins fell on the ground and disappeared.  \nThe beggar left with nothing again.\n\nI decided to create my adult version. Here are two sexy girls. The one of them is giving Bitcoins to the other girl. Her bag wasn’t torn. What I thought about while creating my nft? I thought whatever you earn should be used wisely.",
