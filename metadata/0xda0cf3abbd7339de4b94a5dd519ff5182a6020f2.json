    "description": "Mesmerizing eyes melted my heart when I first saw this Alien. This cute fluffy puppy is Hyllus diardi, which belongs to a family of jumping spiders that donâ€™t build webs to trap their prey but are ambush hunters with phenomenal hunting skills. \n\nHyllus diardi are one of the most famous jumpers in the world and are found only in the mangrove forests of Singapore, India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos and Myanmar. Macro photogs travel to Singapore to shoot this jumper as it is a rarity among jumping spider lovers. I feel lucky to have this beautiful jumper. Jumpers have 8 eyes and it will be enlightening to learn how it uses all its eyes to track its prey.\n\nSuperpower: Hyllus diardi can leap up to 20 times their body length. Humans in comparison can jump only upto 5 times their body length.\n\nArtist - Raj Bharathi\n\nEdition - 1/1\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
