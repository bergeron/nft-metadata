    "description": "Although the stone was actually barely noticeable in the sand, it dominates the photo and pushes the beach, the sea and the sky into the background.  \nThe angle of view determines what is placed dominantly in the foreground. So here a small stone becomes something that covers everything else.  \nThe picture is meant to remind us that everything has to be seen from different angles in order to get a picture of reality. Neutral and not focused on one part of the whole.\n\nBuy the picture for more than 350 â‚¬ and you will get an Alu-Dibond sent to you.",
