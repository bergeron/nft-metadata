    "description": "Our genesis on Foundation is a unique 1/1 NFT.\n\nThe scene was shot miles offshore from the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, in a Bell 407 helicopter from 400ft.\n\nThe sea's colour and clarity come about due to filming so far off shore. \n\nThe pristine waters reflect the depth of the ocean where we filmed. \n\nThe broiling white water almost echoes the next landmass, which is  Antarctica.\n\nToby's music and soundscape need to be played full volume - drift away with his score, be elevated, transcend, deep-dive into the vision which mirrors the soundtrack.\n\nThe premis in this piece is, 'are all elements eternal'?\n\nWe sincerely hope they are, but we know they will not be if we continue to burn, destroy and devastate our home planet. \n\nAfter all, there's no Planet B.\n\n10% of revenue from the sale of ELEMENTAL will be donated to Earth Day 2022 | Invest in Our Planetâ„¢\n\nOur Collector will receive full res film file 195.2 MB and up to 3 full  res still frames from the film NFT, sent by email.\n",
