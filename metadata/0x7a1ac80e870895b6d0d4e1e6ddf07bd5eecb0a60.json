    "description": "This virtual sculpture is part of the High Meshes project in which a series of volunteers donated their anatomy to form part of a database of digitised bodies. \nUsing artificial intelligence, the bodies in the database are connected according to their digital information and not their skin colour, sexual tendency, social status, economy or religion.\nWith High Meshes, a new standardised map of human relations is proposed thanks to the precepts of an ethically neutral artificial intelligence, devoid of the weight of history.",
