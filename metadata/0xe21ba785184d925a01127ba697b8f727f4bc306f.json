    "description": "The Southern Alps of New Zealand has some of the most incredible high alpine accommodation in the form of backcountry huts, which are built to withstand the full force of what nature can throw at it. Often situated in some of the most inhospitable locations seen in New Zealand, they are made for survival as much as comfort.\n\nPlateau Hut has one of the most spectacular views of them all. It is used by mountaineers, ski tourers and serves as a base camp for summit attempts of Aoraki/Mt Cook. \n\nNew Zealand’s backcountry huts are one of my absolute favourite subjects to illustrate. It’s an indescribable feeling to reach one of these huts after a gruelling hike through often difficult terrain. They are not just shelter from the harsh New Zealand elements, but are a deeply communal experience where you can huddle around and share stories and memories.  \n\nI love this image and am super proud of it. \n\nThe first collector will receive a physical Fine Art Print.",
