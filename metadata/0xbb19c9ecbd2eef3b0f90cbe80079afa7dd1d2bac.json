    "description": "“Pursuit of Permanence” is a commission of anthotypes created for Galaxy Digital. A series of plant specimens were generated using an artificial intelligence model, which were then physically printed out on transparency film and overlaid on paper. The paper, coated with an emulsion created from leftover produce from the artist’s fridge, was then exposed to sunlight for several hours to create delicate photograms of the artificial plant specimens. Working with the ethos of the blockchain as being a permanent record of information, immutable, and unchanging, “Pursuit of Permanence” aims to immortalize these prints as documents of past, present and future. The physical prints will fade over time, whereas their digital counterparts will be saved; specimens of a virtual herbarium awakened through an archaic photography process and stored back into cyberspace. Through this body of work, the artist hopes to inspire the viewer to explore sustainable ways to create art in their own practices.",
