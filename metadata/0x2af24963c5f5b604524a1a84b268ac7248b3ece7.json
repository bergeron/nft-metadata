    "description": "New York lives within its own unique bubble. A glistening cascade of skyscrapers reaching out to the heavens, and a bustling colony of human ants dancing its tune on the streets below. You could spend your entire life in New York and never take the same photo twice. Every building, every street, every person, every scuff on the pavement, every advert in a window, every car on the road tells a story. New York, if nothing else, is an anthology. A collection of exciting tales all intertwined into one, tales of love, loss, heartbreak, laughs, and everything in between.\n\nThe best advice you can give to any visiting New York is to open their eyes and breathe in the city. Wake up before sunrise and only sleep once the sun sets. Walk, run, and explore until your feet can do no more. For in the city that never sleeps, you can either be a spectator peering in from the outside, or you can embrace the streets and become another chapter of that famous anthology.\n\nNew York, New York… oh, what a city.",
