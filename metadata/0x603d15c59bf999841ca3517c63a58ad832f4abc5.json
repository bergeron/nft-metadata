    "description": "“Flavors” by Matthew Chaim featuring Jamee Cornelia is a taste of pure delight. Songwriter, artist, and Songcamp community leader Matthew Chaim actually got his start as a rapper. His singing approach flows thick like honey with embodied, raspy tones that are equal parts sweet and savory. On “Flavors,” Jamee matches his vibe flawlessly, their tones pairing together like fine wine. Based in Atlanta, James is multi-disciplinary artist, Head of Artist Relations at Glass Protocol, and has been dropping music NFTs since 2021. The duo met during a Songcamp session, and the rest is history. \n\n----\n\nThis is the tenth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
