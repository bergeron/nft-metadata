    "description": "What do you see when you gaze into the flames? This series depicts surreal and psychedelic collages of color, shapes, and figures hidden within one of the four basic elements. I find fire to be entrancing and am fascinated by its mystical and mysterious qualities. Change the way you see it, and who knows what youâ€™ll find.\n\nPhotograph taken by me and manipulated using Procreate. ",
