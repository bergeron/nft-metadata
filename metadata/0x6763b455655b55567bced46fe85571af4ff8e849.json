    "description": "once our character was an ordinary person, a member of society, a decent family man, an example for his children and a loving husband for his wife. Once, one terrible day, Food, who was sitting in the office, received a call, the police said that a gang of maniacs attacked his house and brutally finished off his family without leaving a trace of the Food family, what he heard shocked him and he fell unconscious, waking up he tore off his skin from his face and immediately went in search of the killers of his family, it turned out that while he was unconscious, a demon of revenge appeared to him and offered him to become his vessel in return, promising to brutally avenge his family, and so Ed turned into a monster that flayed his skin of his face, he found everyone who hurt his family and brutally gutted their bodies, now Ed or as the local townspeople began to call him the demon of revenge, he rides on his bike and takes revenge on every criminal who has ever bled an innocent person\n",
