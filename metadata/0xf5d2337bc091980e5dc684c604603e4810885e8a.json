    "description": "Where I was just under a year ago to where I am today. What I have seen, done, figured out and begun to understand. Why am I doing what I'm doing and going where I am going. The reasons, drives, desires. Many moments of awakening. So much breaking down to build up. No easy path, no guides, just ideas, hopes, dreams.\n\nI live to do what I do. I would not, could not, do anything else. I fight to be myself, understand myself, in a world that does nothing but try and compress all of who I am into a mold. \n\nLooking back, looking forward, what is, is. What will be, will be. All I can do is keep moving forward on the course I've set...adjusting as necessary.\n\nWessel '22",
