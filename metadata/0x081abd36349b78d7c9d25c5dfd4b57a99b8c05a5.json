    "description": "The 52-hertz whale is an individual whale of unidentified species that calls at the unusual frequency of 52 hertz. Its call has been detected regularly in many locations since the late 1980s, and appears to be the only individual emitting a whale call at this frequency. However, the whale itself has never been sighted; it has only been heard via hydrophones. It has been described as the \"world's loneliest whale\".",
