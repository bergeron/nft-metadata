    "description": "Fire & Ice is a single image long exposure taken at Mt. St. Helen's in Washington State. Faintly behind the mountain, the Milky Way showed itself off while the sun setting in the west created a vibrant orange glow on the clouds.\n\nI loved being at this spot at the right time to capture such a unique shot. I came out to the mountain this evening not expecting much due the moon but left with quite possibly one of my all-time favorite images. It is moments like these that keep me striving to move forward with my photography career.",
