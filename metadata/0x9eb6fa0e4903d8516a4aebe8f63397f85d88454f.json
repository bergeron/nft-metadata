    "description": "The first piece in the Urban Symphonies series. \n\nFollowing a period of absence from city life, these works were created on return to familiar cosmopolitan life. A visual translation of urban acoustics, these pieces explore the acoustic movement and weave of harmony and discord found within the ‘Urban Symphony’.  On a deeper level, this medley of beats and pitches are an audible expression of the human condition, ranging from joyful  crescendo, to, at times, jarring screeches and allusion of more painful existence. Within the melting pot of circumstances all sounds blend and jar to play the ‘Urban Symphony’ of city life.  As such, these pieces are also an expression of blended diverging worlds and diversity. \n\nAll pieces are digitally hand-drawn. \n\n",
