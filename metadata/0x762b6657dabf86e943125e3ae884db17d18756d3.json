    "description": "In a banking city made up largely of tall, minimalist, elegant skyscrapers, this motif seemed almost out of place. Like a fragment of a foreign city, a foreign country. \n\nIt was the first photo I took on one of my walks through the city of Frankfurt am Main. Funnily enough, I started this tour in a very rustic Italian restaurant. This gave me a certain holiday feeling, which made this picture even more inspiring.",
