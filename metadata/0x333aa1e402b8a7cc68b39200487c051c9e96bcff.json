    "description": "This piece is representing the strong connection between all human beings although it can be hidden sometimes. It is illustrating how every person is connected to one another and they are creating one wholeness even if not noticing it.\nAs Alan watts said: “all this universe is one 'ThaThaTha.' That means 'ten thousand functions, ten thousand things, one suchness,' and we're all one suchness.”\nYou can see many human faces with different expressions in their eyes just as we do as human being. We have different emotions at times. Some are happy, some are sad, some are confused or curious. But after all, we have to remember that there is one big energy that goes through all of us and surrounds us. We ARE that energy! Our power is limitless.\nDon't forget to be kind to people and you will see your life change because you get what you give :)",
