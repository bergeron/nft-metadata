    "description": "'Cadence' is the first of six pieces in the Hands of Time series. Developed with Transient Labs, 'Cadence' combines aerial photography with cutting edge technology to create art that displays the hour of the day based on the viewer's local time. Art deserves to be displayed and viewed in all its glory, therefore, I will be providing an NFT display to the winning bidder in order to display this NFT Art Clock. US Shipping will be covered.",
