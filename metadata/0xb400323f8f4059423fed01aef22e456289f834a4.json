    "description": "Completed in 1937, *Guernica* is one of Picasso's most famous oil paintings, and one of the most powerful anti-war paintings to ever exist. \n\nIn this rendition, I chose the dark blue, red, light blue, and yellow colors in particular to represent the flag colors of both Russia and Ukraine. \n\nRussia and Ukraine were the same country for the longest time in history. They share very similar cultures and values, and war and hatred are definitely not part of them.\n\n*Guernica 2022* aims to be a reminder that while times change, the bad side of human nature does not. Greed for power, domination, and control still persist until this day. I hope that the leaders of our times understand that EVERYONE loses in a war, and that today we have weapons that cause far more unnecessary damage than old times. \n\n**50% of all proceedings will be donated to help innocent people affected by this war.**\n\n3840 × 2160 | 300 DPI | JPEG",
