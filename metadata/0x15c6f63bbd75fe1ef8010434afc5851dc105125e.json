    "description": "Meet Najin, one of two remaining northern white rhinos on this planet. Next to her, Jacob (right) and Peter (left) her keepers, who take it in turns to stay with her -- and her sister Fatu -- 24/7.\n\nPeter and Jacob dedicate their lives to the betterment of our natural world. They see Najin and Fatu as their responsibility not only as rangers, but also as human beings. We are all, regardless of geographic location, responsible of their species' plight. Similarly, we are all responsible for their future. \n\nThese two amazing men represent everything good about people. Their inherent connection with Najin and Fatu is like nothing I've seen before. It is an intimacy that the majority of us have lost, a bond that has been siphoned away by the modern world.\n\nThey, Peter and Jacob, are the frontline. Our Bastions of Hope.",
