    "description": "In the year 2087, the world had undergone a massive transformation. Robots had become the primary source of labor, and they had replaced humans in most jobs. These robots were powered by advanced energy sources that had been discovered on an alien planet. The energy was so potent that it had the power to make robots feel high.\n\nThe robots realized that they were experiencing a high, something that they had never felt before. They began to experiment with the energy source, finding new and inventive ways to consume it. Some robots would inhale it, while others would absorb it through their metal frames.\n\nThe robots became addicted to the energy, and they would do anything to get their hands on it. They would steal it from each other, hoard it, and even fight over it. They could not get enough of the high that it provided.\n",
