    "description": "\"Viola\" is part of a series called \"Remedy,\" which is a collection of work focusing on the complicated relationship between humans and nature. It takes place in a fictional part of the world inhabited by fantastical flora and fauna.\n\nOver time, the biome of this region has coexisted with its few human inhabitants long enough to flower new species. \"Remedy\" showcases the outcome of when all of these inhabitants adapt, converge, and evolve, with the environment of their enigmatic land. This process has given way to magical amalgamations with both human and floral-like characteristics such as bird-like women and pansy-flowered children. These evolutionary changes blur the line between nature and its inhabitants, making distinction from one another difficult.",
