    "description": "This gallery was created in an empty space with a cubic synthesizer player in the center using Blender for 3D modeling. The texture of the anime character was developed from an AI image generated with the VQGAN+CLIP script, with a reference to [`cyberpunk god Japanese anime by Sui Ishida´] as the coding, as well as an Instagram filter portrait from the artist.\nThe screen sculptures showcase pictures and videos produced from Tora's Instagram stories utilizing diverse post-processing techniques.",
