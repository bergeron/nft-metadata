    "name": "Master of Puppets",
    "description": "Once there was a puppeteer named Jack who loved nothing more than building new puppets. Each one was a work of art, crafted with care and precision. He spent hours in his workshop, carefully piecing together wood, cloth, and string to create characters that came to life in his hands.\n\nJack's puppets were famous throughout the land for their lifelike movements and expressions. He performed with them at fairs and festivals, delighting audiences of all ages. But for Jack, the true joy was in the building.",
