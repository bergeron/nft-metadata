    "description": "In many ways, this artwork serves as a commentary on the nature of modern life, where we are constantly connected to our devices and work, and where the line between digital and real life has become increasingly blurred. The lonely room with the always-on computer and clock that never stops serves as a reminder of how easy it is to become disconnected from the world around us, and how important it is to find balance and take time to detach and recharge.",
