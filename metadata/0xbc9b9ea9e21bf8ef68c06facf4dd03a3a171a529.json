    "description": "*Giant's Causeway - Item 1/4*\n\nThe Giant's Causeway is a mystical place in North Ireland. The legend reminds us to work smart with our energies and to not fear our inner and outer enemies. The 60 million years old basalt columns have 5, 6, 7 or 8 corners. Most of the columns have 6 edges. The shape of the columns is the result of a special cooling process of the magma from which they were formed. You can get an idea of eternity and a boost of your spiritual energies from that place.",
