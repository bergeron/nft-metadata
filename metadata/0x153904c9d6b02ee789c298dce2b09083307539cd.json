    "description": "Taken in Pampanga, Philippines back in 2019.\n\nThis is a catholic tradition in the Philippines called \n\" penitensya \" which is done during the holy week. It is done to show regret and to ask forgiveness of their sins. Although this is not endorsed by the catholic church, there are still a lot of people doing this especially in the provincial areas in the Philippines.\n\nParticipants first cut themselves multiple times on their backs and hit their backs using a whip with bamboo sticks attached in it. In extreme cases, there are participants who also gets nailed to a cross.\n\n",
