    "description": "El Perro Andaluz is a story of metamorphosis, hope, connection, respect, and friendship between a human and her dog. It's a story of a dog that became a burden and was thrown away into the hands of death by his own best friend. He spent his days behind the bars, drowning in sorrow and despair until someone looked into his deep brown eyes and read the story he has to tell, they connected and a new tale was about to emerge. A new tale about a sad soul the was given a second chance and bloomed into a wonderful being, but it is also a tale about the magic bond that humans and dogs share and a tale about second chances.\n\nSpending his new days under the Andalusia sun, amongst beautiful flowers and orange blossoms, a girl puts together the last piece of his broken heart using the Kintsugi technique as symbolism for embracing the old and giving second chances. The dissipating black ghostly dogs stand for his past traumas of being on the death row, being beaten, starved, and living in terror.",
