In this NFT I am recording the story of what happened for all eternity! My painting was interrupted by phone calls from Ukraine, calls from my Mum and Brother and family in Ukraine. \n\nI would like to dedicate this painting to all my compatriots, refugees and Poles who have opened their hearts and homes.",
