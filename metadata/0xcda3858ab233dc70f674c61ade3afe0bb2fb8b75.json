    "description": "The origins of our birth start with an incubation process in our mother's womb. Despite a dark, constricted, and confined space - growth begins.\n\nIt happens with being uncomfortable when stretched to your tested limits, molded by circumstances, and shaped through trials and tribulations. Growth is a constant pursuit of capacity expansion.\n\n--\n\nvisions through the mind of the creator.",
