    "description": "The fabled Kraken Anchor Doubloon - these mythical doubloons were thought to be lost to time after they disappeared during a horrific storm. A few were recently found by divers exploring a shipwreck, deep underwater. These rare, small mint numbered doubloons feature the Anchor symbol of the Seattle Kraken. They are a gift of the Kraken and are rarely bestowed.",
