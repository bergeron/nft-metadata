    "name": "MAFIA BOSS EINSTEIN",
    "description": "In the mid-20th century, amidst the American mafia's peak, only the most powerful people knew of Albert Einstein's true identity as a ruthless mafia boss.\n\nThis striking image captures the genius physicist in a high-speed car chase through the dark alleyways of the city, with his subordinates in tow. But Einstein is not one to be easily caught, and as the chase reaches its climax, he emerges from the car to finish off his pursuers, leaving their cars in shambles on the streets. This dramatic image highlights the strange and unlikely alliances that can form in the world of organized crime, and the incredible impact that even the most unexpected individuals can have on history.",
