    "description": "Meet Tyler, the musician who creates ambient soundscapes using field recordings of natural and industrial sounds. Tyler's next project involves creating a musical instrument that can be played using brain waves. They predict that in the future, music will be a form of telepathy.\n✦✦✦\nThis series of ZINE AI covers is an homage to printed fashion magazines that are almost impossible to imagine without a face on the cover. The ZINE AI covers feature faces generated by AI with the ZINE logo, which is ever-changing. Additionally, each cover story is also generated by AI.",
