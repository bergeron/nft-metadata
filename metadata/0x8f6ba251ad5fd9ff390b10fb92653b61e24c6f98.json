    "description": "The PUMA RB Materializer is the physical twin to the PUMA Unter Digital Wearable. \n\nBoth designs were developed with the metaverse in mind. Designed first in 3D and tested in augmented reality before physical samples were ever created. The physical products are a first-of-their-kind experiment with new materials, technology, and design.\n\nEach Materializer NFT represents a physical pair of shoes to be claimed later. Note that each Materializer NFT has a shoe size associated with that NFT. Shipping fees will apply upon redemption.\n\nTOS: https://blackstation.puma.com/terms-of-sale",
