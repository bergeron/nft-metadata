    "description": "This painting is the first 'Galateia' work of my long-term project 'Pygmalion Project'. \n\nIn ‘Pygmalion Project’, I try to complete a virtual statue called ‘Galateia’ in reference to the Greek myth of ideal beauty. I sensibly draw and paint different parts of a ‘beautiful’ body that are classified and digested by the AI memory as ‘right’. In this duo between artist and machine, ‘Galateia’ summarises the different views of beauty, assembling them together and completing the artwork.\n\nCurrently ‘Galateia’ is a digital sculpture and a selection of paintings but in the future, it could be expanded to video art, an IRL (in real life) sculpture or other physical materialisation. \n\n\nRecent event for this project : https://glogauair.net/open-studios/june-2022/hyunseo-cho/\n\nA gift to my collectors : Once every two months, I send a letter containing my work, creative process, and news to my collectors by e-mail.",
