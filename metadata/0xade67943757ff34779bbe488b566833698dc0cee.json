    "description": "Attempts is the first lot from Ania Catherine and Dejha Ti’s Privacy Collection. Attempt 1 is one of eleven unique works the series of choreographic attempts to establish online privacy (real or imagined). In this work, the body inhabits and hides inside a digital shell in the form of a translucent glass avatar, speaking to the pseudonymous nature of web3—pfps, usernames, wallet addresses—where one can ironically be known for being unknown. Exploring the tension between privacy and transparency inherent to the blockchain, as well as the contradiction of self-expression and anonymity online, the work portrays an evolving attempt at alignment that is never achieved. The title of the series, Attempts, is rooted in the understanding that online privacy is nothing but a series of attempts. Attempt 1 features an original score by Amon Tobin. Lot 00. (2022) ",
