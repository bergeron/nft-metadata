    "description": "A creator of beings, The Arc can seemingly conjure life from within itself. No one knows how long it has existed or for what reason it is here, but it has become a symbol in nearly every culture. Some worship and revere The Arc while others deeply fear it, as it is unnatural in every sense of the word.  \nMany including myself wonder... where did The Arc come from... and who created it? Are there more like it yet to be discovered?...",
