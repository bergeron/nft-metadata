    "description": "Summertime monsoon rains are a welcome sight in the parched southern deserts of Arizona.   Nogales sits as a small town along the U.S./Mexico border south of Tucson, and the rugged terrain and steep valleys are home to some of the prettiest thunderstorms in the entire state.  This low precipitation supercell, a rotating thunderstorm, produced severe weather including flooding and large hail, but I captured the end of its cycle as gave its last breath with a rainbow in view.
