    "description": "This set of three images are taken within milliseconds of each other. It is staggering how much beauty unfolds within these collisions that the naked eye is unable to see. They are frozen in time with the use of macro lens, flashes and high speed camera . There are single images not composites. It was my mission to ensure that they are exactly as they were taken out of camera, the only adjustment being the clean up of the black background.  Each one is completely unique.",
