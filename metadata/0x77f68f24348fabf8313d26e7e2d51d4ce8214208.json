    "description": "Planes are not real birds but still flying and majestic...  \n30R is the main Montpellier airport runway.\n\nThis photograph has a nice story in many ways, here is why:  \nThis shot was taken at an operative airport from a helicopter, allowing me to fly above working planes and shoot almost what I want.\n\nIt has been awarded in the \"International B&W Spider Awards\" in 2020, 3rd place.\n\nIt's an animated piece paired with a physical piece for Augmented reality use, you can print it yourself with a high-quality file provided or get the original print from me on ©Kodak Metallic + ©Dibond aluminum 3mm 40x60cm (15x24inch).  \nThe animation overlays on physical print when viewed through your phone.  \nHere is the example video:  \nhttps://www.philippesheraf.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AR_30R_f.mp4\n\nWhen I started animating this piece it gave it a new perspective, improved my creativity and to me, build a bridge between physical and digital art.",
