    "description": "This artwork I did in 2019 while I was visiting San Francisco for the opening of an International exhibition where my other work got the Silver Award. I had been in SF before and I had already pre-visualized the image. I came to Alamo Square with a concept in mind. Victorian buildings are in the foreground, Transamerica Pyramid in the background, \"SF in Layers\" came out exactly how I wanted it.",
