    "description": "Both hands waving Ogi fans While dancing in the wind and warm light full of flowers all around , Only I am happy.\n\nThe umbrella is just an ornament. Because I want the light to hit my body without the need to obscure the light This moment will last forever.\n\nEven if someone sees It wasn't something other people could understand. \n\nSimilar to being in the midst of nature But it's really just what I created. \n\nBut I believe that one day There will be a day when people will recognize the existence of the wind.\n\nEven today my body disintegrates into dust But this wind will carry my feelings in this moment forever. It's all in my heart.\n\nThe wind will be the thing that will carry my feelings for all things to experience. \n\nDo not be fooled by the lights that deceive your eyes, try to use your heart to touch it.\nCan you feel it? \n\nThe feeling of the wind.\n\n3800 x 4600 px\n30 MB\n",
