    "description": "Self Love #2\n\nA moody motel room in Black & White.\n\nShe gets to ease into the night and as it unfolds she letâ€™s go of the day she had.\n\nA mind, that enjoys the serenity and peace it brings.\n\nWhat a delight to enjoy some peace of mind. We go through every day, without taking a moment for ourselves, and I need it, we need it.\n\nLet go. Let it out. Let it be what it may. Make healthy habits become a thing, I deserve it and so do you.\n\nTake care of your mind, your body and your soul.\nLet it rest and be free.\n\nThis is a reminder to all females out there, cultivate habits of self love, you deserve it.\n\n- Shot on Pentax KX\n- Ilford HP5 Plus - 35mm\n- Shenzhen, China, 2022",
