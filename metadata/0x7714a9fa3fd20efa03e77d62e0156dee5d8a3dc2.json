    "description": "The Balete is revered as a dwelling for the tree and nature spirits  of both dreams and nightmares (dwendes, kapres, diwatas). Offerings were made to the Balete to make peace with these spirits and display the peoplesâ€™ respect. Today, the oldest standing Balete trees of the Philippines can be found in Manila, Luzon, and the Visayas, all said to be somewhere around 400 years old. \n\n\nIn an effort to challenge the existing body of AI prompt art, the DiwatAI Project explores pre-colonial Philippine mythology. All pieces were created using Midjourney and Dalle2. For a deeper dive into these stories, I encourage everyone to check out The Aswang Project.",
