    "description": "A human mind is filled to dominate and explore even beyond the sight of the eyes and this is often meet with anxiety with man having a timeline to succeed in whatever man endeavors. \n\nTo fight anxiety man needs to act blind toward the timeline for success, keep the mind out of panic and the mouth shut from worrisome words. \n\n“Sometimes when there’s a storm there’s a panic but it’s not easy to sail through the storm with a panic because you may be overridden by anxiety.” - Erigma Sen",
