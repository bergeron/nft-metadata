    "description": "Mushy Monsters are a playful collection of lovable little Mushies, bringing youthfulness to web3. Where every monster is uniquely their own. Mushies are unapologetically themselves. the mushiverse is a judgment-free, playful world, each a little different, but they coexist side-by-side in harmony. Whether they’re selling antler dust, inking ETH tattoos, planting mushrooms or diving for fish; they always support their fellow mush. Whatever life throws at them, there is always a shimmering-side; they don’t take life too seriously, they celebrate it.",
