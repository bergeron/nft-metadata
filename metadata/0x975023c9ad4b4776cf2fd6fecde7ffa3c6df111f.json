    "description": "Inspiration : Have you ever had a dream that you wanted to reach? Well, I have. Something we dream of but would be difficult in reality. But deep down, I always believe all dreams can come true; if we have a courage to pursue it. And when the day comes, we will experience true happiness and pride.\n\nStory : On the day when the sun is going down, two girls with their two cats set off on a journey to the beautiful stars they dreamed of reaching. They set off in a magical flying van. One cat opened the map and the other looked at the route. There was a sweet and warm fish bun by side. In the car, there was their favorite luggage. The journey surrounded by the aroma of drip coffee was such a happy journey. Even though gravity tries to push us down, there's not much the world can ruin our plans. I am committed to make sure these dreams we have will come true. Now, get ready to capture beautiful memories of the stars. Nothing can stop us. \n\nCollector get 3535 x 4952 pixel \n600 dpi JPG image.\n",
