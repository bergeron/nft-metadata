    "name": "Woody Riddlepecker",
    "description": "Riddlepecker is #5 of 10 in a series of DC inspired Rubber-Hose-Style Cartoon Characters from various studios. Walter Lantz' character Woody Woodpecker first appeared in the short- \"Knock Knock\" on November 25, 1940. That makes this Woody's 80th anniversary and granting him one of the coolest titles ever- Octogenarian! Mixing him with the Riddler seemed like a great fit- Woody's eyes and Tail were originally green, and his spikey red hair matches many renditions of the riddler.\nBeing that we are both mischievous red-heads named Woody , he was a must have for me and deserves the rank of Legendary NFT!",
