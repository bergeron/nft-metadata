    "description": "In my current body of work I continue my exploration of abstraction through mixed media painting and ceramics. My paintings re-imagine grand beginnings by blending drawings, text and diagrams. My ceramics play with classical forms and re-imagine them expressively with plastic colors. As a whole, my work is informed by intuition and myth in a process that reconciles the awkwardness, chaos, and beauty. I am interested in exploring a universal spiritualism through a colorful, often humorous lens. Focusing on the activity of the artistic process, the themes of my work are determined by the unpremeditated end result. Improvisation is very important in my practice. Every action requires a response in art making. Abstract forms take on the shape of birds, clouds, feet, flowers--loaded symbols that speak to individual memory, collective myth, and storied beginning.",
