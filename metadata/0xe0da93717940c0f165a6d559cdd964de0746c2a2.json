    "description": "One of my first favorite landscape photographs captured in 2015 where it opened my eyes to the possibilities of what photography could bring.\n\n\nI remember planning this trip to Hawks Bill Crag for quite some time when I started hiking through Arkansas. This morning, it was 3:00 AM when my alarm clock woke me up as I drove 2 hours out to this place. \nAs I closed the door to my car, I was surrounded by silence. I put my headlamp on and walked the unknown trail in complete darkness. Getting closer to the bluff, I can remember looking out into a dark abyss as the cool air through the valley washed over me.\nI sat down to take time to ponder as I waited for the sun to come up.\nThen it was time. The horizon lit up in a golden brilliance as the view slowly revealed itself as I stood on the edge of a new journey to capture moments that I could share with others.",
