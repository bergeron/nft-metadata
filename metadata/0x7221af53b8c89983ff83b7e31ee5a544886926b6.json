    "description": "Stars dance behind the towering sea stacks of Ruby Beach, on Washington's North West Coast. \n\nThis trip was formative in my journey as a landscape photographer. Myself and three friends piled into a land rover and raced around Washington and Oregon chasing epic landscapes and light. We barely slept in four nights, but it was all worth it. This coastline is very dear to my heart and I have since returned here many times, always in awe of the incredible formations the sea has carved from its eternal ebb and flow.",
