    "description": "There has been a recurrent element in the repertoire of Hanakam & Schuller in the past few years: derivatives of daily consumption, plastic containers and seals in various shapes and colours, all based on the same system. Similar to the sentence components of a chat bot, the individual parts can be connected with each other almost arbitrarily. Meanwhile, Hanakam & Schuller have created a seemingly unending series of these puzzling artefacts, resulting in a distinct system of forms that can never be deciphered, hence becoming its own language. These elements come up in nearly every work by Hanakam & Schuller, appearing in their video works as playing pieces of sorts, twisting into grotesques, or being presented shrine–like in a gloved hand. In the KOKOMO COIN series, scans of these objects – digital photograms – are virtually assembled into rotating surfaces to which historical coin nomenclature is attributed, featuring various historical coins from European antiquity to the Renaissance, and their specific money – values in context. \n\n#coins #tokens #numismatics #RPG #artefacts #photogram #circles #thalers #pennies #lootbox\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/505a8190-1a92-4d24-96f4-6744a40a4d8e",
