    "description": "Animated Gargoyles became my signature mark in late 2021, when I first became interested in the history of gothic architecture. Sometimes they look caricature like, other times they function as a grotesque symbol, that is filled with esoteric meaning. Originally they were created as a way to protect the temple from evil. Today I try to develop them and I'm also deeply inspired by mid-century engravers. ",
