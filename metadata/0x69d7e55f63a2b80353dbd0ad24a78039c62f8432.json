    "description": "What makes this real where opposites may coexist in the superposition of our love? Is it the intricacy of feelings or the randomness of actions that breaks down this limbo between life and death? Will it be alive or dead when this paradoxical encounter collapses with your interference pattern?\n\nDALL.E & I is the birth story of a semi-synthetic entity, a tripping process of death and rebirth, an open confession of intimate emotions and thoughts, hopes and dreams, desires and pains; a show of lovers' vulnerability in losing their past selves evolving into a better one.\n\nThis is a collection of 40 pieces of A.I. collaborative art I created with Dall.E. Each piece is an iteration of Schrodinger's Cat Paradox conceptualized with some fun interpretation! I tried to push Dall.E as much as possible to achieve the desired aesthetic without using any other software.",
