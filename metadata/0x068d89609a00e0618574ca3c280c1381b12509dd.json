    "description": "The world today has so much chaos and everyone is so busy that they miss noticing the calmness in their surroundings. \nA few of them who take a pause to admire and embrace this calm, be it meditating or just pausing to look at a nice sunset, goes a long way in their spiritual journeys.\n\nThis piece tries to demonstrates one such instance of being 'ONE' with nature in this urbanised world.",
