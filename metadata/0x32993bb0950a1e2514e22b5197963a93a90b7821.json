    "description": "Exquisite Corpse collaboration with the artist Lucarduca.\nI drew the left half, covered except for a small strip and send to Luca, to finish the right half.\n\nAbout 30 hours on my half, and it was loosley inspired by the book Solaris.\n\nI love working with Luca, he is so good at reading the exposed strip and weaving it into his incredible drawings.\n\nInk on paper 30x30 cm.",
