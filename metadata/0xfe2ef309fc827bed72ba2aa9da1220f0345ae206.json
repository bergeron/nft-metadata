    "description": "This song describes a point in time at which I felt like the odds were stacked against me and my back was to the wall. Coming from where I'm from, this isn't a space that's foreign to me. I had to learn to remain level headed and accountable for my role in getting to the position I found myself in and patient. No matter how bad it gets I always find a way out. I'm covered by the source.\n\nI wanted to offer this to anyone who needs to hear it at a time line this. No matter how heavy things get you've got the tools to get the weight up off you. \n\nEnjoy\n\nWritten & Performed By Scolla Fungwe\nProduced By Scolla Fungwe & Olin Troutman\nEngineered By Olin Troutman\nMixed & Mastered By Scolla Fungwe\nArtwork By Scolla Fungwe",
