    "description": "Graphite on paper  \n19.5\"x15\"  \nWinning bidder gets the original drawing\n\n\"Islamic Spain\" is a reflection of my identity as a Filipino-Muslim, which intersects with the cultural influence of Moorish Spain. Through the intricate architectural drafting and surreal dimensions of impossible physics, I aimed to create a fine balance of form that highlights the interconnected parts of the culture depicted in the drawing.\n\nThe Moorish influence in colonial Spain is an important aspect of the artwork, as it reveals the enduring impact of cultural exchange and transformation over time. By exploring the intersection of my identity with this historical influence, I sought to convey a deeper understanding of the complexity and richness of cultural connections.",
