It is that while you dream there is so much to hold on to.\n\nYour imagination feeds like a pigeon, hoping that from the mystery the food will come straight to its beak, and it grows unrestrained. And while you lie among faces that do not see, feeling pleasure, pain, and everything in between, you wonder about the mystery that grows in the grass.",
