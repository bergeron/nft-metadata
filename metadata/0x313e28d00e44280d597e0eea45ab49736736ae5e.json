    "description": "Cape May, New Jersey is one of my favorite Summer haunts.  I vacation there most summers.  One of my favorite things to do is climb the Cape May Lighthouse.  The light has 199 steps and was built in 1859.  It is an active lighthouse that still guides ships from the Atlantic to the Delaware Bay.  This evening, the sunset popped and created a beautiful sky and reflection!\n\nPhotographer: Jason Betzner\n\nYear Created: 2021\n\nLocation: Cape May, New Jersey\n\nCamera: Canon EOS 6D\n\nAperture: F/9\n\nISO: 100\n\nExposure time: 1/125s\n\nFocal Length: 70mm\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial settings and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
