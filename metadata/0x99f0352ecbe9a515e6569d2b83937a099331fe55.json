    "name": "BLCLK box1 papaya plant nr° #148/001 ",
    "description": "I will follow this plant and document its growth trough the minting of NFT until it will be planted in a garden, getting flowers and fruit. Each plant has a number and a specific place. This is plant (seedling) in the first black bo with number BLCK box1 nr° # 148/001\nI sew the grains of ONE papaya and 148 seedlings started to grow. \nWhile growing I transferred the seedlings into individual pots. I will have to repeat this process for at least another 2 times before the plant will be mature, get flowers and fruit.\nI do not know which variety of papaya this is.\nI will continu to photograph/document the growth of each plant. You can also buy the actual plant in order to grow fruit or enjoy the flowers in your house. Until then I will further cultivate this plant.\nThe leafs of the plant are very beneficial for your health. Please contact your local doctor/medicine woman or specialist before you start to eat. I hope the fruit will be as delicious as the one the I have eaten with the seeds.",
