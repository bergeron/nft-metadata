    "description": "For this photo I used a camera rotation, all the trees were made by hand with a double light blade.\n\nThis photo was taken using the light painting technique (Light painting is a long exposure technique with moving different light sources in front of the lens). You can also highlight objects or move the camera itself). Everything was done in real time in one shot without using Photoshop. Small color correction.",
