    "description": "This collection of three images compliments my Genesis piece - an image which changed my life. \n\nThe Genesis piece is also minted on Foundation.\n\nIn their own right, these images are superb captures of this unique and rare storm. The storm passed over False Bay in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nI captured these images around 1am one Friday night.\n\nAll photographed on film. \n\nDeveloping the film the following morning, revealed I had captured something very special.",
