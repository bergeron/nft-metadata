    "description": "This artwork may or may not be notable - ‚úî\n\nThis is the moment when a contemporary artist's pixelated profile picture transforms into their most recognizable and iconic work. This transformation symbolizes a journey from being undefined to becoming 'verifiably notable' in the art world.\n\nThe animated illusion of movement, inspired by Banksy's \"shredder\" incident, further emphasizes the unpredictable and fleeting nature of value and the role of the artist in determining it. The pixelated profile picture also evokes the sense of not yet being fully seen. The shredder metaphor challenges the viewer to question whether they would dare to create anyway, despite the potential obstacles along the way.\n\nIn essence, ‚úîACKS is a commentary on the fluidity of art, value, status and recognition, paying tribute to the iconic works of artists like Jack Butcher, Banksy, and CryptoPunks' proliferation of pixel art.\n\nüñ§",
