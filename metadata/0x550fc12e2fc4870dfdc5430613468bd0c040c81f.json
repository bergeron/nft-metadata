    "description": "ジャロクゾ / Yarokuzo is a representative of a group of magical creatures, namely dragons. \n\nHis power is electricity. It is the only one of its kind, nothing is known about its origin.\n\n The age is several thousand years - this is no longer a young dragon. \n\nHabitat - ruins. Thought to have been dormant for centuries, it is said to have attacked human settlements when it was active. \nRenowned for its strength. \n\nAccording to legend, he was a free spirit who, in a fit of rage, killed his loved one (according to various versions, his brother / mother) and now, as a punishment, wears metal armor that limits him from all the joys of life, freedom, emotions and communication with spirits and the Divine. \n\nOften symbolically depicted with flowers - they personify his soul and repentance, which are torn out of the burden of crime, presented in the form of armor.",
