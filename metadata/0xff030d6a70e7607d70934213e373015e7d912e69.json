    "description": "\"The Last Citizen\" is a photo from Xian Cun area in the city centre of Guangzhou. This district has non-exist since 2015.\n\nChina is putting up buildings in leaps and bounds. Skyscrapers are springing up like mushrooms. Old residential neighbourhoods are being demolished on the spur of the moment and new ones are being built. Xiancun is one of a few neighbourhoods which hasn’t been demolished and reconstructed yet. Currently, the slums appear to be low-rise, half-abandoned and very dense housing.\n\nThere is an ongoing confrontation between the residents and the authorities. The residents don’t want to sign papers for pulling down their homes and the authorities are trying to force them out by giving them hard times in every possible way – they bulldoze markets, limit trash pickup, ban commerce, etc.\n\nAuthor: Vitaliy Raskalov\nEdition 1 of 1\nLocation: Guangzhou, China\nResoultion: 5186 × 3613",
