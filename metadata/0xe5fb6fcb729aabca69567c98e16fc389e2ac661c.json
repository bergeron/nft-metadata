    "description": "Today our cities are often described as concrete jungles. Urban sprawls of cement and glass. Clinical and brutal. \n\n'The Forest Becomes the Architecture' is a series of studies that aims to question this reality, and spark the imagination to ask; what if?\n\nWhat if there was a world where cities and forests grew together in harmony?  \n\nWhat if space and structure could be woven into the fabric of the forest? \n\nWhat if architecture was interconnected with the jungle; and the jungle was interconnected with the architecture?\n\n'The City of Trees' is a sub-collection of images that I feel expresses a  utopian reality to these prompts. Created in collaboration with Midjourney AI.",
