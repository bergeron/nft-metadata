    "description": "Eternal green\n\nTocco Vecchio is located on a tufa ridge with steep walls that extends in a north-south direction and rises towards the south. Despite numerous alterations and even though the built-up area has been reduced by a series of landslides, the village retains much of its medieval urban structure. \nDue to a series of landslides in the 1950s and then the earthquake of 1962, the village was evacuated and has been abandoned since then.\n\nIn the photo you can see the main street Via Carlo di Tocco that runs once the length through the village. There were many stores, such as a bakery, a butcher's store and a cafe.  \nEven today, the balconies of the houses where once hung laundry and the residents talked loudly, tower above the street. Despite all the destruction and decay, you can still feel the past here",
