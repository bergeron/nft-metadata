    "description": "What started out as a MEME, The Metaverse Song was first written and produced by JLEE using touch screen instruments using a free app on her smart phone. After being specifically requested by a fren named QUEEN, was then picked and strummed out LIVE in a Twitter Spaces just a little over a year ago, and has since then been performed hundreds of times over the last year in both clubhouse and Twitter spaces daily and has transformed into the live acoustic version we have all come to know and love today. We are thrilled to announce after much demand that we have now successfully collaborated with 20 incredibly talented 1/1 artists from within our community and have them available to mint on the ethereum blockchain as Digital Music Collectables also known as NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens).
