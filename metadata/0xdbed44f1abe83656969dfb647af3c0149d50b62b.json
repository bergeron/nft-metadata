    "description": "Being an astronaut is a dream of mine when I was a kid. I guess most boys do. I remember way back in our class during kindergarten. I already know a lot about the solar system and my teacher was shocked. Good thing my Mom used to buy me encyclopedias. Until now, I am still astonished by the beauty of the heavenly bodies. Now I'm an artist, I can create something that I can always imagine.\n\n\nThis project was created using my own photography combined with AI and post-processing tools.",
