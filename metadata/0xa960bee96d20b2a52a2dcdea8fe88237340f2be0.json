    "description": "the Solitary 321#001 by gelo\n\n \" The Solitary 321 (TS321) \" has been growing from the \" Floating World.” The composition of 3x buildings, 2x Lonely Guys, and 1x tree has exaggerated the solitary of the scene unexpectedly.\n\nAs same as the “ Floating World” series,  \" the Solitary 321\" is a collection of past architecture projects of mine in view of art. Designs had been accomplished in quality, yet being treated as actual projects. \" The Solitary 321\" is a simple attempt to bring forgotten memories back to an iconic style by reorienting time and space in various shades of materials within a frame.\n\nArt + Architecture by gelo\n\n4000px x 5000px\nFormat PNG\n",
