    "description": "Technique: acrylic painting based Vfx animation, 30 seconds, 1476x1920 pixel\nOriginal audio based on the theme of Arabesque by Claude Debussy\n\nOriginal painting: acrylic on paper, 51 x 75cm, created in 2022\nOption to purchase this physical painting is available (US$1000+shipping)\n\nMount Jade is the tallest mountain in Taiwan. For many, ascending to the main peak of the mountain represents overcoming life challenges. For others, it is a spiritual fortress. \n\nThis artwork reveals the characteristic peaks and beautiful contours of Mount Jade. The sky is painted with thousands of small dots of paint, reminiscent of impressionistic pointillism. The intricate line work of the physical painting gives the illusion of movement. Now in digital format, some of the contours and the sky are animated.\n\nThe original audio is based on the theme of Arabesque by Claude Debussy, re-created to have an ethereal and meditative effect, with an angelic choir singing, and bells chiming in the background.",
