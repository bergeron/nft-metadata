    "description": "No one thinks of flowers\n\nNo one thinks of fishes\n\nNo one wishes\n\nTo believe that the garden is dying\n\nThat the garden's heart is swollen in the sun\n\nThat the garden's mind is softly, slowly\n\nEmptying of green memories\n\nAnd the garden's perception seems to be\n\nAn abstract thing rotten in the garden's solitude\n\nOur house is lonely\n\nOur house\n\nYawns\n\nIn anticipation of the rainfall of an unknown cloud\n\nAnd our pond is empty\n\nInexperienced little stars\n\nFall to the ground from lofty trees\n\nAnd from among the pale windows of fish houses\n\nThe sound of coughing can be heard at night\n\nOur house is lonely.\n\n'Lyrics by Forough Farrokhzad'",
