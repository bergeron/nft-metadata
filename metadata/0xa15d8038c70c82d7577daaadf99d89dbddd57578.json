    "description": "Alaska is one of the most remote regions of the world but also one of the most beautiful places in this blue planet called earth.  \nFull of forest, glaciars and majestic mountains . It's a harsh and challenging place but at the same time is a place where you can fall in love with such epic landscapes.  \nThis frames were made while i was flying above Chugach state park in Anchorage during a beautifull sunrise.  \nThe light created gave a special colours to this amazing set of mountains and glaciers.\n\nFujifilm Xpro1+ Viltrox adapter+ Nikkor lens 28-105mm + iso 320mm+shutter speed 1/125 seg.",
