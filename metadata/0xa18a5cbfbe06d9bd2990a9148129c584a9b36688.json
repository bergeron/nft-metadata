    "description": "I dream one day of artistic solitude, just the birds, the water and the expanse of nature. A space where my mind can unravel, leaving my soul naked to cleanse in the sun.  Where my dreams can frolic on canvas or in prose. \nPainted is a lake surrounded by mountains, a solitary home with a boat house, a pier and a boat. The birds represent the freedom that I crave, to glide with wind under wings. \nPen, copics and water color paints on water color paper. ",
