Launched with a free online comic book and a series of digital pixel “ETHBot” NFTs, TGL raises money for public goods by engaging the community. In a comic book wherein Ethereum’s forces inside the Quadratic Lands are crushed by Moloch, the god of coordination failures, only freeing 200 ETHBots will open the alternate comic ending, where the ETH forces coordinate to save their city.
