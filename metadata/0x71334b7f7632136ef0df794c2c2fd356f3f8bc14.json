    "description": "Have you ever felt stuck in the world, a world full of shapes and shades? The world seems to enter into a state of being paranoid, about the connections, creations and the whole idea of the universe. \n\nSometimes, everything feels so connected in layers yet at the same time, it feels so different. Muddled in the huge heaps of thoughts and couldn't able to realise the essence of the situation and managed hard to cope with the whole idea of the world which denotes the wonders and unimaginable potential of mankind. It indicates an ever-existing entity but still, it remains a hideous idea of the world. \n\nBeing lost in a world where everything feels connected yet nothing actually is connected makes an interesting, at the same time confusing state of fact. The fact which remains zoomed up but in the long run, it seems like tiny little dots where the mystery of the minds and the world of wonder remains unleashed.\n\nDetails ~\n\nArt type: Generative  \nDimension: 5000 x 5000  \nCreated using: p5.js",
