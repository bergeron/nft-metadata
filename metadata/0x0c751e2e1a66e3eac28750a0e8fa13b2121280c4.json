    "name": "SIVASH - \"Unnecessary thinking\"",
    "description": "Exploring the human psyche's constant struggle for clarity amidst the chaos, \"Unnecessary Thinking\"  captures the essence of an overstimulated, dual-minded individual. As we gaze upon the double-headed protagonist, we are reminded of the battle between our rational and emotional selves, a profound reminder of the importance of balance in our increasingly complex world. This artwork beckons us to ponder our own mental battles and the consequences of the choices we make in this ever-evolving digital age.\n\nSIVASH is an Austria-based Russian sound and visual artist, currently working with AI in the visual domain to explore impossible and futuristic concepts of reality. Driven by the feeling of universal unity and divine design, SIVASH transfers it into the form of art, exploring reality and its forms and pushing the boundaries of our imagination.\n",
