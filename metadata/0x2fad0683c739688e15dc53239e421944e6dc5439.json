    "description": "The pieces consist of celestial beings, all inspired by the great forces that move our universe: some based on scientific things like magnetism, electricity and heat; others are more conceptual, such as the void and tribalism. From these entities, like a big bang, pieces of the universe emerge, which go to compose magnificent spatial visions: dwarf stars, supergiants or pulsar stars that illuminate planets, moons and asteroids. Accessory elements, which act as masks for the faces, and artistic components, which orbit around the Entities, enrich the whole. Everything against the backdrop of magnificent galaxies and nebulae of the main colors.",
