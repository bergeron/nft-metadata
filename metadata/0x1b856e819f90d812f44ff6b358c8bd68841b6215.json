    "description": "\"Unchained\"\n\nWe all experience it...The juxtaposition of what holds us back while simultaneously pushing us forward. \n\nDoubts. Hopes. \nFears. Ambitions.\nInsecurities. Confidence.\nWeaknesses. Strengths.\nFailures. Successes.\n\nAre we being held back or are we being forced to take a step back, to see through the struggle to find a way to achieve something even greater?\n\nIt's time to believe in yourself. It's time to take action. It's time to become, Unchained.",
