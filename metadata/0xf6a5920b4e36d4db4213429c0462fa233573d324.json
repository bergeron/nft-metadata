    "description": "I am sad. There is a war in my country and my husband is in danger right now. He has no way to communicate and I don't know if he's okay. I guess that's all I have to worry about right now. I am really scared and it hurts a lot. But I am very grateful to you for your support. \n\nNext week I can try to return to Ukraine. I'll be driving for a few days. It's hard for me to say how safe it will be, but my city does not have much strategic importance. It is small. I will finally show my youngest son to my husband. He still hasn't seen his baby boy. I hope everything goes well with us. \n\nJuliSeven  \n16 Aug 2022",
