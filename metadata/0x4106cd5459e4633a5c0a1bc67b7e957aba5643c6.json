    "description": "I had a hope that I would be able to see one of these magnificent creatures while I was in South Africa. One day, while I was riding with the guide on the reservation there came a call across the radio that notified us that a cheetah had been spotted hunting nearby. \n\nWe slowly drove over the area and thankfully got there after the kill had been made. It was an incredible moment to sit and watch the circle of life. \n\nSize 2544 x 3014 / 8.25 MB\nEdition: 1/1   \n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, if the creator is credited.
