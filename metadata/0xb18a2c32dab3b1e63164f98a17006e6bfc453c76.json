    "description": "The Storm is an innovative interactive NFT project. Our NFTs react in real-time to tweets producing thunderbolts and light animations. Every lightning is originated from a tweet with a specific hashtag related to climate change topics. The aim of our project is to raise awareness about environmental issues and let you be in communication through an interactive artwork with a community sharing the same interest as you. Every time you see in your wallet your cloud reacting, you know that someone in that exact moment is “talking” about climate change and that something is happening. If you care about the Planet's future this NFT will let you see that you are not alone. It's a drop of hope. Part of the project profit will be donated to the non-profit organisation Rainforest Partnership. This NFT is connected with a real physical contemporary art installation called Nuvola (Cloud). The Nuvola has been exhibited in museums and art galleries in Italy since 2019. To learn more about it please visit https://nuvolaproject.cloud/",
