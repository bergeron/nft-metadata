    "name": "#01 - In Summer's Arms - Cyrille de Vignemont",
    "description": "Since his first exhibitions, Cyrille de Vignemontâ€™s work attracted attention in contemporary art world, from the Museum Of Contemporary Art, Shanghai, to the Museum of Modern Art PS1, New York, while his experimental films and very personal music videos have been screened at the British Film Institute in London, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, and at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nHis sensorial narratives encapsulate ephemeral moments, recollections of those instants when we feel connected to everything around us. This search for the impossible is perhaps what gives these images their abstract tension as they wallow in light.\n\nEdition 1/1\n4500 x 6000, Film Photography \n",
