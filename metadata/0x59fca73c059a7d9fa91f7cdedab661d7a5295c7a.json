    "description": "“Doze off” is a part of the “Somewhere not here” , which captures the everyday moments that I thought were wonderful - for example, on holiday afternoons, spending time with friends, spending time alone at a cafe, etc.- and express what I felt during these moments with neon light and abstract objects.\n\nThe concept of this piece is the moment when you fell asleep when you are relaxing alone.",
