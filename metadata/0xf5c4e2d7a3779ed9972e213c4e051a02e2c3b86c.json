    "description": "We need friends. Everyone does. Some people dont think so. I was one of those on occasion. I have been in many different  \"scenes\" over the years.

I have found this extraordinary. \n\nThis is a composite of elements rendered in 3d, AI components and post. It is a soft focus work that represents the serenity and support friends can mutually give to each other.",
