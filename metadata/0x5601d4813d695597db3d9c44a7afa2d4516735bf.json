    "description": "This work represents the concept of \"the elephant in the room,\" a metaphor for an issue or problem that is present but goes unacknowledged. It serves as a reminder to have the courage to address difficult conversations and issues, as they are fundamental to our growth. The title, \"Memory,\" refers to the idea of never forgetting where we come from and how our accumulated experiences shape who we are.  \n\nThe work is also a response to the difficult experiences that the artist, Lianna, faced in 2022, as well as the human rights crisis in Iran where protestors were silenced.  \n\nThe piece was created using Procreate, with the intention of conveying a sense of darkness or challenges through the use of a specific colour palette.",
