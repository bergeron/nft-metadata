    "description": "This series explores urban camouflage and collective metabolisms through bare gestures in public space. I wove together a ghillie suit made out of ‘Good Morning’ cleaning cloths and used mop heads. \n\nWearing this new skin, I haunt a food centre during dinner time on a Sunday, collecting dirt. What’s left behind on the floors? Is it the scraps of food, the dust tracked in from the road, the dead skin cells of other diners? \n\nWith thanks to Veronyka Lau and Cynthia Suwito Delaney\n\nVideo capture of artist in habitat | 18-sec | 28 January 2022 | Lau Pa Sat, Tanjong Pagar, Singapore \n",
