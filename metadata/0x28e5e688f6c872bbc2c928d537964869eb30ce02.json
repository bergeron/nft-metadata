    "description": "after a long lockdown as a result of the pandemic, I was lucky enough to see my mom again, we hadn't gone to the beach together for a long time, while I was taking a picture of her, this silhouette of a child playing in the sea appeared behind her, immediately I pointed my camera at him and captured what for me is the most beautiful photo I have ever taken.",
