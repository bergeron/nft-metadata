    "description": "It is intended to express the recovery of women's self and identity lost due to long-standing restraint and discipline\n\nIt is thought that the appearance of a woman choosing her own life and existing as a free spirit can be compared to flying toward the sky.\n\nThe abstract line of feeling was set as a tool to the corset representing women's restraint as an object personality, and to a situation of discrimination and oppression.\n\nThrough the process of fusing and dismantling corset shapes and lines, and reinterpreting them, women themselves expressed the feeling of flying as the subject of life.",
