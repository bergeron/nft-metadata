    "description": "Did you know that Djinns love sweets? Especially chocolate chip cookies. \n\nI didn't. I forgot to introduce myself... I'm light. And I go to a new place and a new form every time someone flicks a switch. I can become a lamp, or a lantern, or even a jar of fireflies. And I often see all kinds of strange things. Like today, for example.\n\nSee that girl in the green? One day she noticed a strange craving for djinn for sweets. So she started catching them and locking them in jars.  Seriously, what is wrong with today's kids?\n\nNo, she doesn't admire them, keep them as pets or use them as a nightlight. This young entrepreneur rents out djinns. You see, they know how to cast illusions. \n\nThere is little joy in this town, and plenty of people who want to disconnect from reality. Anyway.... Yes, this girl catches djinns in jars and rents them out for money to those who want to change their minds for a little while. \n\nHonestly, I even feel sorry for these guys. But the cookies smell amazing...",
