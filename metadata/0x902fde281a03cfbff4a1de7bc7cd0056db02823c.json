    "name": "Capitalist Propaganda",
    "description": "Capitalist Propaganda\n\nThe ruling private and political elite promote capitalism primarily through mass media, education, and other institutions. The goal is to maintain capitalist hegemony by positioning it as the supreme and only valid system, eliminating opposing viewpoints, and portraying non-capitalist views. It describes how propaganda is employed by the capitalist class to indoctrinate workers into acting against their own best interests.\nCapitalist propaganda aims to bind the working class to the interests of capital and is one of many attempts to do so in class struggles. In order to guarantee that capitalist interests dominate society at the expense of socialist ideas, the capitalist class spends vast amounts of money supporting political parties and owning the media. As noted in THE GERMAN IDEOLOGY (1846), those ideas which dominate in class society are those of the ruling class.\nA working-class majority with revolutionary potential has to be suppressed at all costs.",
