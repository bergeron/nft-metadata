    "description": "Horses are undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and noble creatures on our planet. It is impossible not to be impressed, especially when we see a horse that runs freely with its manes blown in the wind and dazzles with all its majesty when it rears.\n\nMankind discovered the horse as a riding mount. It is known that the first people to domesticate the horse in order to facilitate their nomadic life were the societies in Asia. This discovery provided them with ease all their lives, they became faster in battle. They used it for transportation.\n\nI took this photo in the salt lake. (Ankara/Turkey) In this photograph, we see a person integrated with his horses. He lives with them enthusiastically.\n\nI am a Turkish documentary photographer. \nI mainly work on **human and life** issues.\n**[\"More information about me\"](https://mustafacebecioglu.com.tr)**\n\nCamera: Nikon D7200\nLens: Tokina 11-16 mm\nDimensions: 5134 ×3361 \nResolution: 300 dpi\nLocation: Ankara,Turkey\nDate: 13/10/2019\nEdition: 1/1\n",
