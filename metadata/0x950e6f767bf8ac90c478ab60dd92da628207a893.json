    "description": "Walls appear and barriers between the rich and poverty...\n\nAngels are burning in hospitals while devils are dancing in a cathedrals\nLife is taken on a debt\n\nWolves no longer come out in packs, they gather in parties.. There is no faith, there is no honor, Kindness and respect no longer have any value...\n\nWe are pushed to a point where we value material things over people. We forget that things and money are supposed to be used, not loved. They should serve us, not control us as if they are our masters.",
