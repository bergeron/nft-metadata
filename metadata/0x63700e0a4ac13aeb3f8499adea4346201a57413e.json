    "description": "“Chrysalis” is a collaborative piece between Joyce Chen and Luke Parker .\n\nA meditation on transformation and finding our footing as people: we often find ourselves discussing what the next thing is and questioning whether we’re doing enough to get there. This piece is about a new discovery on that journey where we’re realizing that change happens slowly, with effort, step by step. And–probably, most importantly–that creativity and innovation can come from anywhere if you let it: bubbling up from even the murkiest of depths.",
