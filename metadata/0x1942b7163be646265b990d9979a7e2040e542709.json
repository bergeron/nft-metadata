    "description": "Quaternity is the first global intellectual E-Sport. Quaternity is now able to offer a unique opportunity to claim a seminal place in Quaternity history: a Limited Edition of only 10 Quaternity Original Founder Board NFTs. These will be followed by other Quaternity NFTs, but there will only ever be 10 Quaternity Original Founder Boards. Each of these 10 NFTs comprise 2 parts: a unique 30 second Generative Art Video, inspired by the art of early 20th century artist Kazimir Malevich, and a ‘Quaternity Board’, based on a unique single art frame from the Generative Art video, which magically transforms into a playable Quaternity board when on the https://www.play.quaternity.com digital platform.\n Preview: https://preview.quaternity.com/1",
