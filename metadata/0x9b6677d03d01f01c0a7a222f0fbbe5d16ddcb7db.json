    "description": "SquatDAO   This is one for the squatters!  Goal: Form a community that govern the SquatDAO.   Through the SquatDAO we will compete with the ENSFairy!  Together we hunt expired domains as a closed unity, squatting them until ROI is 69% or above. We split profits among holders or whatever the DAO decides. The Stronger the Portfolio, the higher the rewards.  The SquatDAO will use NFTS to vote on proposals and make decisions.  1 NFT =  1 vote - 1 share  This will allow us to govern the organization collectively and democratically.   The goal of the SquatDAO is to provide a decentralized, transparent, and autonomous way to manage an ENS Squat organization.  Lets build and grow together.  You wanna squat?   We got you!   Together we can squat on anything!",
