    "description": "This piece represents sapphic love in all of its beauty. It represents a love that should never be hidden. A love that I can’t do without, a love that tells me to be truly me, a love that I shouldn’t be ashamed of. A love that chose me back. A love that’s safe and patient and giving. A love that makes me a happy human being. A love that will always be home to me. It’s my favourite kind of love. It’s love with my darling. This is what queer love means to me - it’s passionate, it’s loving, it’s desire, it’s friendship. No matter what happens or whatever the future holds, I will always love this love and cherish our memories. So my darling, I hope you do too.",
