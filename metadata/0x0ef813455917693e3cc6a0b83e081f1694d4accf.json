    "description": "When I began working on “Singularity” I was inspired by the art of Giovanni Bellini and Raffaello Santi coupled with scientific studies and inventions of Da Vinci. When creating this piece my main goal was to imagine how modern interpretation of major themes of the Renaissance would look like and also to reflect on my experience as an artist who's been working with AI over the past few years.",
