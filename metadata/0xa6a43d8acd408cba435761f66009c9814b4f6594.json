    "description": "Since - 2004 | Made - 2022\n\nHello. I am glad to present you my first work for the NFT. My Name is Sasha, aka Vlasuhiro. I am from Ukraine. And... it is my trying to befriend with my inner child. Young Sasha's ideas from childhood with opportunities from 2022.\n\nAs a child, I loved cars and drawing, and always came up with cool things. When I was reviewing my old children's drawings, I knew for sure, that this what I needed! \"Wow, it's already a collection!\" - I thought)\n\nI drew these vehicle at the age of 11, in 2004. But now I'm 28 and I'm learning 3d modeling. I decided to take one of these concept cars from my childhood and make it in 3D for NFT. Cool! In first, I chose SV MULTI S2 R.\n\nIf the community supports me - I plan to make all my child collection for NFT. Love ðŸ’š",
