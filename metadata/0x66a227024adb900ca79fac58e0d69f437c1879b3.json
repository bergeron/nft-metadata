    "description": "A dear friend of mine happens to be a botanist and a very meaningful part of my life has been spent in the field becoming familiar with plants. I am very inspired by the inflorescence found in the plant kingdom. That is what inspired this piece and also a lot of what is to come. My art is very often directly inspired by a place and the feelings in the aesthetics found there.\n\nI love abstraction in almost all forms. I do find it challenging to strike the balance between abstract and perceptible representation. This is my challenge and one that leads me to constantly work in different mediums. \n\nFor this piece I wanted to capture the symmetry, delicate structures, panels of color, gradation, simplicity and of course draw one's attention towards the anther.\n\nThis is my genesis mint. \n\n~Raphael",
