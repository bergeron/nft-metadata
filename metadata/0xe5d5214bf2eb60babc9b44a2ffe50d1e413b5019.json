    "description": "“It's about the emptiness of the soul, but it's also about starting anew; when you feel nothing but finding the power inside of you to stand up and move.” In the teeth of aggressive destruction, Ukraine has been dealt a severe blow. In such circumstances, we all feel emptied and helpless. The world, too, drew back in horror. But the brave heroes of Ukraine have not stood down - they have risen to fight and win a brighter future. Now we all join together and stand as one. Traditional sculpture created by Sergii Shaulis.",
