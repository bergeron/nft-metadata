Too often people donâ€™t stick up for what they truly believe at the thought of not being accepted. \n\nThe proceeds from this song will fund a nonprofit DAO that gives free studio time to musicians in the web3. Holders of this song will get to nominate and help determine the artists. The studio space is located in Los Angeles to start and will be looking to partner with other studios around the world. ",
