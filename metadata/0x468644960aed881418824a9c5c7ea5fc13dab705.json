    "description": "An official David Johnston Edition of 50.\n\nThis waterfall is one of many on my favorite hike in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. My art is my heart, and I hope that this photograph brings you peace, joy, and a little relaxation when you look at it. Scenes like this allow you to detox from the hustle and bustle of the world and anchor you back into nature for some well-deserved rest. If this photo resonates with you, I'd love to hear your story.",
