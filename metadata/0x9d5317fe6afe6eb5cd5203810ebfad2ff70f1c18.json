Each piece is based on different materials.\n\nAccording to theories all the way from Tao to Goethe the realisation of supreme potential of a thing, can be achieved by allowing the nature of the thing to define our path around it. Just by being sensitive enough to flow around the subject and adopt to its nature.",
