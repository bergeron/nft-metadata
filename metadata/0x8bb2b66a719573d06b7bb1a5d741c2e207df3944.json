    "description": "Photos taken in Oruro, Bolivia in 2011 with the first camera I ever owned, a Canon PowerShot SD780 IS.\n\nLa Patria brings to life the richness in culture that Carnaval in Bolivia represents through the various dances and ornate costumes that are native to the country. Each photo represents a moment in time that reflects the joyful expressions of the dancers and the euphoric feelings that this annual celebration represents for Bolivians.\n\nBands from all over the country first started to come to Carnaval in the early 1900s. They provide the melody, rhythms, and beats for the dancing groups to perform.",
