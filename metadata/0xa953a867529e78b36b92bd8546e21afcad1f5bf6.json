    "description": "Image #1 in the Bahamas Collection. I captured this topdown aerial photo of Oasis Lagoon on the island of Coco Cay in the Bahamas. This is the largest pool in the Caribbean. This shot is super unique because it was taken on the private island of a major cruise line in the Bahamas. It took some advanced coordination, but I ultimately was given special permission to fly my drone here where most people are not allowed to fly drones.",
