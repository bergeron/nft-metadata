    "description": "If you've delved into NFTs at any point, chances are you've encountered a Poko Bear. They're ubiquitous in Discord and chat groups, typically espousing \"NGMI!\" as their battle cry. Poko Bear, the quintessential embodiment of those who proclaim \"NGMI!\", has become such a fixture that it would be odd not to see one in these spaces. \n\nTherefore, it's hardly surprising that certain Poko Bears have gone so far as to advocate for an outright ban on minting and possessing a Boko Bear, under the belief that it indicates defeat. Whether or not you agree with this sentiment is left for you to determine.",
