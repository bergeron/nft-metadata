    "name": "ONE MORNING ON THE CORAL REEF",
    "description": "She dives into the water breaking the pristine, glistening surface to sink down into depths undiscovered. As morning light infiltrates the sky above her head, she sinks further into the blue and the pressure of the ocean world begins to tighten and compress her lungs. Shadowy silhouettes from the corner of her eye cut through the water like kites in a clear blue summer sky. Shoals of tiny rasbora swirl into formation and she is distracted by the shards of light reflecting out from the seabed. Bound and gagged,  the Goddess of the ocean reveals her treasure in a cacophony of colour and texture through eyes filled with emotion. The predator approaches from out of the calm and in that moment her greed outweighs her fear. She takes her chance and sacrifices it all. â€¨\n\nPIXELS: 5906 X 8187",
