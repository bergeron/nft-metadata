    "description": "Charity DAO has released their latest NFT collection - Reducing Poverty and Boosting Resilience in Ukraine. Our artists decided to feature dogs to represent humans from different levels of society in Ukraine.  The NFTs are reflective of their daily lives and the impacts of the living conditions in poverty.  Some of the NFTs show dogs with their clothes in tatters, a black eye, but they maintain a sense of pride through perfectly trimmed beards. \n\nDid you know that there are more than 700 million people (10% of the world's population) still living in extreme poverty, and their most basic needs such as health care, education, water and sanitation are not met.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has triggered a major humanitarian crisis. The prolonged conflict will push an estimated 30% of Ukraine's population below the poverty line, while another 62% are at risk of falling into poverty within a year (United Nations Development Programme, 2022).\n\nThere are still a lot of people suffering and living in poverty globally, especially people in Ukraine. Let's go hand in hand and work together to eradicate poverty now! You can do so by supporting Charity DAOâ€™s NFT collection - Reducing Poverty and Boosting Resilience in Ukraine.",
