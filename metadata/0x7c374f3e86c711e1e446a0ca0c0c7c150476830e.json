    "description": "I describe the figure of a Baby as a symbol of birth with its own color that has various elements of life. Various kinds of ornaments on the Baby's body have their own character and meaning. I painted this story with Psychedelic Artstyle and use a mix of bright colors as my Original identity. Combines many colors that have many deep meanings. The various colors of the background are described with many calm colors that also have their own meaning.\n \n",
