    "description": "bloody lake... she was a girl who fell in love... but she couldn't find where her love was. One day, a voice from the depths of the forest drew him into his forest. He was looking for his love. darkness fell. and a fear gripped him. With the howling of the wolves he began to run. he tripped and fell. He looked up and realized that he had come to the edge of a lake. He heard a creak in the pitch black. and it was surrounded by wolves... and then the lake was covered in blood... the name of the lake has remained \"bloody lake\" ever since.
