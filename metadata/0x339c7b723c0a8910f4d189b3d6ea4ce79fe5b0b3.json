    "description": "\n\"The Europa House\"\nA Genesis project by ArchitectureofMetaverse.com\n\nThe inspiration is from one of the icy moons of Jupiter - Europa.\nJupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and has about 79 moons!\nOne of its largest moons is “Europa” with an icy surface and gases surrounding it. The Architect’s imagination makes Europa a place to design a dream abode.\n\nThe House is fully designed inside and out so that it can be of actual utility once Metaverse is live. A walk-through of the Digital Building along with the soothing eastern \"Om\" chants can be seen here. \n\nAfter the successful purchase of the NFT, The original 3D File of the House will be shared with the buyer upon request which can be later used to integrate with the Metaverse. So this is an art in which one can live.\n\nThe Europa House while blending with its surroundings overlooks the magnificent Jupiter in the sky.\n\n(Designed by Architect Sujan Setty, Founder of Furgonomics.)\n",
