    "name": " Meeting the crow ",
    "description": "A mysterious descent from the inner darkness and thrown into the inner light ... A dark glance with open and rich wings through the history of ancient and new civilization...\nI was born of darkness, and unbridled and disturbed by the volume of loneliness and nostalgia for freedom from the cage of the body that I carried with me; waited for the Crow the messenger (who is the result of life, brightness and light of existence) comes from black with black wings to give me hope for moving… a window is opened inside me which its beautiful light illuminates the whole universe and accommodates the crow and integrates infinite whiteness with him... \nEverything started with the crow, my wings were born and woven into him, fly and guidance of his gaze takes me to the greatest parts of me and leaves me in truth… how beautiful is freedom and union and walking in liberation and freedom and flying...fly... becoming feather... flying. \n",
