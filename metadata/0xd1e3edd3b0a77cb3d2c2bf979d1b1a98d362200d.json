    "description": "\nThe Queen of Java is an NFT artwork inspired by the legendary figure of Ratu Kidul, a powerful Indonesian queen who was said to have mystical powers. She is often depicted as a beautiful woman riding a sea dragon and was an inspiration to generations of Indonesian artists and poets. Her story is one of unwavering courage, strength and power, and her NFT artwork captures the essence of this iconic figure. The artwork serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of female leadership, and has personally inspired me to strive for greatness and to never give up.",
