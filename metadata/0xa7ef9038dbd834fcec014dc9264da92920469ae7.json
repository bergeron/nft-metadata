    "description": "Dream Runners is a collection that I'm making into a 5K collection of Dreamers that will be doing more than running and will vary in traits, this specific one is a special one as it's gold and in my mind symbolizes the morning (GM!.)\n\nThe project goal is to create a Motion like collection of NFTs that encapsulate characters with different dreams that are relatable.\n\nI'd like to create a community of like minded people who are dreamers and doers like myself.\n\nI'm putting this up for auction to fund the project, your support will help me hire more artists, and devs other than myself as I'm a one man team.\n\nI've been in NFTs since BAYC was 0.5ETH & am currently looking to make Web 3 a FT job. Right now I just do it on the side.",
