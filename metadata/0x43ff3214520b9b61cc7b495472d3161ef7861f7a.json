    "description": "Innovations are not always accepted. In order to stay together and ensure its continuity, societies strive not to deteriorate the culture they have created with an external influence. Innovative ideas and discourses are always considered taboo in such societies. When the society, which has common prohibitions and ethics, is examined individually, there is no partnership. Those who are considered taboo and who speak the unspeakable have always initiated innovative movements in the history of culture. Innovative thoughts want to break tradition by using art. In the modern world, the question of existence of every individual who carries the burden of tradition and follows innovations stands out. \"Is this real life?\"",
