    "description": "Featuring the famous Atlanta Beltline, this shot reminds me of a practice a lot of photographers use which is to \"hurry up and wait\". Chasing the sunset I was waiting for just the right moment, I got the chance to catch a bicycle rider in the sunset looking over the downtown skyline. Perfectly capturing the active Atlanta lifestyle ",
