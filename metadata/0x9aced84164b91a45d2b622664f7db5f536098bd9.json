    "name": "Dance of the Bald Eagles",
    "description": "Every November, Bald Eagles migrate to Haines, Alaska, to prey for salmon on the Chilkat River. \n\nThis is when the Chilkat River is half-frozen and the salmon are swimming very slowly up the river.  \n\nThe Bald Eagles are waiting on the trees for their opportunity to “bag” fresh fish.  \nWhile diving from the trees to the river, they sometimes crash into each other and by shielding their talons they avoid harming each other.  Their talons are sharp as a razor blade.\n\nIn this photograph, the Bald Eagles are diving for the salmon and just before they crash into each other their eyes “lock” and their talons meet.  \n\nThis is a uniquely powerful shot of a nanosecond movement in nature.\n\n1/1 Edition NFT\nFull size HD jpg supplied",
