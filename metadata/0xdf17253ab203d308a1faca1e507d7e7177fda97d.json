    "description": "The famous Castello Sammezzano in the Tuscan mountains is one of the most impressive abandoned places ever and that's why it is considered a holy grail among Urban Explorers.\n\n\nThe original Sammezzano Castle was owned by many Florentine noble families.\nThe most famous among them was certainly the Medici family.\n\nBetween 1842 and 1890 the Marquis Ferdinando Panciatichi Ximenes d'Aragona completely changed the appearance of the 17th century Sammezzano Castle, giving it its oriental interior design.\n\nThe 365 rooms (one for each day) never resemble each other and were made by hand.\n\nSince 1990, the castle is now empty and despite several sales nothing happened, so that the municipality tries until today through auctions and the help of charitable people not to let the castle deteriorate into a complete ruin.\n\nAs much as I love decay and abandoned places, I wish that this valuable cultural heritage is brought back to life.\n\n",
