    "description": "GM to everyone trying to change their life with NFTs!\n\nMany are going to make it. Nevertheless, some seek help. \n\nFOMO, anxiety, coping with loss and other issues put a lot of pressure on our mental health.\n\nThe space has been good to me and I want to give something back. I am an IRL psychotherapist and I can help.\n\nThis is my genesis piece. Itâ€™s my first move! \n\nMy mission is to link mental health courses to the blockchain.\n\nThis piece is for all the rektgals and rektguys. Community above all. Together we will grow.",
