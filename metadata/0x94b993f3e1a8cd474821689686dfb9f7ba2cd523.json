    "description": "Pulled Rickshaw is one of the tourist attraction in Kyoto and Tokyo Japan. Is a mode of human-powered transport by which a runner draws a two-wheeled cart which seats one or two people. In the 19th century, rickshaw pulling became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia.\n\nIn recent times the use of human-powered rickshaws has been discouraged or outlawed in many countries due to concern for the welfare of rickshaw workers. The modern rickshaw men are a like tourist guide, who take their clients to some tourist spots and explain the history to them. Many of them are part-time working students and athletes who like running or exchanging cultures.\n\nAs photographer, Seeing the Pulled Rickshaw in person is like bringing you back in 1870 where this is the main mode of transportation in Japan. In addition you will be amaze how strong and energetic are the rickshaw men.\n\nGod Bless!",
