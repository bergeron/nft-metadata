    "description": "Art as a Visual Blessing \n\nThis piece is about connecting back to the core heart of the earth. Remembering the piece of us that is beating, with the earth, and realigning ourselves back to it. This piece serves as a reminder of the earth as a living, breathing being, that is connected to all of us. Listening to the earth, gives us refuge in our own hearts, as we continue to travel across the universe. Our souls, moving through , remembering on this planet this beat of the earth. May your own heart be captivated, by your soul, and the beat of the earth that beats through you. \n\nWith Love\nJessenia Ã‘auta\n\n\n\nMixture of Photography through Sony a6000,  Sketches, & Photo editing with Adobe Products.
