    "description": "Sometimes, the most important thing one can do is to stop and watch the world go by for a while. On a warm summer day, the park blossoming with life, laughs and the smell of food frying filling the air, I went for a walk. It was the perfect temperature, that kind of day where you could wear anything and still be comfortable. I meandered through the park, letting the sights and smells wash over me. The night grew ever nearer, rays of sunshine disappeared over the horizon. As I made my way back to my car, something caught my eye; A couple, sitting on a bench. The city moved endlessly around them, yet they stayed still. Their peaceful aura drew me closer, and I snapped a picture. ",
