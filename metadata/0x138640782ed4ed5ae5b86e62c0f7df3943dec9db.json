    "description": "What is fear? How it live inside us? How do we see it, where is it? What face do you have, how do you look at us? What is fear, what is the expression of fear?\n\nFear swallows us, stops us, devours us. Fear is change, knowing, habit. Fear is the purest expression of weakness. What is fear?\n\nWhat's behind the scream? What's after the adredalina? What is left in that reaction, in that fraction of a second where fear is born, in that particle of life?\n\nThis is the expression of fear. This is your own expression.",
