    "description": "The Calladita Sartoshi NFT has been created by the mfers community in support of the making of the feature film Calladita, by director Miguel Faus. A physical print of this NFT is featured in the film alongside a Crypto Punk and a Noun. The linework was one of three custom mfer pfp's used by the artist Sartoshi ( Rest On Their Pseudonym ), which were derivatives of the main collection. The Punk blue background was chosen as homage to the seminal pfp collection and as part of the intentional thematic application of color throughout the film. The mfers community will always seek to support projects at the forefront of technology, art, and culture.",
