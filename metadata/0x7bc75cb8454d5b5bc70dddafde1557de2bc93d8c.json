    "description": "In this strange dream she could fly, comprehend all the languages, and being able to transport to any place in the world.\n\nShe also dreamed of breaking free from all her inner struggles and fears. Sexual energy that had been languishing inside for so long, finally came out. She was playful, light, and carefree. But at the same time commanding and passionate. Possessing such power, she felt that she was capable of doing everything.\n\nBut then the morning came, and the dream came to an end. She woke up and she was in her bed again. In her former reality. She felt a strong contrast.\n\nBefore all this, her inner experiences had seemed so familiar and dear to her that she had indeed merged with them. But this morning everything changed. The tangles bloomed as a sign of her rebirth.",
