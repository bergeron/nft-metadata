    "description": "Up In The Air is the first piece of the Evil In Colour Series. The main goal of Evil In Colour is to express boundless creativity. Art can often be limited and put into boxes\nin order to fit someone else's narratives or to force the art to make sense following someone's rules. The aim for this series is to do the opposite. \n\nUp In The Air emanates theses ideas perfectly. It blends iconography from my previous work with vibrant colours and a fresh composition. This pieces also serves as a kind of intro theme or title page of this overall series.",
