    "description": "Met a holy priest on the way to Ukimath, Uttrakhand, North of India. Upon asking his name, he chuckled and replied - \"I left my name the day I surrendered myself to the Holy\". Although he told me his real name at the end of our conversation, but I'll still say he was \"Unnamed\". \n\nIt was about to rain heavily and he was seeking shelter under an enormous assemblage of trees near a small rustic hotel. Waiting for the thunder to halt so he could move forward to his destination, Kedarnath.\n\nHis journey - Rajasthan to Kedarnath on foot.\n\nShot on the 30th Of April 2022 near Srinagar, Uttrakhand, India.",
