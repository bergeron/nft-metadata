    "description": "Glitch Deck NFTs -- https://GlitchDeck.xyz -- is an ambitious and pioneering glitch-art NFT project spanning 8,100 unique, generated, animated playing cards by dev, author, and multi-media artist Jim Dee (aka @SwiggaJuice of GenerativeNFTs.io). The animations feature many dynamic traits (not simply moving traits, but traits that appear / move a little differently each time they appear), all themed around gaming, pop-culture, and tech. The set incorporates cohesive, themed (and highly augmented) AI imagery as well as hand-drawn, custom-designed, custom-coded traits. The combined final files for this project total 80GB (stored permanently on Arweave), placing Glitch Deck among the larger, more complex generative NFT sets in existence. As of 2023, Jim has worked on more than 30 generative NFT drops, including many sell-outs. His personal projects began in mid-2021 with NFTuxedoCats, followed by his generative LoopieLooNFT set in 2022 (a minted-out free-mint), and now Glitch Deck. For the first year of this project's existence, 40% of primary sales are being sent to a wallet to be split among 512 holders of the Deck of Degeneracy NFT drop (as of a Feb. 11, 2023 snapshot). See https://tinyurl.com/glitchNFTs for full details. Jim has randomly assigned a LoopiePartner to each GlitchDeck NFT for possible later utility. Your Loopie partner is Loopie ID 7129, which can be viewed on OpenSea at: https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xdaa3d1a810322003248e22ed739762e3e0bce7a9/7129",
