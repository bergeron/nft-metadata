    "description": "The work titled “SIGHT” talks about the people’s escape from reality to virtuality. With the appearance of new technology we can predict that it will convert us to a new way of life. If we want that it or not. \n\nFood delivery, online work and virtual friends would make people stay at home at all times. Sometimes the facet of life and online is so blurred that we can’t even tell the difference. This lifestyle brings the feeling of safety and comfort but it closes the person from the world  immersing him into deep loneliness without noticing.\n\nVirtual interactions will never compare to in person experiences and will never make us be contented with our life. In the background of this art piece you can see billboards with sayings like “Are you unhappy go to www.com” and “ VR life” which show the main message. The internet is splendor and destruction rolled into one.",
