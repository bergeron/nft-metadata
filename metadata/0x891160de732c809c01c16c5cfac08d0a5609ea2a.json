    "description": "on monday i went to big bear with a bunch of my friends to see the first snowfall of the year, but it ended up just torrentially raining for the first day, like so bad that the power went out.\n\nwe finally got our snow, and that day the crypto market imploded, my friend crashed his car, AND i got sick. \n\ni managed to get out of bed over the next two days enough to appreciate the snow outside, but was pretty fucking bedridden. so much so that i missed uploading friday's song yesterday.\n\nso i wrote this to cheat the system.",
