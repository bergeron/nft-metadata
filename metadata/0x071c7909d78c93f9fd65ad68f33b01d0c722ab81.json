    "description": "The day Parker and I wrote April (Eyes) was such a pivotal day in the direction for my new album. It really felt like a perfect reflection of how I was feeling in that moment. The second I got this one off my chest, the world of Bleach become so clear and attainable to me. I wanted this song to almost serve as a time capsule for that part of my life. The window opening and the train going over the bridge is the sound of my old Brooklyn apartment that we wrote this song in. At the end of the song, the window closes and that little moment stays there forever stuck in that period of time. ",
