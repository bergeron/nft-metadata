    "description": "My work has always been with prayer.  \nPrayer is not simply the act of making a wish.  \nIt is a vow to oneself.  \nWe pray, declare our thoughts, and take action.  \n  \nThe feelings we creators put into our works are also a form of \"prayer.  \nRemember to touch various works of art and enjoy the richness of time.  \n  \nVarious difficulties will come our way.  \nThey will appear again and again.  \nEach of us has a life that cannot be replaced.  \nEach one of life's joys, sorrows, and pleasures.  \n  \nPrayer alone may not make things better. However, I believe that without people's prayers, it would be difficult for things to truly turn around.  \n\nA thousand folded paper cranes are a symbol of peace and a harbinger of good things to come.  \nA place of prayer can make people feel positive.  \nPeople's thoughts and prayers go round and round.
