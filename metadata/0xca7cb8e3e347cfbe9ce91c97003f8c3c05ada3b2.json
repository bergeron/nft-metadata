    "description": "This is a 'latent painting', a digital artwork forged in the latent space of an artificial intelligence neural network model.\n\nTo create this model, thousands of variations of a single AI generated artwork are first created, all similar with slight mutations.  This dataset of images is then trained for hundreds of hours into the final model.\n\nThis final model, also called a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), can replicate an infinite amount of 'new' paintings based on the dataset it was trained on, and we can traverse its multi-dimensional latent space to create interpolation animation.\n\nIt's this kind of animation, moving through latent space, which offers a new way to experience the infinite facets and nuanced viewpoints of a single artwork in space and time.\n\nThe soundtrack is also generative and randomised, and even the title of the piece is from a randomized word generator.\n\nAs a generative AI artist, the less I am involved in the process, the closer I feel to truth.\n\n",
