    "description": "\"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\"\n\nTorii gates have symbolically marked the transition from the mundane to the sacred and in the midst of a crowded and chaotic day at Fushimi Inari-Taisha's Senbon Torii path, I found myself a moment of magical calm in my journey. Walking along that path, I felt an enormous weight of reflection on the distance I have come thus far, not only literally along the path but figuratively as an artist, a storyteller, and a traveller, and a huge sense of excitement looking upon the adventure that still lies ahead.",
