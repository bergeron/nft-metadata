    "description": "I saw my father helpless, hopeless\nWhen the flowers began to wilt the moment they would grow\n\n\"can you draw it?\"\nI lost my ability to hold a pencil a long time ago\n\"can you write it?\"\nBut how do I write a language I do not know\n\nThe bitterness turned to despondency\nThe pendulum oscillated between rage & hurt\nMy words broke in half long since\nso I put them in an iron box, & buried them in dirt\n\nAnd now I open the box & see only rust & ashes\nFor now all of them are lost\n__\n\n\nYou know that feeling when you want to say a common word, but can't think of it in the moment as much as you try? Now imagine that, but all the time, for pretty much all the words.\n\nAphasia is a form of brain damage to the language processing part.\n\nMy Dad had aphasia for years before he passed. He struggled to say even a single word to communicate his thoughts & would often struggle to understand what was being said to him. This artwork has been in the making in my head since before he died.\n--\n\n3200X4000px\n300 DPI",
