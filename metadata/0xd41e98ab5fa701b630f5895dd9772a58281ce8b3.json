    "description": "\nUnitail removed his tentacles one by one from the grass to which he was attached.He dragged himself towards the cool lake.At every point he passed, he smiled vaguely as he absorbed what he felt in the body of nature, and just before entering the water.His whole body was refreshed when his feathers touched the water.Before taking to feeling from inside of the huge lake with tentacles, he filled the lake with the hope of morning from his bright horn.He had taken hope from the grass, as he always did.\nThat's how Unitail spent the whole day, conveying the feelings of nature to nature.He worked with Mother Nature every day.One day he touched something with his tentacles.His soft plumage was at once startled by this new confusion of feelings.He turned his gaze to what he was touching.He tried to understand this creature, which he saw for the first time. He told man about nature and used his horn as usual. Apparently, when  a human understood him, Unitail also understood.\n2048px - 2732px",
