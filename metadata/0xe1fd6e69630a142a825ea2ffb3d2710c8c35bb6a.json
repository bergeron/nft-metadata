    "description": "Yona, as sheâ€™s known to friends, is a talented coder working at a remote resource reclamation site. Her spontaneous visions arise after she develops a mysterious sleeping sickness that has her medical team baffled.\nStunned by the awe-inspiring dreamscape of the Planet of Fire, she stands on a rocky outcrop high above the boiling lava flows. And pressing questions crowd her reeling mind. \nDo all these baffling scenes exist only in her imagination, as Doctor Nortay suggests? Might she be peering through some kind of psychic window into the future? \nAre her visions merely disturbing symptoms caused by a dangerous pathogen that's damaging her brain? Or could the dreams be doorways that lead to other realities?",
