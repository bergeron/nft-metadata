Each strand represents one of these transactions, visualising not only the ebb and flow of the network but also the possibilities that can arise from these interactions. The surrounding shape is made from a proprietary algorithm which generates forms from text. This form was created from the word \"Blockchain.\" \n\nCreated for the Tatler Asia interview with WhaleShark.",
