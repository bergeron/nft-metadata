    "description": "My work is about combining the existing elements. Fire, water, wind and earth. I translate all feelings and memories that come to me into a visual image.  \nThere are many recurring motifs in each person's life.  Some are universal.  I see water as kindness.  A red carpet as fire.  The transparent air as the halo of spirit.  The stone as all earth.  Through these elements I paint my inner story into images.  And the world is invited to interpret as well.",
