    "description": "The Future is Now is a homage to the very special place in time we find ourselves living in. As pioneers of web3 communities, we have, for the first time in my life the power to shape our own destiny. We are in a renaissance where there is no ceiling to our creativity or what can be achieved, and this deserves to be celebrated. At this unique moment, it feels like anything is possible, we no longer have the restraints attached to antiquated methods of propulsion that have held us back for so long. \n\nMy use of modern and futuristic architecture portrays the way the world is changing and adapting to keep up with our creative vision. The use of light and reflection emphasizes the bright future whilst the train shows us trapped in a small space to highlight how we are still very much at the beginning of this journey into a brave new world.  \n\nEdition: 50/50  \nTitle: The Future is Now  \nLocation: Seattle, USA  \nPhotographer: Jordan Banks  \nExposure date: 20th October 2018  \nSize: 7713 x 5142 @300dpi  \nNo image manipulation.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
