    "description": "In this parallel universe, humans have evolved to have longer limbs and are taller than humans in our universe. Their skin is a milky white, and their hair is a metallic black  colour. They possess enhanced physical abilities, with superior strength, agility, and endurance compared to humans in our universe.\nThe astronauts from this parallel universe travel through space in sleek, advanced spacecraft that utilize a unique form of energy that is not yet understood by humans in our universe. They wear form-fitting suits made of a material that is resistant to radiation and extreme temperatures.\nDespite their physical differences, the astronauts from this parallel universe share the same curiosity and thirst for exploration as their human counterparts in our universe. They are dedicated to unravelling the mysteries of the universe and discovering new worlds, just as we are.\nThis piece was created in collaboration with AI +Photoshop.\n",
