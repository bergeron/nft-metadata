    "description": "So many decisions we make in our everyday lives have a major impact on the planet.\nAccording to a World Bank report, it is estimated that, in developed countries, one person generates an average 1 kg of waste per day: cans, plastic, glass, electro-domestic equipment, etc. An environmental problem that becomes even more complicated if, as well as producing waste, we discard it irresponsibly and anywhere. \nIn fact, 80% of the trash that causes the pollution of the sea comes from the waste we throw away, not just on the coast but also inland, from where it travels down the rivers and washes up into the sea.\nWithout human intervention, nature would have no waste. Natural elements fulfil a function and are reused in one way or another for their usefulness in different stages, cyclically. A chewing gum or tin, however, cannot take part in this cycle after being abandoned in the countryside, and it remains there for years, in some cases centuries.\n3170x3170px - 30 sec",
