    "description": "The red color is at the core of the “Red Shot” series created by Stella Scala and Simeone Crispino to approach to the NFT world. The red stain spreads over the monochrome. It looks like a gunshot you did not expect but need to get used to. You see it permeating the environment as metaphor of the best and the worst of life. You do not know from where it comes, but you always know that it will never disappear. This is the meaning of human life from your visual and sensorial perspective. The mission of Vedovamazzei is to change once again their perspective: their mutating works are driven by their personal stories and by their constant search to communicate and make themselves understood by anyone, which results in a universal, clear language. This is just the beginning of a new form of art - made by Vedovamazzei.",
