    "description": "Moonboy Chronicles – Chapter 1 Pilot – Airdrop Season\n\nAs the last remaining astronaut on a mission to explore a distant ecosystem, Moonboy had always known the risks involved. But he never could have predicted the series of black swan events that would leave him stranded on a barren wasteland, completely cut off from any hope of rescue.  \nFor months, Moonboy scavenged for resources and struggled to survive in the harsh environment. His supplies dwindled as he braved sandstorms and braved the scorching heat. He was forced to rely on his wits and training to stay alive, improvising shelter and finding ways to purify the limited copium he came across.\n\nInspired by events of 22' bear market and Stanisław Lem hard science fiction wirtings.  \nMedium used: Digital painting with assistance of AI assets and photobashing.",
