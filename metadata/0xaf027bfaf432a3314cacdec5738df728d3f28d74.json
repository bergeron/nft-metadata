    "description": "The Muppet creatures were so magical and fantastical that no one could describe them properly. They were like nothing anyone had ever seen before, and their very presence was enough to fill people with wonder.The creatures lived in a hidden kingdom deep in the forest, and only those who were brave enough to venture into the woods could ever hope to find them. Those who did find the creatures were never the same again, for they had seen something truly magical and had been changed forever. Fantastical Creatures is a collaborations of nine top artists including TW: TormanJeremy, luciddreamnf1, makeitrad1, thehackettman, scor64pio, Sandytoes2211, sundog_art, illustrata_ai, KskeetP",
