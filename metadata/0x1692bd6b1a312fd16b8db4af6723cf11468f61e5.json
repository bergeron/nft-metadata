    "description": "How sweet the human soul, it has a beautiful shape, it smells good, like a soft bubble,... don't get me wrong, I don't kill them, I'm just patient, I've even been patient for years until he despairs and crumples, then the soul comes by himself, the only thing that satisfies me, a soul full of hope and passion for life, a warm and ripe soul, the game of life took everything from him and he left his owner (humans body) and came to me. He is alive, but he is only alive person, and life has no meaning for him, a person who has no soul...\n.\nResolution: 7200 Ã— 9000",
