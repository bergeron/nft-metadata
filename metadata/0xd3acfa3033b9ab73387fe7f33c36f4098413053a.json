    "description": "From the first film roll there was a surprise. One of the first images I bring in the front of light amazes me. The perfect juxtaposition of the urban landscape, the film artifacts, and the light leak resemble traditional calligraphy art. The mistake while developing the image brings this bubbly texture and dark sky. \n\nFrom this image, I decided to keep on the project. All these compositions and artifacts would be impossible to recreate and even imagine together. Chance and imagination are the best collaborators.",
