    "description": "My cheetah!\nWhen I was homeless and wandering among the galaxies, you hugged me and protected me from alien attacks, sheltered me and took care of me. So far we have hunted many planets together and established peace there, they are now living prosperously and happily.\nToday I call you a hunter.\n(The name Hunter is of English origin and means \"one who hunts.\" It derives from the Old English word Hunta and was once used as a surname for hunters.)\n\n3000X3000 px / 25x25 cm\nResolution : 300 DPI\nSize: 6.03  MB  \nSigned digital artwork by Mahshid (@NFTMahshid)\n",
