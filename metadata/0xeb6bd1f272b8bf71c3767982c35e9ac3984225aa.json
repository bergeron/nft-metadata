    "description": "Our mind is at a constant pace throughout the day, the only time itâ€™s at rest is when we are asleep. Dreams have always been a mysterious part of our lives. These brain-driven hallucinations can feel real no matter how fantastical or surreal and can generate a range of emotions from euphoria to sadness to fear.\n\nLucid dreams happen when you are able to separate dreams from reality, giving you the ultimate power to have a control over your brain. This artwork is a reminder for you to be the master of your reality as you but no one else is the creator of your own life.",
