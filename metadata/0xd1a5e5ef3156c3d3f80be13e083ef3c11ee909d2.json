    "description": "\"Journey Through A Heart\" was curated by Claire Silver to be displayed at the 'HOMAGE' exhibition at the Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi Center of the Craiova Art Museum, 1-5th June 2023.\n\nThis piece was inspired by the beautifully symbolic works of Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. I chose to explore an overarching theme of \"love\" for this piece. The animation is comprised of three themes - the first depicts birth and growth and the passage of time. The second tells a story of life and adventure. The third contemplates loss, grief and the end of life‚Äôs journey. Ultimately, all three themes work together to form a narrative of the journey of life, encapsulated in an abstract form of a heart. Which of course, symbolizes love - the source of everything good in life ü§ç\n\nInitial sculpture created in Stable Diffusion, Video in Kaiber, Music in Sounddraw, and final video was edited in Adobe Premiere.
