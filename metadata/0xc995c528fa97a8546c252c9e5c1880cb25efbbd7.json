    "description": "Usually, the idea of what the song will be about comes to me during the process of writing the music.\n\nWhile experimenting with distortion, I heard a familiar timbre from my childhood. I remembered how I spent a lot of time at my grandmother's playing with her old electronics. There were radios, TV remotes, flashlights, and so on.\nI was most interested in the radio; I didn't understand what it was, but I really liked the various buttons and the antenna. One day, I turned on the radio and heard white noise. I was surprised that it still worked. I was very happy with my discovery! Turning the knobs, I finally found a station with music. On that day, I spent a lot of time listening to music and the voices of announcers on that radio. The distortions were uniquely pleasant, simultaneously beautiful and dirty.\n\nI tried to transfer those feelings to the present, to modern sound. Here, there is that distinctive distortion, curiosity, admiration, and innocent childlike simplicity.\n\nEnjoy listening!",
