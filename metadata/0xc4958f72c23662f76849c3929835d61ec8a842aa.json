    "description": "AI death metal band, Dadabots, is the project of artists and mad scientists, CJ Carr and Zack Zukowski. In “RUG THE ROBOTS,” Dadabots finds yet another way to push the furthest edges of creativity and technology by combining what they call “human learning,” with AI-generated choral harmonies, MIDI, and drum break samples. \n\nInspired by cornerstone articles of Ethereum lore, “Ethereum is a Dark Forest” and “Sandwich Attacks vs Salmonella,” \"RUG THE BOTS” tells the story of taking revenge on malicious bots acting as ecosystem predators. The song is both haunting and manic, featuring a choral section sung by CJ, and accompanied by an AI-generated choir. Pioneering on the fringe of music’s extremes, Dadabots strikes again. \n\nRevenge, it turns out, is sweet.\n\n----\n\nThis is the ninth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
