    "description": "Wow my first NFT.\n\nHip-hop is my lifeline. It's what keeps me alive, it's been my compass in life since I can remember. \n\nMy NFT music journey is rooted in pure creativity. These raps are my attempt to recreate the feelings, sounds and moments that shaped my identity. \n\nNYC Freestyle (Demand It) was a song I had played for myself over & over until I finally convinced myself I loved it. That's right, I had to convince myself. This entire process is me finally sharing my world. \n\nOpening night at Madison Square Garden only happens once a year, and I was there with my boys making the most out of life. It's what I demand now. \n\nAustin helped me bring this together. I think this is something you can expect going forward. \n\nJust know that this piece is a real moment in time, and time is our most precious commodity. Peace. ",
