    "description": "Kaleidoscope is the second track from the Combat EP. Started in my home studio thinking about the dance-floor, early in the night while people are warming up. Something to get lost in the moment to.\n\n\"Acutek brings the tempo down for Kaleidoscope. Moody, dark, and unrelenting; behind-the-beat hats and a killer bassline keep the track grooving amidst a heavy soundscape of cavernous pads and stabs. Subtle variations in the percussion keep the listener intrigued throughout the track. Intense but irresistible nevertheless.\"\n\nIf you collect Combat Conditions, Kaleidoscope and Gravel Red you can claim a free signed copy including postage and packaging of the Combat EP 12\" vinyl. I'll also include a signed Onyx EP 12\" vinyl. I've decided to mint the extended version over the radio edit as I wanted everyone to experience the full length version as it was produced. \n\nThis is an opportunity to own the digital collectible and the physical collectible. Early support on the EP from DJ's such as Nicole Moudaber, Anja Schneider, Truncate and many others. \n\nIt's great to bring this EP to the blockchain and I hope you enjoy it. \n\nArtwork by Ross.Cracked\nMastering by Rob Small Mastering Ltd",
