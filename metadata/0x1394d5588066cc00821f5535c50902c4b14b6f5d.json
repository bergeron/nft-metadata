    "description": "It all started in a Florida sugar cane factory; just another day making Mellos. This batch was traveling by train to California. After arriving at a popular candy store the Mellos were ready to be put on the shelf. However, the clerk slipped and dropped the Mello boxes. 5500 Mellos went everywhere. To escape the store the Mellos created a short in the store decorations. The room goes dark and the Mellos are sucked into the wires behind the plug and uploaded to the internet. At first they are mad about being uploaded to the internet but then decide it is safer than being eaten. To celebrate they named the crew the MadMello. The MadMellos travel the depths of the Hollywood metaverse meeting many new celebrities and cartoon characters.....",
