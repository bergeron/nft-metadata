    "description": "Introducing \"The Cassette\" - an open edition featuring the first two singles I ever released, \"Déjame salir\" and \"Curas mi corazón <3\".\n\nAs an artist, I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and community. That's why I'm on a mission to unite young local creatives by building accessible channels of communication and collective creation. \"The Cassette\" is not just about music, it's a movement that represents the coming together of like-minded individuals who share a passion for creativity.\n\nI created this drop as a way to give back to the team of creatives who worked with me to bring this project to life. By minting \"The Cassette\", you're not only supporting the upcoming EP and fanzine, but you're also funding a new wave of young creatives who are hungry to create.\n\n\"The Cassette\" is your access key to Vince Aloé's world and creative community.\n\nGo unlock it now.",
