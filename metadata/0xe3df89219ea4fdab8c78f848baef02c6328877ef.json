    "description": "The Last Dance  \nA performance by duo Hibis & Venus\n\nThis piece is a celebration of\n\n- The closing of year 2022  \n- The welcoming of 2023  \n- Christmas  \n- A new Year  \n- My new creative direction\n\nThe piece features a duet of two Hybriders performing 'The Last Dance'. A demonstration of the breadth of my new art line embellished with subtle green & red Christmas (but not too Christmassy) spirit, but also adapted for being suited to see in the new year and all festivities in between.\n\n2022 has unquestionably been the most difficult year of my entire life and what better to end it with a celebratory dance performance created through art.\n\nFurther, I wanted to articulate the potential evolution of my new art line to show the flexibility of how it could expand and evolve from the initial Hybriders Series and still maintain recognisable consistency and a very distinct signature.\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nThank you \n\n\nHand drawn on Procreate  \n5400 x 7200 pix @150 dpi\n\n",
