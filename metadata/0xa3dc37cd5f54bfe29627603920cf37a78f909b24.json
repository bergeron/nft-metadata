    "description": "This painting is based on images generated from  the “8M, Calladita se ve más bonita” series where I have taken images from women’s marches throughout history and ran them through GAN training.\n\nIn “From Above”, we can appreciate how women are individuals that come together to gather collective strength as we march down the main avenues of our cities throughout the world every March 8th with signs and songs demanding equality and respect.\n\n\nArtwork details: Physical painting, acrylic and oil sticks on linen canvas, 64 x 64 cm, completed in 2022\n\nAvailable to first collector for a limited time.\n\n\n*All rights reserved by the artist\n",
