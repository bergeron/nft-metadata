    "description": "After a life-changing show that altered the way we connected with one another. We wandered the streets of our city in the middle of winter, holding hands and skipping down the street. Snowflakes were trickling from the sky, dancing around us. \n\nAll I could feel in that moment was pure euphoria, with my smile beaming from ear to ear. Surrounded by friends that I love as our hearts and souls connected on a deeper level.\n\nThis painting captures that moment. The feeling of connection, elation and lifelong friendships. \n\nThis is my very first NFT. If you purchase this creation, you will have the option to claim this original 24x36 acrylic painting.",
