    "description": "/ word in the artwork is translated from Russian as «world» or «peace» /\n\nPerformative installation fixed on video.\nWood, nails, fire. Physical object is made manually, 2022.\n\n— «The World, The Peace» is devoted to the absurdity of wars in the context of Russia's military actions in Ukraine.\nIt’is my personal experience of loss and collective pain. It shows broken system where wars are made for the sake of peace and human life is not valued. \n",
