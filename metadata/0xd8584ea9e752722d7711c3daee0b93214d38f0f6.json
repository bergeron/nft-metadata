    "description": "It is quite natural for a person to be afraid of something unknown, something that he cannot scientifically explain. What defies logic makes our psyche seem to be in limbo.\n\nBut this, so to speak, she does not like, which is why she strives to “close” the issue without fail, no matter what the cost. This phenomenon is called an incomplete gestalt.\n\nTherefore, some people so easily believe in the existence of ghosts that the souls of the dead return to take revenge, no matter who and for what. That the dark force wants to get the energy of living people and so on.",
