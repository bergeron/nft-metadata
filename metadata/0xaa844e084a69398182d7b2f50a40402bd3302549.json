    "description": "Before I tell you more about this picture, I want to thank you, dear viewer, for showing interest in my work.  First, I should introduce myself.  I am Paulina - a Ukrainian artist who is always looking for herself, in fact, you can see how I look by looking at my self-portrait) In my picture, everything is quite simple and unambiguous, my date of birth is August 18, 2001.  From the symbols that emerge from the date of my birth, you can see my zodiac sign (the lioness that lies on the carpet) and the year of the Chinese horoscope (the snake that wraps around the throne).  The robes in which I am presented in the picture were not selected randomly. I tried to portray the dress of the Renaissance, since it was this period of European history that I used to romanticize the most.  Well, in fact, the very atmosphere of the picture finds echoes with this era.\n\nSpecifications :\n\n3500px-4500px\nDPI - 300\ntotal strokes made 18689\n",
