    "name": "Alec Monopoly AJ1 by Relevant Customs - 1/1 Artist Proof (Size 10)",
    "description": "This AJ1 reconstruction is an excellent example of how you can use the sneaker’s existing pattern to convey a unique design concept. Relevant Customs hand crafted this special pair from high-quality, printed leather using a playful arrangement of images and colors. The concept pays homage to Alec Monopoly, a street artist from New York City, who is known for using the Parker Brothers legendary board game Monopoly character \"Mr. Monopoly\". This piece has inspired many iterations by using other art as the foundational design component.\r\n\n\r\n\nCertificate of Authenticity will be provided by Relevant Customs.\r\n\n\r\n\nMen's US Size 10.\r\n\n\r\n\nhttps://drops.clubrare.xyz/042-alec-monopoly-aj1-by-relevant-customs-1-1-artist-proof-size-10",
