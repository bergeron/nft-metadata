    "description": "The Philosopher's Stone, also known by various other names such as the Red Stone, the Fifth Element, the Sanguine Star, and the Grand Elixir in its liquid form, and many more, is a powerful transmutation amplifier. The power of the Philosopher's Stone allows one to perform feats greater than what one can do naturally\n\nThe secret to creating a Philosopher Stone is that the only way to create one is by using human souls. The more souls sacrificed the more powerful the stone will become. \n\nYou are now in possession of a Philosopher Stone, use it wisely.",
