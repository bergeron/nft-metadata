So many of the first statue was found, it must have been a treasured item by each inhabitant of this ancient civilization. Although this statue has no name that could be discovered, it is the first to be made publicly available. 222 of this statue are now available to any and all on a first come, first served basis. More statues will become available when the scientists have finished their work. Some statues are plentiful and many will be available, others only one was found.
