    "description": "Life Rebuilder is an application for brainstorming the New World in the post collapse context. We know the Earth we knew and loved is now so distant, but soon, there will be nothing between you and the New World. 100.000 beta testers will be selected by January/2100, but we have the first renders from New World Wonders, the amazing sites that are being imagined by invited artists. \n\nThis collection of images were generated by a fine-tuned model of Stable Diffusion AI, trained to the style of life simulation game The Sims 4. Dataset used was developed during two years of artistic exploration inside the game.",
