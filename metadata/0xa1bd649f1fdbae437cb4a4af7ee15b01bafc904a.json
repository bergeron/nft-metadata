    "description": "This image was originally shot as part of an editorial spread for “The Hollywood Reporter” featuring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele together as a duo. Being a team ourselves, it was exciting to bond with them about the Duo-Dynamic. Little did we know at the time, Jordan would go on to become one of the great horror film Directors of our generation.\nLocation: Eagle Rock, Ca",
