    "description": "Many times in my life I have been told that I am very sensitive or even weak for crying easily when I feel sad. \n\nBut I really wonder, does crying and expressing what we feel make us weak? \n\nI think it's the opposite, to be able to show what one feels, to allow oneself to cry in front of others, not to hide, it seems to me that it is a quality of someone strong. \n\nSo, I would like to tell all those people who always called me weak for crying, that I am not, that by letting my pain out I feel stronger.\n\n\n\n4000 x 5146\n\n150 DPI\n",
