    "description": "The genesis image in my Ethereal series.\n\nMighty Mount Ngauruhoe under the setting Milky Way, surrounded by a sea of clouds.\n\nI have been riding a massive wave of creativity while working on this image. It's an amazing feeling having the freedom to create from scratch, with no expectations and certainly no rules. One of the many empowering features of Web3 that has been so great for artists.\n\nElements of images captured over several years have been chopped up and pieced back together, with the aim of creating a final ethereal image that, until now, has only existed in my head. \n\nThe winner of this auction will be sent a physical A2 print on Hahnmuhle Cotton Rag paper, sent anywhere in the world as a thank you.
