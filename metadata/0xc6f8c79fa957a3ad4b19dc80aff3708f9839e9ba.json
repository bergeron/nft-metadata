    "description": "The real strength of a woman is in her wisdom… she is peaceful and calm, knows how to listen and slowly and confidently moves towards her goals… She is the keeper of the hearth and comfort… taking care of others is her nature… She has a mystery that no one can solve… Strong is first of all, a deep woman who draws inspiration from the depths of her soul . She is  feminine and comfortable, bright and warm, fragile and light, and this is her strength",
