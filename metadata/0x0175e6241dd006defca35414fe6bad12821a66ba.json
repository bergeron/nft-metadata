    "description": "OLA-MMA collection is a tribute to the Igbo culture, dressing, beautification using the very beautiful beads known as“OLA”. \n\nThe beads are not just for decoration or adornment, they are traditional amulets made especially for chiefs. it is believed to have special powers to protect from any curse. That is the reason why these beads were worn by chiefs and why brides and grooms choose this type of decoration for their wedding attire. They are also a sign of divinity and royalty.  Ola is a strong piece of our culture, it's significance and beauty has sustained it through modernization of attires and adornments.\nI hope that this project takes us back to the simple days before colonalisation and helps us celebrate the beauty and depth of the Igbo cultures in particular and African cultures in general.\n\n",
