    "description": "Losing someone we love is never easy,\nIt leaves a hole in our hearts that's oh so hard to fill.\nWe try to move on, but the pain lingers,\nA constant reminder of the love we once knew.\n\nWe hold on to the memories,\nOf all the times we laughed and smiled.\nWe try to find comfort in the thought,\nThat they are now free of pain and suffering.\n\nBut as the days turn into weeks,\nAnd the weeks turn into months,\nThe pain begins to fade,\nBut the love remains strong.",
