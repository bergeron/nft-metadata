    "description": "The metro behind me passes too fast. I blink my eyes, and I see different people loading in that metro from a different world, another blink changes the complete scenario with complete new people. There's this constant chaos, this noise, this constant rush which keeps on moving with me. It's difficult to say if I carry the chaos or this chaos carries me. \n\nAt the end either this chaos will swallow me or I will end this race with a win. Tired at the end of the day, I close my eyes and dream of this chaos ending, this chaos sinking and I sailing alone in peace above the deads of this chaos which shattered me for long.",
