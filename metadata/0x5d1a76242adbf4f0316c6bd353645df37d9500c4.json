They follow us everywhere like demons on our back. They are shadows that accompany us from our childhood preventing us from being the person we would like to be. We all carry them, humans have always given our fears different names, we invent gods and demons but both have something in common and that is that they always watch us, that they are always ready to judge us for our actions or thoughts, it is difficult to realize that those voices in our head, those voices that constantly judge us, are ourselves. We have the choice to live in heaven or hell. We are our own imaginary demons.",
