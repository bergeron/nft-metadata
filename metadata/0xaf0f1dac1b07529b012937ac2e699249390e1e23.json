    "description": "A portrait of a tired person who just wants to live.\n\nReality rages around him. Everything is mixed up. It all seems to make no sense. But he knows that everything makes sense in the moment. Since his life and the lives of those around him depend on this storm.\n\nExistence is in a delicate balance. And he doesn't know what to do, so he does what he can and hopes for the best.\n\nOnly fear does not leave him. Anxiety is always somewhere nearby. But there's no time for that. There is only time to live.\n\n\"Falling eyelids.\nI will finally fall asleep.\nBut will it be a sound sleep?\"",
