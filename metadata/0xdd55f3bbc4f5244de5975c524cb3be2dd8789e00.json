    "description": "This is a song I wrote about the day I met my wife! I met her at the ashram or monastery I lived in for 8 years. We met at the local grocery store, she walked upto me and gave me a candy from Moscow, where she is from. I still have the wrapper of that candy and it has been 4 and a half years since then. Itâ€™s actually the one on the cover art. ",
