    "description": "[Dana] is Dana's debut album. The album seems to comprise 9 songs, which tell a story of her journeys to establish her identity as an artist and her future hopes. According to the old blog we discovered, It's an album that makes you feel the summer with her refreshing voice and playful beats. Unfortunately, the music files are nowhere to be found but the album cover. \n",
