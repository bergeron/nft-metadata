    "description": "\"Started With\" is about being gate kept from success in the music industry. Falling victim to fake people with bad intentions, only leading to bitterness and distrust in the community.  I wouldnâ€™t say it represents my feelings as a whole, just a few bad days here and there. Iâ€™m so stoked to have found web3, where it seems like the old rules donâ€™t apply. Hope you guys enjoy this one ðŸ–¤",
