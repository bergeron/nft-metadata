    "description": "The photograph captures a breathtaking moment in time, as a steam train chugs through a landscape. The artist, aFILMativo, had been dreaming of capturing this scene for four years, and finally, his dream became a reality. The train, number 113, only moves once a year along the tracks of Minersville,PA to Schulykill Haven, PA.\n\nThe photograph is a beautiful blend of motion and stillness, as the steam train moves through the frame while the elements frozen in time. The contrast between the black train and the background creates a striking visual effect, and the plumes of steam add a sense of movement and energy to the scene. The photograph is a testament to aFILMativo's patience and determination, as well as his skill as a photographer. His ability to capture the beauty and drama of this moment, during a specific time and place, makes this photograph a true masterpiece.\n\nMinersville, Pennsylvania  \nDecember 2022",
