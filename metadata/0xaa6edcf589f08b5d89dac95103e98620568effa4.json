    "description": "Dumbo Brooklyn. September 4, 2020. It was the first summer of the pandemic and I had been taking full advantage of any opportunity for fresh air and a change of scenery. \n\nArriving at the pier, I was immediately stunned by some sort of ethereal dance rehearsal taking place. Graceful ballerinas donned in black spinning and twirling against the harsh edges of skyscrapers in the background. Their captivating movements were a welcome contrast to the current mandates and lockdowns that felt like they were suffocating the city. A breath of fresh air. An ‘it’s going to be okay’ moment. A ‘New York will survive’ dance. I knew I needed to move closer and capture this memory. One I won’t soon forget. ",
