    "description": "This work entitled ¨ Closed Days ¨ is a reflection of my imagination when I remember that place where I lived for a while and had to make my way. This image is loaded with sentimental memories, of people I met there, experiences out of the ordinary and moments that were etched in my memory.\n\nSynopsis:  \n…regretting the hard times I had to live through is not something I want, because despite everything, I learned to see the world from another perspective. As an artist, I now understand that the experiences brought to Obras have much more sentimental value, artistic value, historical value and are much easier to transmit than the same ones that are taken from forced imagination or taken lightly.",
