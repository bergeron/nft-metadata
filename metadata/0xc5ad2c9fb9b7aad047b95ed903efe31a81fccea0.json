    "description": "Guy enters through the fog of older days with a handful of cash he burns to incinerate the systems and ideologies of old. As the Fiat burns away, Guy revels at the beauty of Bitcoin as the icon of the new financial world. This is the largest financial revolution since the gold standard. _________________________________ David Bianchi's Artist Statement. _________________________________ The concept of the \"Revolution Is Being Televised\" is a response to the original poem written by Gil Scott Heron \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.\" Mainstream media does an alarmingly good job at censoring the truth from us on masse, however, social media and first-person accounts show us glimpses at the actual truth. _________________________________ The revolution is being televised and taking shape in many forms including social, technological, financial, and artistic. The Guy Fawkes mask is in the public domain and has quickly become the global symbol for revolution, and is an important symbol in crypto and counter culture. It was my duty to create high art protecting the sanctity of the mask while creating an almost superhuman persona through this series. It is my honor to have written and directed such a high-concept portrayal of today's global revolutions.",
