    "description": "The owner will receive a high resolution 2636x2160 h.264 version of the film.  \n\nJay’s Grave is a folklore story originating in the 18th century that tells of the bewitching final resting place of a young girl betrayed by her lover. The grave is a well-known landmark found on Dartmoor National Park, an enchanted place of granite tors, windswept fields and gnarled trees haunted by ghost stories.\n\nThis poetic film marks the first episode of the Folklore series that cinematically captures the magic of the old tales and legends of the moor to now preserve in unique digital form. The series encodes oral narratives told across time into the historic story of the blockchain. For the first time, history is becoming web3.\n\nThis poetic video storytelling series marks the pioneering of documentary into the NFT world, created by visual poet and filmmaker NivPoet.\n",
