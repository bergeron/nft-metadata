    "description": "Seraphina was a radiant and beautiful angel with long, flowing hair that glimmered in the light. She was the most kind-hearted and compassionate angel in all of Heaven, always willing to help others and offer words of wisdom and comfort. As one of the messengers of God, she was tasked with delivering messages of love and hope to those who needed it most, and she did so with grace and elegance. Seraphina's gentle and caring nature made her beloved by all who knew her in Heaven.\n\n- Artist Matt @ Static Motion NFT  \n- Collection: Guardians of the Ethereal Light  \n- Artwork Title: Seraphina  \n- Year Created 2022  \n- Dimension: 1920 x 3135  \n- Resolution: 300 DPI  \n- Digitally Hand Signed\n\nLicense:\n\nWith the purchase of this NFT, the artist grants the primary holder the license to sell, trade, or transfer the NFT on the blockchain.
