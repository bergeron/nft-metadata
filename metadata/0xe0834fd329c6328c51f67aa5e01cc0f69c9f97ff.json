    "description": "My collection of hand-drawn artworks delves into the intricacies of human emotion and experience. Through the subtle gestures and movements of the hand, I aim to capture a range of feelings, from joy to despair. Each drawing in this series uses the unique language of the hand to evoke a specific emotion, creating a visual language of human experience that resonates with viewers on a personal and universal level. I choose to name my pieces in numbers only, leaving it up to the viewer to connect with the emotion behind the work and interpret it in their own way.",
