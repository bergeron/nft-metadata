    "description": "Collector Badges for dope ACK holders. \n\nWith this Badge you can enter any museum in the world and draw Pepe's on famous paintings without being thrown in jail.\n\nThis Badge also protects you against divorce should your wife/spouse get tired of your tireless jpeg trading. \n\nThis Badge protects you against FOMO and Cope. \n\nThis Badge hereby grants you the right to saying phrases like \"WAGMI\" and \"GM\" without being made fun of by normies.\n\nThis Badge also gives you the right to laugh at the guy in the Lambo because he will most definitely not have a Badge.\n\nFor more details, plz ask devs for help\n\n(this work was a gift from Nessgraphics when i retired from the government, which he was kind enough to let me use as my collector badge)",
