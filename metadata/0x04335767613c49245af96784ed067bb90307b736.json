    "name": "Blue Splash Smash The Potriachy",
    "description": "Blue Smash is part of the Liquid Cacophony set of 9 NFTs which were made in one (very adrenaline!!) week flat for Nobodies first all NFT Solo Show physical exhibit at 11 Newel St Gallery in Brooklyn, NY, opening November 19, 2021. The character in this piece is a nod to Slavoj Zizek, the Slovenian Marxist deconstruction Philosopher. Nobody finds common ground in modern dilemma, and absurdist humor thus transforming into Zizek the performance artist, in this Resemblag√® NFT.",
