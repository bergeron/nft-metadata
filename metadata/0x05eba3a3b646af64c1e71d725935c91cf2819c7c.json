    "description": "Self-discovery through self-destruction. Perhaps a great attempt to achieve full self-awareness, but a sure way to hit rock bottom. Intentionally hurting yourself by trying to experience emotion, or, conversely, feeling nothing. Experiencing extreme aggression, wanting to take it out on yourself. In anger and self-loathing, one maims oneself, numbing the pain inside. Blood. Fear. And after that, he gets better for just a few moments. He wants to stop, but it's too much of a drag. It's moments like this that make him feel like he's truly living. By destroying himself over and over again, he can change something about himself and experience things he would never experience without self-harm.",
