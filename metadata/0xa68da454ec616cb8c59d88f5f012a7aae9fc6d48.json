    "description": "A collection of 252 utility-enabled, AI-generated cities. Each city unit is unique and magnificent in its own way—from modern architectural marvels to wild, uncharted places steeped in mystery. Most cities in this collection have four editions, though some only have one. Across these editions, you can experience the exact location in different years with different events taking place.\n But how did we come to know of Pholus? After all, it’s a planet far, far away from Earth.\n Pholus was discovered more than 1,000 years ago, and shortly after its discovery, a team of reporters from planet Earth began a dangerous mission to uncover the secrets of this mysterious planet and its cities.\n According to some sources, their journey alone took decades—longer than a human lifetime. But we know that eventually, a group of reporters reached this remote planet and began transmitting information back to Earth. Many mission details are classified, but reports spanning centuries have recently surfaced, providing new details on the planet and its inhabitants.\n It seems that what the team of reporters found there was deemed too sensitive to share with the general population of Earth—until now. Would you like to know what the reporters discovered?",
