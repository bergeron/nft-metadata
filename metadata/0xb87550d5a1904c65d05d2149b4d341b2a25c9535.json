    "description": "This song reflects on the intrinsic nature of humanity, existing in cyclical patterns, constantly yearning for transcendent states of mental elation.\n\nGlasstempo and I started this work during Headless Chaos camp in the spring of 2022. It was originally pitched as one of the main 45 songs in the chaos collection but was passed on. A few of the “alchemists” in chaos heard our demo and decided to make an alchemy version, remixing our original samples. You can find the alchemy version at chaos.build under the same name, “Oxytocin” featuring Conor Dalton, Frances Miller, Violetta Hyland, Deadwalker, and of course Glasstempo and I.\n\nThe version being released on sound is “Oxytocin” stripped back to its essence. It features simply a piano melody, a baseline, and layers of vocals. This is my most vulnerable song to date, I hope it strikes a chord within you. ",
