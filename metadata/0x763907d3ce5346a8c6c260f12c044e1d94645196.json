    "description": "Human life often takes place instinctively in a space with a \"room\" structure. This is probably because they want to be protected, they like to gather, and they also like to decorate. This behavior is the same in virtual space. The space you want to be protected from the rest of the world, the space to meet people, the space to decorate...\nThis idea of human instinctive space creation is expressed surrealistically. We have a surreal experience that we do not feel in the real world in digital space.\nPassing through another door will open up a new world.\n\nIn addition, this work obscures the distinction between the dichotomous real and fake of traditional art. Furthermore, they are creating and visualizing things that do not exist at all.In the era of Simulacion, where metaphysics that distinguishes between reality and virtual has disappeared, it is meaningless to draw a line and distinguish what is real and virtual, and it ends this traditional perspective and presents new possibilities ",
