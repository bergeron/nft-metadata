    "description": "\"Woke Up!\" is a part of an audiovisual collection, in collaboration with Andre Oshea, for my forthcoming EP entitled “In The Meantime”.\n\n50% of all the sales generated from \"In The Meantime\" will be placed in a wallet dedicated to supporting organizations combating recidivism rates & helping with bail assistance for non-violent crimes like The Bail Project, Maryland Alliance for Justice Reform, & Baltimore Action Legal Team. We want to be a genuine use case for Music NFTs leading to social impact.\n\nThe 3D Animations paired with 4 songs from the EP will also be highlighted in tandem with a 3-part short film to coincide the musical experience. Presale will be available on November 1st + the public mint will be on November 2nd.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sound.xyz for letting us mint using their protocol, to Tellie for hosting everything on their site, to Bello for the analytic insights, and to everyone of you that supports this drop!",
