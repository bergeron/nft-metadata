    "description": "In 1998, I worked hard to go on my first trip outside Europe. I got a job at a supermarket working full-time to save enough money to go on a 5-week itinerary to Indonesia. The beauty of Indonesia made an impact on my life and love for our planet. Years later, when I finished my photography studies, I wanted to go back to capture the scenes properly with a professional camera. But it wasnâ€™t until 2014 that this dream became a reality, and this time I had the privilege of my parents joining me. \n\nOne of the best times to visit the mighty Borobudur Temple complex is at dusk. Only minutes after the sun had set behind the mountains, the clouds cleared a bit and Mother Nature revealed the beauty of the temple and its stunning surroundings. \n\nBorobudur temple, Java, Indonesia, June 2nd 2014\n",
