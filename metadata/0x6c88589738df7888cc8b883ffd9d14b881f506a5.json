    "description": "The woman smiled to herself as she stole the cubs. It would cause the cheetah so much pain and sorrow that it would cry two permanent black lines down its cheek. She knew the legend well, and was excited to see the look of devastation on the cheetah's face.\n\nThe black tears streamed down her own face as she imagined the anguish that the cheetah was feeling. She was filled with a sadistic joy at being able to cause such pain.\n\n## Artist notes\nWhen I was creating this piece, the issues of unethical breeding/kidnapping of animals were very close to my heart. This art tells of a human, tainted by guilt and the sorrow of a mother who lost a child.\n\n## How it's created\nArtwork created using GAN AI 30%, 3D visuals 20% and digital painting 50%.\n\nAnimated in Procreate, AE & FCPX. \n\n## You will receive\nVideo in .mov format, 2160 x 3840px 30fps.  Turn on audio, loop to enjoy. \n\n## Contact\nHolder can reach me at hello@hazelong.com should they require the image version or a different video format. ",
