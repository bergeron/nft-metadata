    "description": "My friend Ryad Merhy, the boxing champion from my eponymous collection, has signed a contract for his next big challenge, a world championship final on 29 may (rescheduled) in Johannesburg, South Africa. As a photographer and avid supporter of his career, I've always found a way to fund these trip to capture his performances. Unfortunately, the budget for the trip is not available this time.\n\nI am passionate about capturing the moments behind the scenes of the fight and at the ringside. I love making this trip a reality. I found a creative way to fund my expenses by launching a sort of crowdfunding campaign with NFT.  \n After a first round with \"Fly me to the moon\" we moved forward and I reached more than 50% of the budget I need to finance the story.  \nHere is round 2, the final round. \n\"The cutman\"  offering a limited run of 50 editions at 0.015 ETH each.  \nThe goal is 0.75 ETH to cover my expenses. \nIn addition, I'm offering a 50% discount on 1/1 NFTs I sell on Fondation.\n\nThis project not only combines the world of Web3 with the real story of a photographer's journey, my journey in the blockchain and IRL, but it also offers a unique opportunity for owners to support and be a part of the journey.\n\nSo will you help me fly to the moon?",
