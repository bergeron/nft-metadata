    "description": "The Clock Tower was one of the first builds in Origin City, located in downtown Makers district just east of The Center. It's inspired by Clock Town from Majora's Mask.\n\nEver since wearables were introduced a strong culture of gift giving has persisted in Cryptovoxels. This Snow Globe is my gift to you, thank you for being a pioneer of this space.",
