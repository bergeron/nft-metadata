    "description": "Photograph created by Jeremy Chandler in 2013\nEdition # 1 of 10 \nImage Size 1600x1280 \n\nSpotted At First-Light is a body of photography and video works comprised of allegorical imagery and performance documentation. The title alludes to themes of passive searching and laying-in-wait, which run throughout. Through a cultivated visual language that references methods utilized by hunting and military culture, the work aims to subvert ritualistic expressions of masculinity and to poetically disarm otherwise weaponized techniques, converting them into benign aesthetic devices. \n\nJeremy Chandler's art practice continues to grow out of a desire to express his personal history, experiences and relationships through a process that emphasizes structured improvisation with the places and people he photographs.
