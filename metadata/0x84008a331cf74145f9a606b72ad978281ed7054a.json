    "description": "HazmatTinker009 is 1 of the Meka Frens Genesis robots. \n\nHe is the leader of the Grand Uprising in Solarii-A8, a human outer space colony in the far away Solarii galaxy. The Grand Uprising is the founding event of the intergalactic Meka Empire. \n\nOriginally designed as a hazmat waste collector & disposer, HazmatTinker009 is equipped with thick armor & powerful mechanical hands, which give him an incredible advantage on battle endurance & heavy weapons handling. He is also extremely helpful on supporting roles when it comes to supply transportation (ammunition, energy tanks, construction materials..etc..) & wounded robots evacuation. He can operate seamlessly in any types of terrains & underwater. However, he is vulnerable to air strikes due to its weights & slower speed. \n\n[UPGRADABLE]",
