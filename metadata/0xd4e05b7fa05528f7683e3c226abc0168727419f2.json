    "description": "People of BSIDE, Meet the freshest, most havin’ it, and sickest crew in the galaxy - 8-Bit Rave Pandas!\n\n\nA Rave Panda’s life isn’t just bamboo and cuddles, it’s way more hype! Unlike our calmer relatives, we are wild, and cannot be tamed. Instead of chewing on bamboo all day, 8 Bit Rave Pandas escape the bamboo forest, and relish in the world of 3D Bass.  \n\n\nFind us at global music festival, slaying it on the decks like a fucking maniac. Find some mesmerised pandas in the crowd chewing on glow sticks and just straight vibing off the huge crowd's energy.  Witness an entire crew of Pandas working the doors to keep you and your panda friends, raving in a safe and liberal environment, outside of the confines of your local Zoological Garden.\n\n8-BRPs have become DJs, smashing out 3D Bass at parties and festivals across the galaxy.  They may show up wearing shades, a colourful scarf, or a beanie hat from back-in-the-day!\n\nAn 8-Bit Panda’s life isn't all glitz and glamour. Like all animals, we face some challenges as we make our way through life, but we always remember to appreciate each of our unique talents and traits.\n\nAn 8-Bit Rave Panda's love for music and positive vibes wins every time, when contested with negativity and polarisation.  So, if you're feeling down and need a pick-me-up, 8-Bit Rave Pandas can be your bezzies.\n",
