    "description": "medium: graphite and charcoal on Bristol paper\n\nInspiration: If there was ever a drawing that carries on a lot of meaning to the artist, then this is one of them. This work describes the resilience of anyone working hard to be successful, I see a lot these persons in my nation Nigeria. The grains of sand on the man’s fist shows he has been to the lows of life. But the pointing of his finger and his valorous posture shows he will not let his lows define his ability to reach for the top. We may have gone through many challenges in the past and now, but there is a “never give up” attitude passed on in us from our forefathers that drives our ability to always, always reach for the top.\n\nThis work depicts a little of the tough street life many persons were born into or basically forced into. In Nigeria even if you wear a suit and drink coffee in the morning, you must learn how to be tough and street wise. If not you get chewed up. This reminds me of how resilient we are as people.",
