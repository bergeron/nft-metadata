    "description": "When our pride goes unchecked, it can turn us into monsters and make us vulnerable to the falsehoods we create. Only by recognizing the harm we are causing, taking responsibility for our actions, and slaying the beast within, can we get ourselves out of the grip of arrogance and reclaim our true selves. And If we don't do it ourselves then someone else will slay us and our pride with his sword.",
