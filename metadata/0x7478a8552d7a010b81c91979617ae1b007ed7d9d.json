    "description": "We are holding on.\nWe have to hang in there in front of the loved ones. In front of ourselves, to feel that we are capable and strong enough to survive in even such a terrible thing as war.\nBut what settles inside us, no matter how calm we seems, is not difficult to predict.\nWe become afraid of loud and unexpected noises. Any kind. Hear a phantom alarm. We wake up at night in our beds from the siren and, while during the day still confident that we won't leave the country before victory, we internally want to hide, shrink and teleport to where it will all finally be over.\nWe support each other. So much social contact has probably never happened to me before.\nWe talk to the guys at the front, we make plans for the future, but we avoid the fact that the future may not come because of the military losses.\nWe can't create smth sweet without military subtext.\n\nWe are proud.\nOf ourselves, of the country, of our boys.\nWe are all labeled at heart.\nThis is our insider's mark.",
