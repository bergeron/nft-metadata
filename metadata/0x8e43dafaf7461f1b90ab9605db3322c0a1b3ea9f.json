    "description": "“Function Compositions” by Ben Kovach offers a collection of 13 generative works, intertwining geometric abstraction with algorithmic exploration. Employing square grids as a primary element and a series of simple mathematical operations applied at random, the artist explores the extensive realm of possible compositions while preserving a geometric core. The series, co-curated by Ben and Unit London from an initial set of 2,000 compositions, showcases the artistic interplay between intention and emergent randomness, culminating in a selection that embraces diverse forms and complexity.",
