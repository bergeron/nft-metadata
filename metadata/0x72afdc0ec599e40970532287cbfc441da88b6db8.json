    "description": "I'm a French professional photographer living in the Westfjords of Iceland, the most remote region of the country. During the last 10 years, I've been involved in scientific studies conducted by the Nature institute of Iceland and have extensively documented the harsh life of the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and other species in Iceland.\n\n\"Breathe\" is a drone shot of a Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) taken in October 2022.\n\nIt's the first part of a new work documenting Ocean conservation in an environment subject to strong fishing and fish farming pressure. It's aimed at raising awareness on the dangers of a constantly growing human activity that leave little space for the wildlife to breathe.",
