    "description": "“Embrace Cosmos” is still photography from the short film “The Embrace of Morning” written and directed by Amyra León and painted by Alexa Meade. \n\nWe follow the protagonist on a journey of becoming as they vacillate between two realms - the idealized painted world and the reality that awaits once the facades built to shelter us from consequence have shattered both tangibly and in one’s mind.\n\nAmyra is a musician, author, director and Harlem native, seamlessly transcending genre and medium. She believes the art of listening and honest conversation are the primary tools for lasting change. Her aim is to empower communities to believe in the significance of their individual stories.\n\nAlexa Meade paints on the human body and three-dimensional spaces, creating the illusion that our reality is a two-dimensional painting. The Embrace of Morning was filmed on location at Wonderland Dreams by Alexa Meade.\n\namyraleon.com / alexameade.com / wonderlanddreams.com\n",
