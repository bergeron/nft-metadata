    "description": "\"The Tree of Life\" is a popular and universal symbol that represents multiple different things across various cultures and religions. The symbol doesn't belong to one specific culture as it has been used all over the world for centuries. Tree of Life helped to explain the divine plan of how people got here and how they should conduct themselves on Earth. Can AI help it explain even more?\n\n\n“All theory is gray, my friend. But forever green is the tree of life.”\n— Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n\n\n22.02.2022",
