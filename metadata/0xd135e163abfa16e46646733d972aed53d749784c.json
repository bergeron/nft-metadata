    "description": "Edition: 1/1\n\nThe Aetas, pronounced as “eye-tas,” are among the earliest known migrants or inhabitants of the Philippines.\n\nAetas are characterized by their skin color, height, and hair type. They mostly have dark to dark-brown skin, curly hair, and are usually below five-feet tall. Traditionally, Aetas are hunting and gathering indigenous people. They’re actually among the most skilled when it comes to jungle survival – they are even able to make use of plants as herbal medicine and possess tools and weapons. While they’re nomadic, they are able to build temporary houses made of sticks.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
