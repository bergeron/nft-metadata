    "description": "Sometimes we spend only a few moments in our surroundings. We look at a tree and percieve that it's just a simple tree with branches sticking out.\n\nBut if you look closely, what will you see?\n\nA thing or a creature is made from tiny particles.\n\nTake a closer look, and you will discover a whole new world. It might have things that don't make sense, such as a frog hanging on the moon, blood red sea. But every small beautiful elements mixing together and become a wonderful big thing. You just need to slow down and enjoy everything in your life.",
