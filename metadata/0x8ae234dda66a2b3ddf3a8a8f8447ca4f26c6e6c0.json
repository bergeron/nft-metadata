    "description": "Created with the intention of exploring the delicate and complex nature of human emotions through abstractness, the shapes capture the melancholic essence of feelings and the power they hold over us.\n\nThrough its intricately designed imagery, Wrapped Feelings invites viewers to explore the touchy and sensitive nature of our emotions. The artwork features a blend of colours and shapes that seamlessly come together to create a visually stunning representation of the inner turmoil we often experience.\n\nEmotions are sometimes too overwhelming to express in words, like sadness, nostalgia, and longing, therefore, the visual output seeks to create a safe space for these emotions to exist and be acknowledged.\n\nIts exploration of the human experience serves as a reminder that melancholy is a natural part of our journey, and it encourages us to embrace our emotions, no matter how difficult they may be, and to find beauty in the vulnerability they reveal.",
