    "description": "Punks living as elderly punks today are a vibrant and rebellious bunch. Despite their age, they continue to embody the DIY spirit and the anti-establishment values that defined the punk movement. Their lust for life is contagious as they embrace a life full of music, art, and activism. They proudly wear their leather jackets, studded bracelets, and brightly colored hair as they continue to challenge societal norms and fight for a better world. These elderly punks are a reminder that the spirit of punk rock lives on, no matter how old you are.\n\nThis collection is an imagined interpretation and celebration of how their lives might look today. \n\nAI Assisted + PS/LR ",
