    "description": "\"After the Taliban took over, I joined them. You have more security and welfare in Iran than us! Things that we've been looking for in Afghanistan for years.\", says the 40-year-old Saadullah. \n\nHerat city, Afghanistan 2022.\n\n“Legacy of Hope”\nPortrait Collection of Afghan People.\n\nAfghan's life is tied with the war. The desire for life hides under the storm of war news. After two decades since my first journey to Afghanistan and the Taliban back in power in mid-Aug 2021, this project tries to find a touch of hope through observing daily life, which narrates the story of people who, despite all proven bitterness, believe in a better future; the narrative of people who have born lived, and died in the war, sharing the legacy of resilience and hope for the next generation.\n\n5472*3648 pix\nEdition: 1/1",
