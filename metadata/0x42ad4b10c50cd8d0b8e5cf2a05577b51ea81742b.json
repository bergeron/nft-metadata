She now has a lot of money like a leprechaun, but she does not really need them with such a powerful talisman as a four-leaf clover.\n\nThe uniqueness of clover lies in each petal, which is attributed a special meaning:\nthe first petal symbolizes the hope for the fulfillment of the most cherished desires;\nthe second - means faith in a bright future;\nthe third - brings pure and strong love into a person's life;\nthe fourth petal gives a person unprecedented luck in all matters.",
