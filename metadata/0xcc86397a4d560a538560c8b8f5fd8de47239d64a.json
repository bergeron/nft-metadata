    "description": "Nestled away in Arizona is the retirement community of Sun City. It is home to 35,000 retirees & playing an active part of that community are the Sun City Poms. A cheerleading troupe whoâ€™s members range in age from 55 to 86 & were formed in 1979 as a cheerleading group for the Sun City Saints women's softball team. Training twice a week & performing over 40 times a year, from parades to NBA games, they are the antidote to many peoples perceptions of ageing.\n\nEdition of 30\n\n",
