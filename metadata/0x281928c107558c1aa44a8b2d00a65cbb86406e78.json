    "description": "Mount Waddington.\n\nThe heart of British Columbia's Coast Mountains, and the tallest mountain entirely within BC. This area does not see many visitors, and typically those that venture here are mountain climbers.\n\nBut I'm drawn to these areas, precisely because they see so few visitors and offer perspectives seen by nobody before. It is too remote to access on foot, so we flew in via helicopter and camped here for 7 days.\n\nI previously spent a ton of time flying around this area on Google Earth, getting a feel for the place. Seeing it from the air was surreal, both from the helicopter and my drone.\n\nI was extremely new to drone flying, only having bought one a week before the trip, but before I knew I had mine zipping and buzzing around the mountains. It was a ton of fun and was like playing a video game, but better!\n\nWhen we woke up on this morning, we all knew it was time to send our drones out over the glaciers. The mountains lit up and it was spectacular.",
