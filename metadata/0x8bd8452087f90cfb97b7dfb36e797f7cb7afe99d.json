    "name": "Salmon Consciousness.",
    "description": "\nSalmon is born with ready knowledge about the external environment and how to interact with it. In a collision with this environment, its internal program is instantly activated. The salmon brain contains information about the magnetic lines of force of the Earth, and this knowledge tells him the right path. When the breeding instinct awakens, salmon, swimming thousands of kilometers across the ocean and hundreds of kilometers through fresh waters, unmistakably finds the very stream where it was born and spawns there. He reads this embedded world map thanks to the neural connections of his brain.",
