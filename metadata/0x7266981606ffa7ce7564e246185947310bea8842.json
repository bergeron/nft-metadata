    "description": "Most of you know that October is Breast Cancer Awareness and Halloween. Did you know that October is Dwarfism Awareness month? Not many people know much about Dwarfism and might ask “What is Dwarfism?” or even “What’s a dwarf?” All those questions will be answered.\n\n    Now there’s over 300 types of Dwarfism, but the most common one is Achondroplasia, simply because it can happen when a gene is missing from one of the parents. Now in order to be a dwarf/have dwarfism, you’d need to have a genetic mutation. There is a word that little people, or lp’s for short, don’t like which is the “m” word or simply just midget, simply because of it being rude and offensive. \n\nIn 1957 the organization of LPA, Little People of America, was founded and since the organization was trying to find a month to have to be acknowledged, they chose October which happened to be the birth month of Billy Barty, the founder of the LPA organization.\n\nThank you all for reading.\n\nWritten by KJH (born with Dwarfism)\n",
