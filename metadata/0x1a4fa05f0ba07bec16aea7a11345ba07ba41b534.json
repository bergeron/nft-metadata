An unknown origin foreign planet with what seems to be a colossal cosmic animal, towering over the deep space explorer. Some form of energy can be seen flowing everywhere that originates from the entity. We discover yet another odd pulsing alien artefact being held up by the alien plant like structure. What is this entity & what are these artefacts? The questions & exploration continue ahead, waiting to be answered.",
