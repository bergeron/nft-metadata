    "description": "The project idea is based on the location & geographical coordinates, meaning that the semiotics of artwork would be only visible from the high-profile. The artist, by calculating the various geographical coordinates attempts to create a symbolic link between the 3 geographic locations. \n1. Origin of victims of (the area of platform 16 of  Florence central train station) \n2. Destination of victims (Mauthausen Concentration Camp in Austria) \n3. The original location of the statue of David in Signoria square of Florence. \nIn this way, 2 aspects of modern culture and history, meaning the statue of David as a symbol of civil citizen and the concentration camp as a symbol of the destructive power lied in modernity are encountered with each other. The statue, with its shocking and biting form and aesthetics attempts to challenge the issue of lack of ethical vision in contemporary life, regarding individual and social aspects and to intensify the sense of responsibility to the freedom ideal.",
