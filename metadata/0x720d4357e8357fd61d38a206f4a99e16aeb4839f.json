    "name": "WORKING ON MY-SELF",
    "description": "Two reasons behind the title. \nOne is me working on myself, exploring & building myself from scratch, starting over.\nAnd the other is, am not yet done with \"SELF\" by Rik Oostenbroek.\n\nI mostly used the curves and colours from SELF while the general outline was from the brown layer.  (I still have 4 more for 4 other layers)\n \nThe general theme is about how people are manipulated & have multiple faces on the outside & inside. Made into clowns, which turn them into a rusty old robot, dead inside. \nNew issue every day but we get distracted, while those elephants are still there, hidden from plain sight.\nIt's hard to explain those plethoras of feelings that ran into my mind. Almost all shapes and details (even pixels) you see here have meaning. Based on what I have been through, I saw & what impacted me recently. A bit of wisdom and arts from my Tamiḻ (தமிழ்) culture. The word 'முகம்' means Face. It's more like a brain dump of emotions. \n\n\nPS. See it Upside down for a different perspective.",
