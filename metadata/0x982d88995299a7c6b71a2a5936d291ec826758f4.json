    "description": "Japan Autumn Framed Perfectly. I had initially put away my camera for the day after hiking up a hill to get a shot of Mt. Fuji. On my way down, I saw this amazing framing and knew I had to take a shot! And it was good timing on my end too because seconds later, a flock of tourists came in. Had I been late, this shot would have never existed. Incredibly proud of this shot, happy I could share this with you guys! ",
