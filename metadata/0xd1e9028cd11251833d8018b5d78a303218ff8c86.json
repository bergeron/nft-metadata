    "description": "the process is always different when creating a song. sometimes I start with melodies, sometimes with lyrics. other times I have a title or concept I know I want to convey. some songs take weeks or months to finish, others are finished in days. no matter what the process is, what means the most to me is how the song makes me feel. from its inception this song felt nostalgic. \n\nI got connected to Waine over email and he sent me a loop that I immediately fell in love with. we've still never met in person, music is crazy like that. we finished the song in just a few days. I wrote it very stream of consciousness, from the heart. \n\nhope u enjoy :)\n\n",
