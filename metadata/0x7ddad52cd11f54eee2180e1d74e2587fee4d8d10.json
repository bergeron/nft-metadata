    "description": "\"Cyberbullying\" Cyberbullying or cyber harassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Here is a unique piece of 3d artwork created by me showing a deeper reality. I have created a very powerful image showing an older phone that is intimidated by the new generation of smartphones which represents life. This is the reality of today whether it is possessions or humans, the things we have define who we are, unfortunately. This is very dear to me as I was also bullied once upon a time, Once payment has been made, I will then send you a higher quality .tif format picture which can be used for printing or anything else. Thank you for taking the time to read this and taking the opportunity to buy yourself a unique art piece. This is a 1 of 1 artwork and will never be produced/sold again.\n\n10% of final sale will be donated to:\n\n https://anti-bullyingalliance.org.uk/\n",
