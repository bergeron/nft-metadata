    "description": "In celebration of Nelson Mandela Day lets not only stand up to injustice across the world but the injustice we subject ourselves to. Lets start by being courageous in identifying shortcomings inherent in us : to be brave in our beliefs, values and ideals : to persevere in order to realise our ideal selves : and to celebrate in humility and wisdom when we realise our goal..then perhaps we too would have walk the path to freedom.",
