    "description": "Tuski e is a generative collection which aims to express the idea of joyfulness with tranquility. Every individual piece is inspired by pure/raw emotions that kicks in immediately when you hear the sound of music playing somewhere near you. The musicians playing under the moon are the facilitators and the trigger point who connect you to your emotions which may also be heightened depending on whether you might be alone, with friends and family or with your lover. Lay back and try to listen to the tune of this collection and see what emotions surface!",
