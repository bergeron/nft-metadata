    "description": "ROCINHA, RJ, BRAZIL.\n\nFavela Wave is a collaboration between \"Who is This? Me\" and the prominent Surf NGO \"Vivendo um Sonho  Surf (VVS)\" which is based on Rio's largest favela. Part of the profits of this collection goes directly to the NGO which will redistribute its funding back into the kids photographed in this collection. \n\nVVS is founded by a prominent surfer who started out by refurbishing a surfboard found in the trash. Now, 15 years later and featured in many documentaries around the world, Carlos (aka Mistesurf) helps kids in endangering situations to overcome their realities through sport. The dichotomy between the concrete waves and the liquid ones which are a glimmer of hope in the community is what inspired us from \"Who is This? Me\" to take on this project to help spread the word regarding this project. \n\n70 kids are currently being helped by the NGO with surfing classes, alphabetization, English lessons and 2 meals a day. Help us fund their dreams.\n\nMore drops soon!\n\n",
