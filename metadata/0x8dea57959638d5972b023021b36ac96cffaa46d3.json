    "description": " Azrael holds a rather benevolent role as God's angel of death; he acts as a psychopomp, responsible for transporting the souls of the deceased after their death. As humans, we are always interested of the Death as a traumatic transition and since  i was a child, this Archangel got my attention. IÂ´m grateful for his intervention and knowledge in my meditations and dreams.",
