    "description": " The purpose of this performance was to work with keywords such as Ethereum, environment, and New York. It shows the hope that Ethereum's impact on the environment will change in a good direction, and the environment is also revived as a result. I spent a few days in New York and experienced Central Park's impact on New York's environment. And I sketched it every day. The work created in this way is the performance work of the Ethereum New York Opening Ceremony at 7 pm on June 24, 2022. This is a video of a work drawn live for 15 minutes.\n The work begins with a dark background. The forest in New York's Central Park is painted in dark tones. Then, after drawing the Ethereum logo in black, change it to white. It is a part that symbolizes the change of Ethereum. And put the Ethereum logo in the Central Park lake, which seems to symbolize the heart. As a result, the lake finds life. The color of the water turns blue, and the forest finds itself in green.\n\nVideo: 2048Ã—1152px | 30fps | mp4 ",
