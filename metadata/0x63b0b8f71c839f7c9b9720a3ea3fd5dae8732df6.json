To escape the store the Mellos created a short in the store decorations. The room goes dark and the Mellos are sucked into the wires behind the plug and uploaded to the internet. At first they are mad about being uploaded to the internet but then decide it is safer than being eaten. To celebrate they named the crew the MelloFello. The MelloFellos travel the depths of the Hollywood metaverse meeting many new celebrities and cartoon characters.....",
