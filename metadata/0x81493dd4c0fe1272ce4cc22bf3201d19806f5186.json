    "description": "This song was conceived initially as a freestyle on January 25th, 2022. \n\nDuring the initial tracking session, I was trying to figure out what my next move was. I was damn near broke, applying for jobs like a mad man, and making music to cope through it all. \n\nMoving to LA was a real possibility at this point in my life, and was top of mind as I free-styled to some beats I had on hand. Some of the takes on the final version of this song are from that first session because I loved how they came out so much that I didn't dare recreate them. Because of this, I ended up recording the whole thing on my handheld Audix OM5 mic instead of in the booth. However, I did go back and polish up the lyrics. \n\nThe message behind the song is more about weathering the storm of life - recognizing that staying present in the moment, despite what it brings, good or bad, is something to be grateful for.",
