    "description": "The sea it's turbulent and dark grey like her soul. The foam it's just a soft distraction from how chaotic and lost she feels in her empty heaven.\n\nThe struggle became a huge monster, which she decide to hold hands and face the world. Embracing the monster birthed from her own abyss to find a new dimension in her gloomy world. \n\nBehind the veil there's an endless violent battle field between the ego and the heart.\n\nBut who's winning ? the ego or the heart ?",
