    "description": " The creating of this project began after I saw Dali's work - \"The Face of War\"\n\nAny military events are a cake of different ingredients/layers.\nIn all areas, whether it be a type of weapon, types of troops or political goals. A dish that cannot be made from one ingredient.\n\nCANDLES - a holiday and joy from victory and goals. A celebration that is built on the layers of cake and the countless sacrifices that this cake gives us. \n(we are not talking about the necessity or futility of war, the essence of the work is in the fact of its consequences and its components)\n\nTHE SILHOUETTE OF A PERSON AND HANDS - various leaders of nations, empires, states, groups are holding out this cake to us, under festive candles, the warmth of which envelops us and intoxicates us, making us forget about what they stand on.\n\n\nBE PROUD OF YOUR VICTORIES, BUT DON'T FORGET WHAT IT STANDS ON.\n\n\nSize - 7000â•³5000",
