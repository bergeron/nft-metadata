    "description": "Dada could feel Bolt's vex at the reins. The heat waves were visible in the air. \" The Copper Sector is on.!\" Dada sighed.\n \nFrom the chilly snow city, to the eternal springs of the Nova city, to the sun-drenched Copper Sector, it has been a tumult of progress for the trio.\n\nThe lunar domes crafted out of the meteor rocks were visible from afar. \" They are inspired from Saturn's rings, made of stardust and solar cubes\", Dada explained to Hira. Her eyes lit up like the starry night skies. Dada had never seen Hira so hyped up. She wanted to see the domes and so he took her there.\n\nUnderneath the shades of meteor pillars and patches of green, they stopped for a while. As Bolt rested, Dada and Hira enjoyed the site as Dada tried hard to answer all of Hira's doubts.\n\nContent Creative: Mahesh Krishnan (Bohomonk)\n\nArtwork specs:\n5760px x 3240px",
