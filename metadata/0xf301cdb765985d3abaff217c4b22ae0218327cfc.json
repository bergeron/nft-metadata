A paranoid person thinks, without any basis in reality, that everybody is out to get them. A pronoid person is someone who thinks, without any basis in reality, that everybody likes them. \nA belief that I’ve carried since my younger days. A way of thinking that breeds hope and fuels positivity. Maybe it is also a way of protecting ones self esteem by convincing ourselves that others have our back and best interest. If so, why not. It’s a vibe.\n\noriginal music instrumental excerpt from mixtape track written and produced by Vance Johnson and Nicholas Swallow in Honolulu, HI 2014\n\nGenesis .eth mint dedicated to childhood bff Vance Johnson aka Mr. Heartbeat (HB)\n\nMuch Aloha \n\n4K\n2160x2540\n48.1 MB",
