    "description": "\"Subjects 224567 and 226453 were last spotted heading westbound near the giant bear on Andromeda Boulevard. Air Patrol was dispatched to the area at 17:00, but so far all attempts to locate the pair have proven unsuccessful.  \n\nAt this time we believe 224567 and 226453 are trying to flee the Imaginarium with the aid of other members of the Pack O'Derms Motorcycle Club.  IPD Officers are currently conducting sweeps of all known Club hangouts in the Pituitary District as well as all nearby spaceports.\n\nOff the record- Five million sapiens in the Imaginarium and the Arc Light winds up in the hands of some biker skid from the MechaCombat pits and his daughter? \n\nWhat an absolute mess.  If they manage to get off-world we might be in serious trouble. You have my word that heads will roll for this, including 224567's. After we catch them I think I'll make him watch as I rip the Light from the girl.\"\n\n- Report by F. Thompkins, Director of Tech Security, General Science Corp.",
