    "description": "Conforming to a standard seems imperative today. Almost everyone has a role model to follow, a person to be inspired by, a prototype physique, and a face type that would be ideal for success.\n\nDoes conforming to a standard really make it special? To be out of your mind, to be considered normal, not beautiful, is it really that bad?\n\nIn search of Beauty is simply the society trying to standardize what cannot be standardized. \n\nYou are beautiful in any way you are.",
