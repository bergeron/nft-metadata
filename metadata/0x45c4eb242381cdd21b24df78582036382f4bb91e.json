    "description": "Located in the Yonghe district, the Baofu Temple is \"hidden\" in a residential neighborhood, and the entrance can be spotted between two apartment buildings.  When viewed from the street, you can see the magnificent architecture of the temple from a distance.  On a cold winter day, I waited patiently for a stranger to walk past with an umbrella for scale.",
