    "description": "Ausbot was built for one purpose, to ride a rocket to the moon. The team at BLOCKSTARS had faith in him and his abilities, and so they helped him on his journey. They provided him with the best possible rocket and all the necessary supplies, and they cheered him on as he blasted off into the sky. Ausbot was nervous but excited as he began his journey. He knew that he was going to be the first robot to make it to the moon, and he was determined to succeed. The trip was long and difficult, but Ausbot persevered. With the help of the team at BLOCKSTARS, he made it to the moon safe and sound. Now, Ausbot is a hero. He is celebrated by everyone at BLOCKSTARS, and his story is known all around the world. He is a symbol of hope and determination, and he will always be remembered as the first robot to ride a rocket to the moon.",
