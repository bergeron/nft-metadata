    "description": "Now I know that hell on earth exists.\nAnd this is absolutely true. He is in Ukraine!\nHave you ever fallen asleep with the thought that you would never wake up? What about every night? Did you think about death every minute?\nI no longer think about it. The fear of death is gone.\nBut most of all I worry about the children.\n\nChildren are the most important thing in our life. I think many will agree with me. Especially those who already have children.\n\nMy biggest fear is for my daughter. For all the little children of Ukraine. After all, they do not even know the words - \"politics, war and genocide.\" But some of them already know what death is.",
