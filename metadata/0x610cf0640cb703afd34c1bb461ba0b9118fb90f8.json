    "description": "The BLACK Badges are one-of-one commemorative pieces around MATTE Black. Benjamin Gordon cites BLACK coming back to life as an incredible moment in time-- the badges being a visual representation of just that. Where BLACK exists in the shadows and draws out that side of an attendee's personality, the BLACK Badges intend to do the same.\n\nThe Artist uses machine learning to combine large data sets of his own personal life, weather patterns, satellite imagery and ominous sounds to represent this and drive rarity in the collection. Different colors appear more often, certain textures shine through, and each and every result is unique. Gordonâ€™s work speaks to the whole universe being based on duality, computer systems relying on zeroes and ones, and all things existing in a state of yin and yang. \n\nPurchase your own unique machine generated exploration of darkness and forever hold a token that symbolizes the beauty and importance of the shadow and its inherent significance to the fabric of the universe.",
