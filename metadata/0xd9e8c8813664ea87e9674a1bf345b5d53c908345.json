Opened the planner app (photo pills) and - saw \"The Eye'' (and it looked at me). Now all I needed was to wait 6 months, to perfectly position Milky Way \n \nShooting itself was very exciting, I knew what to expect. The only hope was not to be spoiled by clouds. For my fortune, the sky started to be cloudy, exactly after I did the required shoot \nImage is taken at Timna Valley.\n",
