    "description": "“Time is a luxury”: The artwork talks about the urgency the human kind is facing with growing global problems. In urgency and haste the significance of time changes, and it becomes a valued item we wish we had more of. Yet, it is one of the only things we cannot buy with money.\n\nJani Leinonen is an artist who lives and works in Helsinki. Leinonen became well-known for his provocative, yet playful works criticising capitalism and our self-centred consumerist society of today. In his practice, the artist often pinpoints timely issues and dares the viewer to think outside of one’s comfort zone by taking the most saturated aspects of our modern world and re-presenting them in constantly thought-provoking ways. His works have been exhibited widely in the most prestigious galleries and private collections all around the world.",
