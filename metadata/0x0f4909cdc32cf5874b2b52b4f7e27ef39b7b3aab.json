    "description": "The sun descends like a wrecked sailboat taking its last breath. As the creeping cold strips the rock of its collected warmth from the days exposure, it enters my bones, chilling everything in and around me. Turning away from the coastline, I begin my ascent up Jacobs Ladder to the cliff edge above the beach. Laughter from the nearby pub rises with me, beckoning me to join the coziness of the wood-burning stove bellowing within.",
