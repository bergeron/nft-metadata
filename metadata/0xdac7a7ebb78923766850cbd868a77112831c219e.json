    "description": "**The Fadogizmo Collection**\n\nThe Fadogizmo Collection is a body of work inspired by the Warner Bros, 1984 film \"Gremlins\".  Using his iconic character Fado, the artist reinterprets the main character from the film \"Gizmo\" and retells the story of this classic blockbuster picture. Each one of the pieces from the collection presents a distinctive object that references an important moment in the narrative of the film and also staple elements of American pop culture.\n\nNote on artist:\nGabriel \"GG\" Gimenez is a Miami based multidisciplinary artist who's works range from paintings, to large scale murals, documentary productions, interactive media installations and digital art. His work is often inspired by the conscious understanding of one's own vulnerabilities and flaws as a positive driving force. His pieces often allude to pop culture and personal experiences in a unique and vivid manner through vibrant color schemes and stylistic details. Self-taught, GG has been recognized and praised for his works at an international scale, varying from art fairs, gallery exhibitions, private commissions, Emmy award winning production and brands collaborations.",
