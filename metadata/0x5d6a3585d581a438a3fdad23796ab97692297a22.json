    "description": "The perseverance. From lost to found, from dark to light, and from broken to healed. In 2013 I photographed this shipwreck, and two years later, I created this image from those photographs.\n\nThis artwork is part of my photography legacy and one of the pinnacles that got me noticed around the World. It's the most recognizable work I have ever created. \n\nThis shipwreck was half-sunken and barely on the water's surface. A new owner has fixed the boat, and it is roaming the seas again, making this image never to be created again.\n\nThis piece is also on the cover of my photography book Landscapes with Soul. The collector will receive a copy of the signed hardcover book and a fine art print.\n\nLocation: Porvoo, Finland  \nSize: 7050 x 6350 px  \nCapture date: August 2013  \nCreation date: April 2015",
