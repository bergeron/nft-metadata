    "description": "Set in the picturesque landscape of Guilin, I set out to capture these environmental portraits of the iconic cormorant fishermen. Using only the lamp as the main light source, I aimed to capture the scene in a mystical and dramatic mood. This also allowed me to set the viewers eye to focus on the person and highlight the charm of the scene. Cool environmental color tones gave the optimal contrast to the warm light of the lamp. The majestic mountain peaks and the smooth reflections on the water provided the perfect backdrop and feel to the composition.",
