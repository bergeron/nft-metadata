    "description": "Rarely do I directly address a piece in its description. But today I will because I khan. \n \nYou see this piece is different. Artists have the ability to time travel when they look at their work. They can remember exactly what they were feeling at the time, how hard they worked on it, etc. \n \nI feel this with all of my pieces. But when I look back at this piece I feel an emotion I can’t find the name for. So I'll explain it to you. \n \nIt felt fleeting. It felt freeing. It wasn’t about making a masterpiece or getting every detail right, it was just about creating. This is a simplicity that I wish existed more in my process. This piece will always bring me back to the time when I practiced that simplicity, and it brought back a feeling of peace I had forgotten. \n \nI love this piece. I love it because I can go back and fix so many details but I never will. A great artist knows when their work is done, and this piece is complete.",
