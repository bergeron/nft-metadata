    "description": "Scarletta The Twisted is a photo realistic artwork created using AI.\nThis artwork challenges conventional beauty standards and gender roles simultaneously. By combining the traditionally feminine qualities of beauty and attractiveness with the masculine or scary qualities of a clown, the photo questions the societal expectations placed on women to conform to a narrow definition of beauty and likability. This piece suggests that women can and should be free to express themselves in unconventional ways.\n\nThe image also represents the idea that beauty can be deceptive or that there is an underlying darkness beneath an appealing exterior.\nScarletta The Twisted  is intended to provoke a sense of unease or uncertainty in the viewer, challenging their preconceived notions of what is attractive or appealing.\n\nAI Generator: Midjourney \nEdition: 1/1 \nYear: 2023 \nArtist: Els Casaert\nDimensions: 6050 x 6050",
