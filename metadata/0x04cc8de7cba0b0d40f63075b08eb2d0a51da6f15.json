Holi is known as the festival of colors, where people smear each other with brightly colored powders and water. \n\nThe festival celebrates the arrival of spring and the victory of good over evil. It is a time to forget past grudges and embrace each other with love and forgiveness.\n\n__________________________  \nArtist: Soumya Geetha  \nCollection: Jashn  \nTitle: Euphoria  \nMedium: Digital Art\n\nLicense :  \nPrimary NFT holder is free to use in display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
