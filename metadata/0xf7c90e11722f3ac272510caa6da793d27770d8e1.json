    "description": "My first key was created in collaboration with Arcane Prism and generative sculptor Bleicherleo in June 2020. \n\nAfter purchasing the key, you get the opportunity to order a personal symbol, which can be realized on a canvas or on the body of the owner in the form of a tattoo (the artist has been making tattoos without a tattoo machine for over 10 years and is a professional).\n\nThe key holder receives free admission to all events in which the artist and the Arcane Prism audio-visual collective participate.\n\nEach key also has its own audio code written by the Arcane Prism creative team. The key gives you the opportunity to get the copyright to the music that will be revealed after the purchase of the key (Dance Electronic Music).\n",
