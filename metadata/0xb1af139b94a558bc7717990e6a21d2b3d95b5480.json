    "description": "Every creature in nature is \"as it should be,\" and it is only man who, It is never what it should be. Whatever man takes from the soul, and whatever distances himself from what \"is,\" It also goes beyond what \"should be\", and that is, whoever is higher, It is more frightening than the horror of vulgarity, And more unpleasant than being, and that is the difference between man and animal.",
