    "description": "The word metanoia has a Greek origin and means a change of direction, spiritual or intellectual conversion. \n\nThis restlessness of the soul is like an insistent siren that leads us to reflect on the consequences of our actions and on the path we really want to follow.\n\nMetanoia becomes necessary when we realize that our journey has lost its enthusiasm, and to be able to change course we need to have a change of thoughts, feelings, and actions.",
