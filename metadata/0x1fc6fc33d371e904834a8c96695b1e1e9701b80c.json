    "description": "This Pink Bunny Express Bus is a gift for Pink Bunny and Friends NFT holders. It's a way for you to compose a scene with your Pink Bunny and Friends SVG drawings and then use a pen plotter to draw it. The double decker bus drawing references a video that was made starring Magic Monkey Bob explaining London Double Decker buses. \n\nTo plot this, import the pinkbunnyexpress.svg file into Inkscape. Then import your Pink Bunny and Friends SVG files and drag them into the windows of the bus. \n\nFor good measure and to ensure everything is plottable, under the Edit tab click on Select All in All Layers and then under the Path tab select Object to Path. \n\nNow you are ready to start up your pen plotter and draw your characters on the Pink Bunny Express Bus!",
