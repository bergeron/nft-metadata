Of these 118 elements, only six are among the components that make up living things. Carbon is by far the most important of these six elements.\n\nMore and more people around the world are living in cities, making them the most important living spaces of the future. Cities are more than places - they are hypercomplex, dynamic systems, important problem solvers of global challenges, creative centers of pluralistic society, hubs of the globalized economy, and increasingly powerful political actors as well.",
