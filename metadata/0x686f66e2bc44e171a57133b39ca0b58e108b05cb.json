    "description": "statement\r\n \"Passing\" is perhaps the most important word in describing my works, passing through the nature that is rooted in the years\r\n It takes years to face it, but what makes me happy to see nature is more than beauty\r\n And the objectivity that governs it should be passing through the interweaving and blending of colors and the abstraction in between.\r\n These are the colors that appear on my canvas.\r\n Maybe the multitude of available colors is a bridge between my relationship with the surrounding nature.\r\n For me, painting from nature begins with the same encounter, but in the continuation of these events\r\n The unpredictability that drives my work is a way for me to deal with it\r\n It is obtained with existing objects and this process of painting along with the happenings during work\r\n is what makes me happy, not clarifying the issue at the very beginning of the work.",
