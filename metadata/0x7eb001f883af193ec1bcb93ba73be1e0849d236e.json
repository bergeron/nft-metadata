    "description": "It happend, the long-awaited RNDR listing on Coinbase. This artwork was made when the listing was still a rumour. For a while the most asked question was \"wen Coinbase?!\". This artwork is born out of passion for 3d and as a hommage to this great project and community.\n\nRNDR is my favorite project in the metaverse. In the growing 3d world, render time is the biggest bottleneck for 3d artists. With Render Token you can reduce these render times. The utility is huge and RNDR will have a great impact in the metaverse.",
