    "description": "This image is part of Koekkoek's first photo book \"The World We Live In\" - published by Kehrer Verlag. It was also exhibited worldwide at several art exhibitions. \"The World We Live In\" was listed as one of the best photo books by ilovethatphoto.net, and was voted photo book of the year at PDN Photo Annual 2014. \n\n\"Fascinated with microcosms, Koekkoek works with the idea of being able to move through several worlds in a day. While each community may have their own way of existence, that existence always shares components in a much larger picture. Koekkoek has a style that can only be described as documentary with a fathomless soul, and his treatment of light and seemingly effortless communication of different realities, is something you must hold in your hands to understand.\" — Aint Bad Intependend Publisher of Contemporary Art",
