    "description": "Faces of Rwanda  1 of 1. \n\nIn my experience, the best way to get to know the local people and have a better understanding of the place Iâ€™m visiting is to spend time at the local market, watching and connecting with the people there.\n\nIn 2016, I had the chance to travel to Rwanda twice to photograph mountain gorillas. During my time off, I walked to the nearest market to photograph the people. I used my polaroid camera to connect with the people by offering them a photo of themselves. Most of them had never gotten their picture taken in their entire life, which allowed me to capture their expression in its purest form. \n\nThis collection showcases some of my favorite photos from my time at the local market in Ruhengeri, Rwanda.",
