    "description": "Self-portrait. Oil on canvas, size: A3. Time: two weeks.\n\nIt's a surprisingly quiet morning. \n\nYou are standing knee-deep in snow in some clearing. In your eyes everything is as foggy as it is outside. You do not understand how you got here. You turn around slowly, your gut feeling danger, like a true predator. What drives you? Hunger? Bloodlust? Or maybe... Fear? \n\nAs these thoughts flashed through your mind, you heard a sound behind you. You turned around, and all you saw was the glint of a razor-sharp blade against your throat. That moment was Eternity. \n\nIt was a surprisingly sunny evening.\n\nYour body lay in some clearing, illuminated by the last rays of the sun. The last for today, and the last for you. Now you will finally rest. \n\nYou have realized that there is no point in war. You felt cheated. You have realized that with your hands it has taken the lives of innocents, and in the end it has taken you too. Too bad it's too late. Everyone understands - only it's always too late.",
