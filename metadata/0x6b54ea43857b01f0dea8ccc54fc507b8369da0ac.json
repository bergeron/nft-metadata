    "description": "Woman with a cigar.\n\nA painting inspired by a visit to Cuba.\n\n I saw this lady of the bar, she was free, relaxed and smoking a cigar. The whole world seemed to stop for a moment to admire her.... \n\nI enjoy every detail of my paintings. Each element born accidentally or deliberately fervently loved by me. This is the element I gave birth to in the morning and I was so happy about it, it brought almost the whole picture together, it became an eye-catcher \n\n7589x5047 Only NFT , \nUnfortunately Physical Art no longer exists \n\n\n",
