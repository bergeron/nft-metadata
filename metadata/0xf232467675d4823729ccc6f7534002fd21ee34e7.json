    "description": "The ZOLLHOF NFT is a community-driven web3 experiment. ZOLLHOF (zollhof.com) is one of the biggest startup incubators in Germany with a thriving community of entrepreneurs, investors, corporates und talents. The NFT collection wants to resemble the origins of the building where ZOLLHOF is headquartered: the home of the first German patent. The patent No. 1 (filed in 1877) was issued for the invention of a process to manufacture ultramarine color by the entrepreneur Johann Zeltner from Nuremberg. At ZOLLHOF mostly blue ultramarine color was produced hence the blue NFTs.",
