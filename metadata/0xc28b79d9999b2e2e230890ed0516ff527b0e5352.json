    "description": "The “Lambo Graveyard” is a series of black and white drawings which were auctioned on OpenSea in October 2022. Contained within the art are numerous characters and themes which I aim to explore in the near future. Very often artists and designers show their work “on product” - this gives people an idea of how the art can be used and, more importantly, the value of it. To exhibit your art on a REMX collection is a great way to demonstrate its versatility and potential.",
