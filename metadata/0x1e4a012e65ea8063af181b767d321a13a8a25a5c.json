    "description": "I’ve always been drawn to movement, and the incredible strength and contortion the human body is capable of, so athletes and dancers are some of my favorite subjects.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic got underway, and a lot of normal in-person interactions became unsafe, one of the most important parts of photographing bodies in motion — being there, where the action is — was suddenly untenable.\n\nBut this kind of restriction can also lead to new ideas; I started photographing dancers across the U.S. using FaceTime, and found that editing the images into abstract and geometric forms was an effective way to communicate the distance I felt.\n\nThe resulting series was very much a product of the pandemic, both in terms of its production and ideation, but I was also surprised at how seamlessly it extended from work I’d been doing for years, in ways that were both unexpected and creatively freeing.",
