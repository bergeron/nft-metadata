    "description": "Once an Empress of the High Nocturn Castle, Esma, Lordess of Praise & Innocence, was banished from the Throne-lands, pushed out by the very people she loved most and those she thought had loved her. \n\nEsma now leads a small band of Reapers, made up of some loyalties that swore by her side for all time. She reaps the southern lands, feeding on souls of the unnamed & lost, building her power for a time to return to her old kingdom in the Throne-lands. Her endless battle continues as Esma seeks revenge for the love that was so brutally ripped from her eternal heart and she'll reap as many souls as it takes to become Empress again.",
