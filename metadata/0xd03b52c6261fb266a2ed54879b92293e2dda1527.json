Instead of renting a car to go to this destination, they preferred the long way. They took a train, ate in a convenience store, rented a bike, and enjoyed the view. Finally, upon reaching the place, Kevin saw two birds on the right side of the torii which made him smile, thus came up with the haiku for this image.",
