    "description": "\"The power of your dreams can take you to unknown worlds of abundance. You have the power to envision a life of magnificence and greatness\"  \n\nFrom a moment of magic in the beautiful mountains of New Zealand, this moment in itself invigorated a spark in me that I can make my dreams a reality. The moon reminds me of the beauty of life, sometimes we must go through phases of hardships to be whole again just like the moon.\n\nOpen edition  \n\nartist: Joanne Hollings",
