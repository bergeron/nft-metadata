    "description": "Libra, Aquarius, and Gemini are the zodiac signs associated with the element of air. People born under these signs are often known for their intelligence, communication skills, and ability to adapt to change.\n\nSymbolically, air represents the power of the mind and the ability to think and communicate. It is also associated with movement and change, as it is constantly in motion. Air is often seen as a symbol of new beginnings and the power of inspiration.  \n",
