    "description": "\nWe have been enslaved by “seeking validation” we always want to seek validation in everything we do, nobody wants to embrace their mistakes & weakness or even explore what they feel they can do, rather we think, “what will people say about this” as if such validations has any positive impact in our life, hence the reason why so many ppl bring even private matters to social media. Anyone who is so scared of criticism is scared to grow. The criticism you should face is the one coming from your inner self, the criticisms coming from other ppl is only but an opinion Tell yourself the truth and when others say it to you, it wouldn’t even hurt as much, but if you allow others tell you the truth first, you will end up fighting the outward demons Fight your inner demons!\n\n\n",
