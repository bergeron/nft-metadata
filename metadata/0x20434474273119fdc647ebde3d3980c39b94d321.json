    "description": "Vivid Fever Dreams is an up-and-coming alternative electronic music producer who has been making waves in the music scene with his unique sound and style. His latest track, \"Gone Away,\" is a poignant and emotional piece that deals with the pain of separation from someone you love. With its haunting melodies and intricate beats, the track captures the raw emotions that come with heartbreak, making it a relatable and deeply moving piece for listeners.\n\nOne of the standout features of \"Gone Away\" is the way it was made. Vivid Fever Dreams utilized samples from the MSFT Kit pack to create the track's distinctive sound. The MSFT Kit pack is a collection of audio samples created by MSFT and one of the first NFT music sample packs, designed to be used by music producers and artists. By using these samples, Vivid Fever Dreams was able to create a unique and innovative sound that sets \"Gone Away\" apart from other electronic music tracks. Overall, \"Gone Away\" is a testament to Vivid Fever Dreams' talent and ability to create powerful and meaningful music that resonates with listeners on a deep level.\n\nThe song was written and produced by Vivid Fever Dreams and mixed/mastered by Kyle Billings.\n\nThe golden egg winner will receive the vox stems.\n",
