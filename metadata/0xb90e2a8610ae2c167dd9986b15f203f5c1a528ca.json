    "description": "*For my incredible collectors*\n\nThe relationship between a person and the full moon - a beacon of hope that has long been associated with mystery and magic, a source of solace and a reminder of the human experience of feeling isolated and alone. We often find comfort in the night sky and the moon. It can represent comfort and guidance in our solitude, sitting high above the world looking down on us, reminding us that we are not alone in our feelings of loneliness and that there is always something out there that is larger and more powerful than our individual struggles. A force of nature that toes the line between comfort and melancholy, the allure of this energy can evoke feelings of wonder and awe, as well as a sense of connection to something greater and timeless. Something that can make us feel so small can give us so much power, and allow us to rise above the trivial and insignificant troubles that seem to haunt us. It can bring us back down to earth, grounding us. When in times of doubt, I follow the guiding light of the moon. ",
