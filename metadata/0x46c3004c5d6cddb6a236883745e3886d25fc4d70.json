    "description": "The search for freedom is something that I've been doing since I was a kid. Being a free spirit, living more in the fantasy world of my imagination than in the real world, where I feel FREE from all social, cultural, economic and political restrictions and problems. Safe from everyone, where I can really grow and expand...Freedom from expectations, where the time just slow down and pause.  \nI can reach that Freedom within the creative Flow for a while, but I'm still searching for it in the real world. Is that even possible ?",
