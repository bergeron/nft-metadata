    "description": "where is the boundary between reality and imagination when we are not sure what reality is? \nhow to know who we are while we are everything and everyone? \nhow to remember that we live many lives ?\nwhen the gates of perception open for us and cleave the layers of reality and imagination which piled on top of each other, we realize that the border between reality and imagination is nothing more than an illusion. we no longer see the world as we have seen it before and everything collapses at once. \neverything is neither real nor imaginary anymore. from now on, we will step into many alternate worlds by opening the gates of perception.\n\n2000*2000 px\nduration: 00:35\nratio: 1:1\n\nthe final output is animated from my original acrylic painting.\n",
