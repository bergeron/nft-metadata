    "description": "This is the final song from CACOPHONY, a new project from Reo Cragun and myself. CACOPHONY is a beautiful explosion. Deafeningly loud and chaotic and intimate at the same time. \n\nI grew up listening to a lot of underground hip hop. Lurking on the D12World forum I discovered Rhymesayers, QN5, Immortal Technique, Del the Funky Homosapien, and many others…my favorite tracks were always the posse cuts. Three or more rappers on a crazy beat, all with different flows and vibes. Ever since then I’ve wanted to make one…it took me 9 years in the music industry but WE ARE HERE!\n\nI’m so grateful to Reo, Iman and Aly for helping me realize my dreams with this WEB3 POSSE CUT.  This has been CACOPHONY. Thank you for listening. I also hope you'll all join my new collector chat, launched to commemorate this special occasion: \n\nhttps://guild.xyz/dreaming-of-flying\n\nfrom Iman:\nLOL LOL. WE THE SHIT, CAN’T YOU TELL?! as a taurus, i found the bulls on parade theme very fitting. then the beat dropped and i knew we had a classic on our hands. grateful to be on this track with three legends. \n\nfrom Reo:\nThis song will change your life.\n\nfrom Lackhoney:\nWhen I first hit play on this one I immediately started screaming in the car about how crazy it was. Honored to be a part of it. Bulls On Parade forever. CACAPHONY forever.",
