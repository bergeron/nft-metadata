    "description": "The images of the rising moment were drawn with rhythmic molding and color to end up with harmonious art painting. The motifs of each work are images floating inside the artist. They are thoughts of every moment or miscellaneous things that come to mind as reactions to external actions. The data that were recorded a long time ago are repeated over and over again, but the combination is different from time to time. The elements of the combination are color, texture, shape, balance, beat, and feeling.",
