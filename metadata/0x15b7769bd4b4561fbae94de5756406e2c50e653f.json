    "description": "Innerdalen is known to be one of the most beautiful valleys in Norway, and it has a special place in my heart.\nWhenever I need to relax and clear my head, I travel to this place as it is soothing for my mind.\nThese cabins, below the 1452 meters tall mountain Innerdalst√•rnet, is a fantastic motive in all seasons.\nThis day there was more snow in this area than I had ever seen before, and I had this particular magical edit in my mind.\nSo in -15 degrees I put on my snowshoes and hiked up here, to get the shots I needed for my idea.",
