    "description": "A cold night, standing above a frozen lake overlooking one of the most incredible nights in the Canadian Rockies\n\nYet again, Aurora's forecast is looking promising.\n\nThree hours away, but it's been on the bucket list to capture lady Aurora above a frozen lake filled with methane bubbles. \n\nI took a turn into an unsealed road covered with snow, but it didn't stop me. \n\nWhen I got there, I couldn't find any Methane Bubbles but these textures on the ice intrigued me. \n\nAs the camera capture, the world rotates, creating this trail of stars.  \nCold, windy, covered with not only one but 3 layers - it still does not stop the shivering. \n\nBut the night took my breath away, lying on a cold frozen lake, watching a clear sky with stars shooting across the sky and a shimmering glow of Aurora on the horizon. \n\nNothing but gratitude for this beautiful world we live in.",
