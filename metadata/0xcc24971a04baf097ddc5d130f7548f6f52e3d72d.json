    "description": "Spinning lines fan out in intricate patterns, layering contrapuntal colors in a filigree of fine threads. Inspired by Burano, a small island north of Venice renowned for its lacemakers and richly-painted houses, Lace Factory opens a dialogue with earlier generative works like j.tarbell’s Orbitals – Variation A (2004) to discover within their shared stochastic structures how tradition and modernity, algorithm and anthropology, can be woven together into a vibrant and holistic new tomorrow.",
