    "description": "State of Nuevo León, Mexico, 2005-2010. This image is part of a 5-year project called Suburbia Mexicana. I wanted to document some of the unintended consequences of the housing bubble many cities in Mexico were going through. I was also very interested in the aesthetic questions posed by using ultra beautiful landscape imagery to represent ecological degradation. It is a nod to the romantic use of tragedy in paintings; a visual exploration of the grandeur of disaster as a way to comment on the other side of Mexico’s copy pasted ideals of homeownership.",
