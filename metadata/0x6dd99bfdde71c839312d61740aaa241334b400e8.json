    "name": "Broken Sun",
    "description": "Broken Sun is an outlook on a mythological apocalypse. The surface of the world is hostile and swept by devouring winds and ominous figures appear on the horizon. Instead of a precise description of hypothetic future events, Broken Sun shows a symbolic vision that would be haunting the collective conscience of humanity. Among many things, it has been inspired by the Book of Revelations and Jungian psychology.\n\nThis mix of photography and digital painting has been used by the electro band Hocico as the front cover of their EP 'Broken empires' in 2021. Various elements came together into this creation, including Icelandic landscapes.",
