    "description": "This Kohinoor is representing a classical artform from southern India during the Kakatiya dynasty at the Kollur Mine, Thanjavur painting - also known as Tanjore painting - is a celebration of the regionâ€™s rich artistic tradition, named after the town of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu, India. Tanjore paintings are known for their extravagant depictions of deities using vibrant colours and gaudy embellishments, especially gold foil. They are locally known as 'Palagai Padam' as it is mainly done on solid wood planks. Though the artform has undergone various changes over the years.Specially In 1773, a British garrison was installed in Tanjore and it became a base for British troops. As it evolves they were completed with little or no gold foil and avoided any glass or gem inlay. Though these paintings were grouped under the Company style of painting, they were typically Tanjore in style and characterisation, and were executed by the same group of traditional artists. The tradition of Tanjore painting is kept alive even today, mostly by a few dedicated artists based in Tamil Nadu. Along with the shift to the use of synthetic colours in the artworks, jackfruit and teak wood have also been replaced by plywood. The Kohinoor here shows the resilience, as after so many of colonialism and under foreign influence we are still tied to our roots and artistic tradition.",
