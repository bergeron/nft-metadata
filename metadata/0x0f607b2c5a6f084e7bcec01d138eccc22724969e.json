    "description": "So clear, yet enigmatic.\n\nSo simple, yet charismatic.\n\n \n\nThe beauty of this animal never fails to amaze me. This is my definition of an emblem of absolute power, beauty, and leadership in one shotâ€”a rare combination for sure. The eyes are spot on the goal or aim, the mane like a saint, calm pose like a monk, and would attack like a warrior in a fraction of a second. The greatest fear in the world is of the opinions of others, do you think this \"king\" could care much about what others are talking about?\n\n \n\nAsiatic Lions have their last habitat in the beautiful Gir forest, Gujarat in India. This majestic big cat was once critically endangered but with great conservation efforts now they are 674 as per the last census rule the jungle.",
