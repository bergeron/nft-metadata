    "name": "Taj Mahal",
    "description": "This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. Even though it was my second time visiting the Taj, it was just as magical as the first. I had the greatest luck to find the Taj Mahal in it’s best way, clear weather and with no scaffolding!\n\nShot on: Sony A7III with 24-70 f2.8\n\nCollector will also receive a 12x15 print.",
