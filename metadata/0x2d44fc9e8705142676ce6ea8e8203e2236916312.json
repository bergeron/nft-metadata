    "description": "I woke up in blood and sweat. Because I was really dead. So I'm pretty sure I'm not logically dead. But that doesn't change the fact that I just died.\nI draw my dreams. Buddha is one of them. I guess what I've been through has been heavy. Or I just slept on my left side. I do not know. But as a dark surface was coming towards me, the closest thing between me and death was the \"moon\".",
