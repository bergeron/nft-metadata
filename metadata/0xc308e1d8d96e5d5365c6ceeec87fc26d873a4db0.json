    "description": "\n\nIn addition to paintings that the author fills with deep meaning, there are works whose fleshing out of meaning depends on the viewer.\n\nWhen you look at my painting, you see an incredible labyrinth of colour in the details of symmetry and asymmetry. But here, like in the mystical journey of Theseus, there is a golden thread that can lead you out of the labyrinth.\n\n\nHere you can immerse yourself in the painting, in your thoughts... And, admiring every stroke on the canvas, understand it.\nHere I paint a picture with my eyes of love for the one who hurt me. My heart became the receptacle of all the different emotions with which I charged this canvas.\nI wanted to create a painting that speaks. To each his own, about the eternal and the dear.\n\nAfter all, it is an abstraction. Here everyone sees what he is filled with on the inside.\n12000x8000\nOil on canvas",
