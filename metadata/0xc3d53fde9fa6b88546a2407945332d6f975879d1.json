    "description": "If you're familiar with literature, then you may be familiar with the 12 Stages of the Hero's Journey. Step five of the Hero’s Journey is often referred to as \"Crossing the Threshold,\" or the point of no return. It signifies that the hero of the story has committed to the journey as they set off on their adventure. You can probably understand the parallels here to my own journey with #AI and #aiartwork.\n\nThe next stage of the Hero’s Journey – Test, Allies, and Enemies – marks the beginning of the second act. Building on everything that has come before, the protagonist should be challenged, putting their new abilities and knowledge to the test. \n\n\"The Journey Continues\" is the first piece in this collection, signifying the next step in my AI art expedition.",
