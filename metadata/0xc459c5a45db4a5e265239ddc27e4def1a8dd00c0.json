    "description": "In this work, I tried to express the vivid outbursts of anger of people with mental disorders.\nI understand more than anyone what it is.\nA little history about this NFT.\nThere was a moment when I almost finished my musical project, it took several hours, when suddenly my DAW freezes and I understand that I did not save the project (unfortunately my laptop is already old and this often happens), I canâ€™t do anything, I waited for minutes 30 in the hope that everything will return, but no, the situation was inevitable, 3 a.m., a mug of coffee, disappointment, repeated work, I even remember how I recorded the melody that stuck on the recorder so as not to forget it.\nBottom line: I did even better than before >-<\nAt the time of writing this text, my clock is 2:13 pm, I think it's time to go to bed. \nYou know, I remember how in my childhood I wanted to become a writer, and in fact, being one, I probably can be happy with myself, but it's too early to be happy.\nThe gif was also made by me.
