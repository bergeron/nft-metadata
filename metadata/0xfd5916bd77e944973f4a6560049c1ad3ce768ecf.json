    "description": "Creating is sometimes a kind of disintegration. But this fragmentation doesn't always harm us. Creating can also mean destroying the shells we hide for protection, the castles we have built around us, the caves we are thrown into.\n\nIn other words, we should also create in order to destroy the things that keep us away from life. Otherwise, we may be dragged into a life where we desire death.\n\nI like to think and write about my pieces. But it's definitely more satisfying to think about them and discover new things. So if you look at my pieces and discover new things, please share with me. And I don't think you should allow what I write to change how my piece makes you feel.",
