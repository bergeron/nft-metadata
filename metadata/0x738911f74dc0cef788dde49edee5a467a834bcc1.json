    "description": " Autumn doesn't hit culture and it's pride. It never gets old. So is his culture. The Rajastani culture of turban go back a long way in history  since 12th century. The people of Rajastan started wearing it as a protection to keep their head cool, later it became a part of their prestige and social status. A man wearing a turban is making a statement. The style of tying the yards of cloth, the color, the shape and other minor details reveal the wearerâ€™s religion, caste, region, social status, profession and the occasion it is being worn for.\nTurbans in hot desert areas are large and loose.  People from different parts of Rajastan come to the festival of camels, shepherds and culture to celebrate their identity. Even today, they consider turban as an integral part of their clothes and also of life because it is the pride of Rajastani men.The pride grows with them as they get old. But the pride never gets old. \n\nEDITION :  1/1\nLOCATION :  RAJASTHAN,INDIA\n",
