    "description": "Losing a loved one can cause deep wounds in our hearts And it portrays the world so cruelly that we forget love and beauty even exists, also the feeling of loneliness and endless deprivation never leaves us.\nWhen all these feelings filled me up, I set out on a journey to find the peace I had lost. I searched for peace throughout the city and when I reached the sea I just stopped and watched it hugging me; The sound of waves, its deep blue color, and the clouds that moved parallel to it Little by little, that view took my soul with it until the moment when I saw nothing but silence and peace in me, what I was asking for was suddenly given to me which was peace after the storm. I had forgotten that the world, with all its hardships, is a gift for living, just as death is a gift for the beginning of a new life.",
