    "name": "Peony Bloom",
    "description": "This is a traditional painting done with acrylics, graphite and charcoal pencils on archival paper.\n\nPeonies symbolize a happy life and also a happy marriage. They bloom from late spring through early summer and their petals are edible.\n\nThey are native to Asia, Europe and Western North America. They live long and some have been known to thrive for at least 100 years!\n\nMarco Polo described them as 'roses as big as cabbages'.  I've created this piece at a time when we are expecting peony blooms to start in their native areas across the world. \n\nCollector of this piece on primary market also gets the physical piece shipped to them if they wish.",
