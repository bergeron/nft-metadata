    "description": "On April 1, six friends and I set out on a 42km ski traverse through the Canadian Rockies. The trip would involve crossing 4 high mountain passes, crossing numerous glaciers and icefields and navigating crevasse and avalanche terrain. \n\nThrough out the journey I was shooting with my Sony mirrorless camera, GoPro and my phone to document this remote part of the mountains. \n\nThis is one of the images I chose to represent this journey. \n\nThe first day we traveled from the highway to Bow hut. A relatively short 3.5 hour ski. This took us across Bow lake, through a narrow canyon before climbing into the alpine under the looming Vulture Glacier. \n\nThe following day we travelled across the Wapta Icefield and over the Yoho Glacier to Guy Hut, the newest Alpine Club hut located on the shoulder of Yoho Peak. We spent two nights there giving us a full day to ski in the area. \n\nOn the fourth day we travelled down the Des Poilus glacier, crossed Isolated Col before arriving at Stanley Mitchel Hut, a remote log cabin built in 1940 in the Little Yoho Valley. The following morning we departed along the Iceline Trail, crossed over Yoho pass and exited at the world famous Emerald Lake Lodge.\n\nOn the second morning we departed Bow Hut and started making our way up the headwall of the Bow Glacier in the shadow of St. Nicholas Peak, a 2970m shark fin that marks the start of the icefield. The mist gathered on the eastern side as the day warmed in the April sun. \n\nWe were departing as a guided group was on their way and I snuck this shot as they climbed to the south of me. Giving scale to the vastness of the toe of the icefield. ",
