    "description": "Poly Canyon is a series of 9 tokens, each one comes with an exclusive soundtrack made by Betathing 2020. The series documents ROM hacking experiments performed by Entter back in 2007 on the アタックアニマル学園 NES ROM (1987). As a result, several new ROM hacks were created and the original game became gradually destroyed. In the early versions only the game's sprites were replaced, and the game remained fully playable. Last ones were not playable at all, in the end game's source code was randomly modified resulting in hard glitches and screen freezing. Video captures of these hacks were then assembled into a custom VJ software made by Entter, in order to video scratch and add live effects. These Game Art visuals had been used by Entter in his VJ sessions around the world during the past years, from New York to Paris, Seoul, London and Berlin.\n\n00 P0L1 00:16\n01 P0L1 00:10\n02 P0L1 00:12\n03 P0L1 00:10\n04 P0L1 00:10\n05 P0L1 00:10\n06 P0L1 00:21\n07 P0L1 00:17\n08 P0L1 01:18\n\nNES ROM Hacks by Entter 2007.
