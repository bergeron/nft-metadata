    "description": "Conducted in Montreal before, during, and after the global COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, (Un)inhabited is a photography project that examines the concept of human habitation, particularly in public spaces that were once filled with people, life, and energy, and the tensions between familiarity and strangeness that arise when we confront these now-empty public spaces.  My goal is to convey this idea visually and examine how the pandemic has changed our relationship with the places we once frequented.\n\n*This is a 1-of-1 NFT. The physical prints of the artwork exist in the physical market.",
