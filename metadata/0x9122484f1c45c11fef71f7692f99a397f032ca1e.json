    "description": "‘SHAKE’ truly encompasses me in one song. Music and dance have always been a big part of who I am. My first music class at age 4 was called ‘music for the minis’ and it was a rhythm & beats class. I grew up as a classically trained musician and vocalist. \n\nFor this song I recorded very intentional samples and even used my voice to create a unique sound and infuse it with my energy.\n\nSo what is SHAKE about?\n\nWell, once upon a time I was part of a professional Tahitian dance troupe and it wasn’t until I was in rehearsals that I realized how disconnected from myself and my body I was. \n\nMama Kamai (the troupe mother) would go around the room and say to us, “get your shake”. I spent hours and hours practicing outside of rehearsals until I got my shake! I’ll always remember that moment because I instantly felt liberated and at home in my body.\n\nAs a DJ and producer, I’ve dreamed of making a song that honors this pivotal time in my life. ‘Shake’ lays the foundation for my album and I’m thrilled to share it as my Sound genesis.\n\nI hope it makes you move and maybe you’ll get your shake too. When in doubt, dance it out. It’s good for the soul.",
