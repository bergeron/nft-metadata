The cap is a barrier contraceptive from the 1920s that was heavily promoted by Dr Marie Stopes, the feminist pioneer of birth control in the UK and an ardent eugenicist. The interactive digital work stages the \"Prorace\" cap and its attendant history of the UK birth control movement and Stopes' eugenic feminism as a \"Matter of Care\": a complex thing that requires our careful attention. The 3D work invites users to become proximate to this object by digitally handling it and to ask critical questions about its meanings. \n\nThe cursor hand wears a latex glove reminiscent of both the clinic and the archive. Thousands of married women from the 1920s onwards encountered the \"Prorace\" cap in Stopes' birth control clinics, where they were fitted and learned to use it. Today, the cap and its related documents are encountered in museological and archival spaces that require similar protocols of contact and hygiene. \n\nThis project was commissioned by Birth Rites Collection with support from the Arts Council England. It was developed out of Nora Heidorn's PhD research, a LAHP funded collaborative doctoral award between the Royal College of Art and Birth Rites Collection. The digital object was made with creative technologist Jinia Tasnin. The original 3D scan of the \"Prorace\" cap was produced by the Science Museum, London, where the object is on display. The cap is owned by the Wellcome Collection, London. With thanks to Helen Knowles and Hermione Wiltshire for accompanying this project. \n\n*\n\nThe following fragments have been selected by Nora Heidorn from letters written by working class people in the UK to Dr Marie Stopes during the 1920s. The full letters were published in 'Dear Dr Stopes: Sex in the 1920s' edited by Ruth Hall in 1978. The authors of the letters are identified in the book only by their initials. Here, fragments from many different correspondents become an anonymous chorus that reveals something of the lived realities of Stopesâ€™ readers and the users of the \"Prorace\" contraceptives. The phrases have been transcribed faithfully and uncorrected, as in Ruth Hall's book.\n\n\n*\n\nI cannot afford to buy one of your books at present\n\nYour book came up for discussion in our psychology class and and the Dr said it was a very good thing to have in the hands of Drs and Scientists but he strongly advised none of us to read it which of course made us all very keen\n\nAnd really some of the things you propose in your book might have emanated from the brain of a Kaffir woman\n\nI am wonderfully surprised at the homely unobjectionable manner your pamphlet deals with the subject\n\nI have never read any of your books never having had enough cash\n\nI am an orphan and so you are the first I have unburdened my very soul to\n\n\n*\n\nPlease excuse my seeming cowardice but I'm getting married Easter, and I'd like to feel safe and free from danger.\n\nPlease Help me!
