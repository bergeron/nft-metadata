    "description": "“Red Shot” is the simple but of great impact artwork created by Stella Scala and Simeone Crispino to enter the NFT world. The red color shoots the monochrome as metaphor of the world where we live. The stain spreads and permeates the environment by entering your imagination, your visual and sensorial perception. The mission of Vedovamazzei is to change once again their perspective: their storytelling will make you realize they changed again their art style, but the communicative impact of their works is the same as before. Mixing styles to create new forms of communication lies in their DNA, and approaching to the blockchain has been a direct consequence of their ever-changing artistic experimentation. This is just the dawn of a new journey made of art and storytelling.",
