    "description": "A beautiful morning in the Tahitian waters...\n\nI woke up early that morning (around 4 am), as I always do during whale season. The ritual is always the same : getting the coffee ready, checking up on gear one last time and packing it, watching the forecast and heading to the harbor on the west coast of Tahiti.\n\nThe day was cloudy and spotting whales breaths was made difficult by the sea being rough. After a few hours, I saw this young beauty from afar. We stopped about 80 meters away, I put on my fins and slowly entered the water. After a tough swim, I managed to catch up and was rewarded by her swimming around me for a while, often making contact with me.\n\nShe was the only whale I got to see that day, but the experience was beautiful and well worth a long day",
