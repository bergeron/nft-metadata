    "description": "What is the value of this? And what does success look like? \n\n\"It wasn't even anger, it was disappointment. It wasn't even sadness, it was naivety. And when you give all of your passion for someone else's quest, what is it anyway that is now left in your nest? Will you wait to see what happens or will you fly away first? Will you fly away faster or will their bullet catch you first? And listen up now dear, 'cause after everything you've done, in their eyes you can no longer work. And after all of that hard work, they wont even want you close. How can they easily forget all the passion that you gave? Well, all it takes is just a loser, pinky post its, and her nerves. I need to say goodbye now, but I have a few more words to say: don't trust he who calls you \"superstar\", for he is full of shit. \" - Edua Sykes\n\nRedundancy is about canalizing all the negative energy around you, and turn it into something positively beautiful. \n\nHigh pigment fluid acrylic on canvas.\n4330X5772\nJPEG\n\n",
