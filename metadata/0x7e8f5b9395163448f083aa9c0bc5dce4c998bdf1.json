    "description": "No one remembers who the king was that once ruled these lands. But today, his image rose up on the canvas before my eyes.\n\nThe Lord of the Dead sits on his throne, surrounded by ruins and skulls. In his hand is the sacred sword, covered in dust and bound to him by a chain. The hero was crowned with a chain of shining links behind him.\n\nThe skeleton's gaze was directed into the distance, towards a future he would not see, because all his friends have already died. He was alone, ruling over the world of shadows and oblivion.\n\nBut who can rule a world where everyone is dead?",
