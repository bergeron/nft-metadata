    "description": "Back like I never left… Wait a minute I never did!\n\nWhen I first joined web3 I was hosting twitter spaces, talking in discords  and learning so much about this new found community and tech. I’ve been able to do some cool things in Web3 and meet some of the most talented giving humans ever.  Last summer I ended up working on some stuff outside of web3 and couldn’t help but feel like my impact and voice had been weakened because of a lower frequency of engagement in the space.\n\nWell, this is me saying I’m back and this drop will act as an introduction to the world building want to engage in with my next album and in Web3. I felt it would only be right to drop my song “Comeback King.” This song is anthemic and uplifting and it’s just an opportunity for me to not only remind the world of who I am but also myself. \n\nThe song’s lyrics tell my story in so many ways. I am an individual who has faced challenges and setbacks. But I am determined to rise above them and come back stronger than ever.  This is a declaration of resilience and strength in the face of adversity.  I hope this song gives you the motivation to keep pushing forward. \n\nWritten by James Gardin\nProduced by Charlie Beans ",
