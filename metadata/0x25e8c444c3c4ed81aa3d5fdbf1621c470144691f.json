    "description": "A painting with largely dark tones of blue, red, and brown, showing a man seated at the left side of the painting after what seems like an attempt to leave Earth. \n\nThe man is seated, smoking a joint, it seems as though he's having a conversation with a wispy spectre, perhaps a voice in his head, or a hallucination, telling him, 'The show must go on'.  \n\nThe background of this piece could be described as cosmic, or surreal. Objects in this painting includes, a broken noose, a turned over footstool, a suicide note, a dead hibiscus, and a dark green coat.",
