    "description": "Inspired by the procedural repetitive patterns that are quite common on a lot of African fabrics,  \n‘Askew’ borrows the same principles of using simple shapes and bold colours to create patterns.  \nIn this case, lines of different thicknesses (weights) are recursively drawn throughout the canvas  \nwith segmented breaks in between them. As the name suggests, the lines are rotated along the  \ncanvas giving more presence to the simple lines. All this is brought together by the organised  \nchaos resulting from the asymmetry and subtle nuances that can be spotted up close.",
