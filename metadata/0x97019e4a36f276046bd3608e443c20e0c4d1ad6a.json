I made this piece as reminder to myself that nothing will last forever. this collage was mainly inspired by my current situations with my family, friends, lovers, and peers. I recognize that many of these repeated experiences don't lead to a brighter future for myself and for those involved. as I went I began to project feelings of confusion and frustration through lines, shapes, colors, and imagery.\n\nthank you <3",
