    "description": "Ballerinas, an exquisite mix between delicacy, strength, movement, contrast and harmony. I used golden body paint on the ballerina as gold is the indelible ancient representation of immortality and power. My body mandala technique is a vehicle to immortalize them in an infinite dance. Years of dedication and hard work transformed into a living sculpture.\n\nSeries: Golden Ballerina\nResolution: 3,333 x 3,333 px .MP4\nPhotography work & music by Federico Bianchi",
