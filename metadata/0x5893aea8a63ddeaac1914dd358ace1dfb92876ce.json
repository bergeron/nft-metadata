    "description": "These 3 artworks were made for Design Week 2022 in Milan. They will be exhibited at Studio Rö.\n\nThe videos of the spheres are created using artificial intelligence with sound vibrations.\n\nThe first one is the vibration of the Earth (土 Tsuchi), the second one of the Nature (自然 Shizen) and the third one of the Brain (脳 Nô).\n\nThe difference in frequency can be clearly seen when looking at the 3 artworks.\n\nThe generated waves are also created with the help of sound vibrations.\n\nThe final rendering is generated with Blender.\n\nThe realizations will be available in 4K.\n\nAll this work is the result of about 3 weeks of work.",
