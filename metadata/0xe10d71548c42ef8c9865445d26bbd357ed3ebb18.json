    "description": "Not about beauty, although you may find that here too. It's about honesty. The body is more honest than words. What looks incredibly easy from the outside may turn out to be hard work. You always see only part of it.\n\nDedicated to all who have heard about themselves or their work:\n- It's corny.\n- You're mediocre.\n- Leave it alone, it's not your thing\n- You're a loser\n- You didn't do anything special\n\nI got lucky. I've always had people around me who have been my support.\n\nThe text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. There's a reason for that.\n\n1/1 Art by Anna O'Neill\n2666*1500 px\n\n30% from the sale of the art to my fellow dancer.",
