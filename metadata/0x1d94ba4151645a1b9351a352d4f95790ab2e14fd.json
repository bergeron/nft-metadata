    "description": "“ THE  SANGAM “\n\nSangam in Sanskrit means Union. \n\nIn this art  piece , we  see the union or  merging  of two  mighty Himalayan glaciers melting and flowing with rich in minerals carried by their parent glacier.\n\n “ The Zansar “ Sangam, located in India's Ladakh region,\n\nLadakh is  a world of rugged valleys, snow-covered mountains, endless hills, clean and curvy roads where centuries old monasteries have still maintained their charm. On our way to the Garkon village, we witnessed the confluence of the Indus and Zanskar rivers which was a rare sight, one can clearly differentiate between the two waters from a distance.\n\n\n\nArtist: Kiran Govind\n\nItem: 1/1\n\nCamera: Nikon 850 & Nikon 24-70mm F2.8 Hand held\n\nDimensions: 5000X3000 , 300 PPI, 6 MB\n\nLocation: LADAKAH, INDIA\n\nDate of Capture : July 2017",
