    "description": "Hundreds of sharks gather off the coast of O‚Äòahu riding the ocean currents that bring large amounts of nutrient rich water up from the depths. \n\nThese aggregations are in perpetual motion, as sharks jockey for dominance, constantly challenging the hierarchical structure that has formed throughout.  It‚Äôs a constant ballet of complex social behaviours that, in most cases, don‚Äôt lead to violence. \n\nCaution is always required as the sharks will often approach to investigate my presence in their environment. They may even decide to challenge my position at the top of the aggregation. \n\nüñºÔ∏è Edition 1 / 1  \nüåè Location: 21¬∞42'53.8\"N 158¬∞11'04.9\"W  \nüóìÔ∏è Captured: March 2020\n\nAn image by Ryan Sault - A diver, underwater photographer and adventure lover.
