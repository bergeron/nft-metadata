    "description": "In the renowned Japanese myth “Amano Uzume no Mikoto”, Hime (姬) is a semi-clothed celestial being who embodies and symbolizes the beauty of women. In the myth, in order to save the world from darkness she performed a special dance called “Tenshin no Mitsu”, to entice Amaterasu with her allure and elegance. Inspired by the celestial myth, in Model Eros Village, four Japanese goddesses are determined to bring out our raw, primitive desires; and save the world from being shrouded in darkness using their femininity and tenderness. They will be featured in the 3888 NFTs that make up the 2nd generation of MEV’s collectibles.",
