    "description": "The catastrophic civil wars that are happening in the world and Middle East inspired me to create this painting series. I immigrated from Iran to the United States in 2010 and over the past eight years the map of the Middle East has been ripped apart chaotically and I have taught myself what nuances helped to make them happen allow me to present my works before I examine it through the lens of contemporary philosophy and art.\n",
