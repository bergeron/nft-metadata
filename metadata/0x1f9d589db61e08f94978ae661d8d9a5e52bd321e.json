    "description": "Almost a year after her debut EP, Lauren Juzang released her first single “Yeehoo!” from her upcoming project on November 9. “It describes the little moments when falling in love when there's nothing you can do about it,” Lauren says about the song. “It’s fairy-like, sort of in the way falling in love is. It’s my favorite thing I’ve made, and I still get the same feeling listening to it as the day I wrote it.” “Yeehoo!” originated from a guitar riff that co-writer Gabe Yaron posted on Instagram that Lauren wrote over and brought to long-time collaborator Jason Vance Harris to produce.
