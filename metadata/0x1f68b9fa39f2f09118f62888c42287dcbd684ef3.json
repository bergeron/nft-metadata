    "description": "This photograph was made in Astoria Park in August of 2019. I had gone out for my daily walk and the light looked really dismal. Gray and washed out. My sister who was also down by the water but in Red Hook, Brooklyn had called me to chat when all of a sudden the sky lit all the way up. We both were like \"you seeing this? This is crazy right? Lemme call you back.\" I ran back into the park headed down to the water when I saw this group of kids enjoying the sunset on top of a hill. It looked so heavenly, it looked like the top of the world, and I knew I had to make their picture. This image inspired the rest of this collection, and there is no image more suited to be my first NFT.",
