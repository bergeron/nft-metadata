    "description": "Aʀᴛ Uɴᴅᴇʀɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ is a diverse collection of 1/1 artworks that spans the artistic journey of its creator. \n\nFrom my beginnings as a local street artist, to the study of art history, which was undertaken alongside my medical studies, to traditional photography, which I conducted during my work in various conflict settings, the collection culminates with a focus on AI art and the post-photography genre. \n\nAʀᴛ Uɴᴅᴇʀɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ represents the merging of diverse influences and techniques to create something new that is simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar. It also represents the power of art to transcend traditional boundaries and to break down barriers between seemingly disparate genres.",
