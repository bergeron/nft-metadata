    "name": "Broken DNA",
    "description": "I want to show that DNA can be broken by a wide range of factors, including radiation and chemical exposure.\n\nInspired by this, I set out to create a minimalist representation of the DNA that would capture its delicate and ephemeral nature.\n\nBy stripping away all extraneous elements and focusing on the essential components of this remarkable structure, I hoped to convey the idea that even the most fundamental aspects of life are fragile and not permanent.\n\nMy hope is that my art will inspire others to think more deeply about the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, and to recognize the importance of protecting and preserving our planet for future generations.",
