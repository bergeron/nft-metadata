    "description": "We live, we love, we wonder, we pray, we wait, we are unaware. There is a balance, this balance is the only thing that holds an eminent battle from happening. Armies are ready on both hell and heaven, waiting for the signal. We may not know, but the eternal struggle is real between good and evil, it reminds us of our internal struggle as well, the constant battle, there are more on us than just good or bad, it is a matter of perspective, so keep wondering and live your life, any action can bring the war to the surface.",
