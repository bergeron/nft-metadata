    "description": "This piece highlights the intensifying and ongoing debate over the validity of AI generated imagery in the art scene, it's place in art culture and its potential imapct on other forms of artistic medium and expression. \n\nWhat is art? Does the method of its creation affect the way it resonates with an audience, and should that matter if it connects with someone? \n\nCreated in Adobe Photoshop. 3670x2048. \nCode taken from Disco Diffusion v5.6 \n\n(NB - I am not affiliated with any AI / GAN art software or facility.)
