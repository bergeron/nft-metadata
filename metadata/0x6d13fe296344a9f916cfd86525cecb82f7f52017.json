    "description": "“ Fireworks festival in the summer.. A young man who came from abroad.  stepped foot into the city of lights\n    This is an annual festival.  It is an event held in the summer.  There is a convenience store  and various shops  The music and the sound of the colors make the night go bustling.  People were constantly pouring in.\n    I walked down the aisle  along with picking up the camera to capture the surrounding atmosphere  before going to find a sitting corner that is a bit far from the walkway point.  Soon, the fireworks were lit up in the sky.  Before the floating lanterns that were shining brightly slowly floated upwards\n    \n     As I was about to take out my camera, I took a picture of what was in front of me.  turned to see a young woman sitting in the back  She was anxiously staring at the lights floating in her palm, and my eyes were looking at her as well.\n      “This is probably the best festival for me.”",
