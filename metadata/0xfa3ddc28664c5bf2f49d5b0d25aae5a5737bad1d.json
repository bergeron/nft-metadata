    "description": "This work is part of the # CryptoArt4Children project. All proceeds from the sale of this work will be donated to Save the Children and will be used to support girls and boys and families fleeing the war. \n\nThe Lost Clods series is about people who did not survive. For various reasons they have not been able to move forward or have not been able to organize themselves to create a new life.\nIn this case the Clod represents, in an almost dreamlike way, how children find themselves in situations such as war. The loss of their whole world such as games, friends, parents and then abandonment and finally the loss of life itself. Difficult situations to deal with even for adults, in which you can do nothing but give help and a little affection, trying to heal a minimum of wounds that are difficult to heal.",
