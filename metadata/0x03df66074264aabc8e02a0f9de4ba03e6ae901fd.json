    "name": "YIN YANG",
    "description": "'Yin Yang' is the first ever physically exhibited digital artwork since the birth of my art gallery â€“ The Nnart Gallery. It has been represented in 3 physical exhibitions and 1 virtual exhibition between the years 2019 to 2021. Now minted to the Ethereum Blockchain after 3 years of its creation, I hope for it to find its true collector.\n\nYin Yang is inspired from my love for abstract patterns with a play on illusions. I love to create my idea of art from an unconventional means and perspective. I made Yin Yang with the idea of letting loose with my design. It is the first original Nnart Gallery piece and holds a monumental part of my growth as a digital artist.",
