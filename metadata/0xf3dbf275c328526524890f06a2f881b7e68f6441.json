    "description": "This is ordinary character in a funky and funny project called RUSH RYHM.\n\nAs it sounds, the project describes a rush in the rhyme of our lives when everyone is somehow forcing to work more than 1 job to secure the cost of living.\nNonetheless do we need joy and a bit craziness to draw yourself to an inspirational life? We all do. Let us help you finding fulfillment, and facing fear while finding balance between our spiritual and pragmatic beings.\n",
