Different situations make us experience a sharp contrast of emotions, is under the spotlight and humbly accept the burden of circumstances. Wholeness in opposites is like Yin Yang. But do not forget that we are all just dummies in the incomprehensible hands of fate.\n\nFirst piece from the \"Fantastic Creatures\" collection.\nOriginal Dimensions: 4320 x 2700.\n\nCreated with Blender, Cycles / Marvelous / Mixamo.",
