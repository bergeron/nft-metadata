    "description": "Today's world is changing a lot. But one thing remains unchanged: news and its role in people's minds. Information is the real weapon of 2022. \nInformation is abundant, it is like a spore that takes over your mind.\n\nTelevision is the tumor of our age. It controls people's minds, makes them think about things that are not there. \nIt is a tool to influence people, to influence their thinking, in a word, it is zombification. The news goes 24/7 pumping more and more information into our brains. \n\nWhat is the point of television today anyway? We have begun to forget what we live for, that we are humans, not machines. I think we've had enough of this television.\n\"FakeNews.2022\" is my vision for television today and its future \n",
