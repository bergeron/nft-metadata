    "description": "A moratorium on the death penalty has been in force in Russia since 1996. Since then, death sentences have been commuted to 25 years in prison or life imprisonment. \n\nIvdillag in the heart of an impassable forest in the Ural Mountains is one of the few prisons in Russia where these former death row inmates are kept. It is a severe regime camp built during the Stalin era. The convicts live in cells that can accommodate 4 people. Those who violate the rules of prison discipline are locked up in tiny cells for periods of six months, which can be extended at the discretion of the administration.  \n \nThose who escape the death penalty and are sent to Ä°vdillag are greeted with the phrase: \"Welcome to hell, from here you only get out in a coffin!\" \n\nUntil now, no one has been able to escape from the hell of Ivdillag. \n\nI was able to spend one week in this camp in 1997, after long negotiations with the Russian judicial authorities.",
