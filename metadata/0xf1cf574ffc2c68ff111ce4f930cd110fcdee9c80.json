    "description": "This Photography was created as part of my friend and Aerial Hoop artist Joana Dias for her Circus School final Project.\n\nWe have walked around London to capture some artistic photos to include in her Portfolio.\n\nAn older work of mine that I am very proud and that I Love.\n\nSome People will not like the fact that none of the lines on this image are straight but that is the idea. Because when she is performing, she hangs and fly all over."
