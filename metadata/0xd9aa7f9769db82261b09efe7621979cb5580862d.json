    "description": "1/1 NFT - embracing change.  3840x2160 PNG.\n\nThis NFT series called “Wrapped Future” represent pivotal moments of change: sometimes we take decisions through personal and past experiences that wrap around us acting as a filter in our decision-making process.\n\nMarble and Glass are here representing the past, controlling not only our decisions, but also our feelings, thus keeping us stuck in the same place mentally and physically.\n\nGold represents the future, in #4 morphing the past into the future, reaching for light.",
