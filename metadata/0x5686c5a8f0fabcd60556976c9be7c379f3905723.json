    "name": "Flying Rocks",
    "description": "Shooting in Long exposure mode provides interesting views you wouldn't normally see. When I first saw the result on my camera, I immediately thought these rocks were like flying over the clouds. Even one of them reminded me of some spaceships from the Star Wars series. If you look closely, you will see what I mean. \n\nA long exposure also helps calm down the relentless ocean waves hitting the rocks! This is why this image is so special, as it holds both the calmness and relentlessness inside it!",
