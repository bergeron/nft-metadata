    "description": "In searching for life's meaning, I confronted my shadow self. Darkness surrounds us, and now I embrace it. A meltdown is tough but also a redeeming moment of clarity, whether it happens in the mind or in the markets. All that remains on the other side is what was true gold in the first place. Facing one's own shadow might be the hardest thing we can live through.\n\nMelted Mind (2023) delves into the complex nature of the human psyche. This spectrum of color is the 1 of 1 piece that completes the limited edition set, including Red or Blue colorways. This drop continues the theme of duality, ever-present in these explorative artworks representing the hot and cold, infinitely moving nature of all things.\n\nJust be, and let any emotion or situation melt away. This too shall pass.\n\nDrawn with Procreate\nGIF+PNGs included\n2160 x 2880 pixels",
