    "description": "Kali, the most ferocious avatar of Goddess Durga, is often depicted as a powerful woman, carrying a weapon in her many hands, fighting evil and defeating demons.\nShe rides a tiger, a symbol of her fierce nature and immense power. \n\n\nNot only for her fierceness, but she is also known for her kindness and compassion - she looks out for her kingdom and fights injustice. \n\nKali is not a figment of mythology; she is alive and well in the women around us. She is the embodiment of strength and courage. She is the friend who stands by us when we need her the most, the fighter who never gives up, and the leader who inspires us to be our best selves.\n\nShe is present in every woman, reminding us of their power and potential. In today's world, we see countless examples of women who embody the strength and courage of Kali. They’re multi-dimensional, perfectly imperfect, and ever so beautiful.  Running her own world, there’s a Kali in every woman.\n\nViewable in AR\nSize: 2500 x 3000 px",
