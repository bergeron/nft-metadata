    "description": "The following music NFT is my initial response to Albert Bierstadt's 'Mount Starr King, Yosemite', recorded on Nov. 10, 2022 via voice memo at the Wyndham Philadelphia Historic District in Philadelphia, PA.\n\nThese audio sketches contain the melodic/harmonic/rhythmic content that will underpin the final art music composition. Each audio sketch will be airdropped to the wallet of the individual who collects the final NFT.\n\nThe cover art is a screenshot (edited for transparency) from GLM, a software for Genelec’s SAM monitors.\n\nMy 8330 SAMs calibrate by playing a sine wave of the audible frequency spectrum and measuring reflections off of nearby surfaces. This in turn generates a graph of the room’s response. \n\nI like to think of these graphs as the sineprints wherein my creative process began.",
