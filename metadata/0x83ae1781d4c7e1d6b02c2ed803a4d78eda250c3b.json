    "description": "My work is inspired by the painting of Boris Kustodiev. This Russian artist painted the Merchant wife at tea in 1918. He was a great poet of hedonism, satiety and prosperity.\nMy woman knows how to enjoy it as well. But unlike the Kustodiev’s women, in the 21st century she can be a strong and independent woman.\n \n—\n\nI finished this work on February 21st. On February 24th, the war began.\nAnd it is so strange now to realize that Kustodiev's work is a monument to the well-fed life of selected sections of the pre-revolutionary Russia society.\n\nWe do not always know what the future holds for us. But the present is already speaking.",
