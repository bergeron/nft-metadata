    "description": "Bajan producer and rapper Haleek Maul delivers raw, unfiltered grit with his new track “LOOT.” Underscored by a bright, Afro-informed beat, Haleek’s flow effortlessly moves like strokes across a canvas as he paints with deeper, brooding tones. \n\nFocused on amplifying and chronicling artifacts of African and West Indian multi-hyphenate artistry with his music and media incubator HOLDERSLAND, Haleek continues to build bridges and break down barriers with his unapologetic art and expansive approach.\n\n----\n\nThis is the fourteenth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
