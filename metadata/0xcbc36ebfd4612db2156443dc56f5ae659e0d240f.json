    "description": "The MUSES collection re-imagines the 3 Graces – goddesses Aglaia (brightness), Euphrosyne (joyfulness) and Thalia (bloom) who represent the interconnectedness of beauty, emotion and the arts. \n\nAccording to Greek poet Hesiod, Thalia and her sisters were born from Zeus and Oceanid Eurynome. Usually depicted nude, it symbolizes they cast off worldly attachments. Thalia translates to 'abundance' and 'flowering,' also associated with festivities, music, poetry, and fertility. \n\nAs a bridge between the physical and the formless, these entities inspire the pursuit of knowledge, beauty and creation, leading advances in human civilization. \n\nCaptured underwater using light painting techniques, MUSES takes photography to new depths.  Images and light refractions are created in-camera during this unique process.",
