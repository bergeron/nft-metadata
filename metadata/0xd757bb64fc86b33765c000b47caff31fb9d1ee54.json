    "description": "19th October 2020 - 31st January 2023\n\nThis special piece represents all the 16 images of the collection put together in a gradient of the sky.  \nIt shows how a landscape can change so much in the span of a few months. If you have a good eye, you can see the beauty in the life of everyday, even if you are not on holiday or in special places; just look outside your window!  \nIn this sequence the changing of the seasons and the colors is even more apparent than in the single images. From the cold colors of the snow and winter to the warm ones of the autumn. From the grey sky of normal cloudy days to beautiful, serene blue and pink sky!\n\nUnfortunately I wasnâ€™t planning on making a collection like this from the very start, and I happen to like more the mountains covered in snow. So there are no photos of spring nor summer from this perspective. A thing to keep in mind for the next time!\n\nI hope you all enjoy this collection and understand the meaning behind it!  \nWish you all a wonderful day!",
