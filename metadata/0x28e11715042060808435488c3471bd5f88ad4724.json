    "description": "EARTH WOMB is part of The Cosmic Mother collection, which is a series of artworks inspired by Mother Nature and our finite existence on this planet. This series seeks to explore our innate and complex relationship with nature and how we, as humans, are dependent on the natural world for survival. \n\nEARTH WOMB represents women's deep connection to nature, and the parallels that can be drawn between the oppression of the feminine and the destruction of the earth. \n\nHow do we turn our pain into POWER? How can we HEAL our relationship to ourselves and the planet? How do we NURTURE, PRESERVE and CELEBRATE the rich diversity that exists among all species? How can we RECLAIM our connection to the earth and begin to live in HARMONY with nature? \n\nThese are all questions that The Cosmic Mother series seeks to explore.",
