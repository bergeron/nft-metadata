    "description": "``Your light under the stained glass'' is a work that reflects a city, where the values that should endure and the dreams that allow us to move forward no longer abound, surrounded by a colonial design that endures to this day, giving prominence to time and into space. And a religious enclosure empty of truly sincere souls, where the wine was like blood and does not remain. Even if we lose confidence, his light will always be for everyone.",
