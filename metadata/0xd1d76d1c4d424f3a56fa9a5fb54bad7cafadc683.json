    "description": "This artwork is part of the collection Concr3t3 Jungl3, which is a collaboration between illustrator Danii Pollehn and photographer Nicky. Together, they combine the real and digital world in unique artworks, which celebrate female empowerment and representation as well as a new age. \n\nThrough their artworks, Danii and Nicky want to celebrate womanhood and the strength that lies within women. \n\nBy combining photography with digital illustration, and both artists physically working in different places when each element of their artwork is created, Danii and Nicky are also celebrating the bridge Web3 is creating for female artists between the two worlds of real and digital life.",
