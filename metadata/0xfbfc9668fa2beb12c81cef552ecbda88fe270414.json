    "description": "In the classical water drop formation technique, a drop is dropping into a water container which creates a water jet as a result of surface tension. If you drop another one into this rising jet and let them collide, liquid droplets will form. Photos, which were created with this technique, are called \" drop photos.\" A lot of effort has been put into the creation of the photographs in this collection.  This photo is 1498 x 2000 pixels.",
