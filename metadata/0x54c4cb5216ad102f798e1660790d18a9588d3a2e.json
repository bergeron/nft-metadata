    "description": "In 2014 I interviewed Wonderwall interior design firm Founder Masamichi Katayama for an upcoming issue of JOSHUA's Magazine. While I was in Tokyo, he took me to view some of their latest projects around the city, one of which was the Lexus Intersect building in Aoyama. It was there I discovered this nostalgic wall of toy cars, mesmerising and playfully precise â€” I just had to take the shot. Taken on a Leica M (Typ 240)",
