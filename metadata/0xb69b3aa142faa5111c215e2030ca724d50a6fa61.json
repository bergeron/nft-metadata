    "name": "A Beach Away From It All",
    "description": "It was our first time in Bali, Indonesia, and we started asking some travelers what their favorite beaches were. Surprisingly, most of the answers came from beaches located on a different island, Nusa Penida.\n\nOn the second to last day of our trip, we left our bubble in Canggu and took a boat over to that island. Upon arriving, we set off with zero expectations and motorbikes full of gas. Those next 8 hours were filled with some of our favorite memories from that trip.\n\nThis shot was taken from Kelingking Beach, where we walked down the ridgeline trail to the isolated beach below.  To be one of the first footprints on that beach that day was an indescribable feeling.",
