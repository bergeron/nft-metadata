    "description": "this song's about going through growing pains and communication mishaps as a newly long distance couple\n\nif there's one thing i've learned in my adult life, it's that long distance relationships are a work of the devil. \n\ni made this song at the beginning of the pandemic when sun and i had to be long distance, then she went to medical school and i moved back to nashville to pursue music and here we are. 2 years later and still subsisting off of 17 facetimes a day and a handfull of weekend trips to see each other.\n\nim a naturally spacey person, consistently losing my train of thought in the middle of sentences. when we're together its less of a problem but its almost impossible to deal with that over the phone.\n\nv1\ni broke us yeah i know\nyou can’t give dog a bone without expecting some fuck shit\ni always did make assumptions, i\nalways start the fight\nyou say another time\nyou got something to do tell me something\nwhen’s perfect? yeah\n\nchorus\ni mean you’re one in a million miles away\ndistance and thinking's a perfect pair\ni get a chance to get you right back you know i won't hesitate i want you, i want you\n\nrefrain\ni want you\nyou\nyou\nyou, yeah\n\nv2\ni’m just saying sorry\ni guess i can’t tell the time i’m sorry\nnever on time\ni guess some days i’m mad i’m sorry\nthen i’m sad\ntеll me what i did i’m sorry\ni’ve been a mess so many timеs i can’t track it\ni'm sorry yeah\ni'm sorry yeah\ni'm sorry yeah\ni’m sorry\n\nchorus\ni mean you’re one in a million miles away\ndistance and thinking's a perfect pair\ni get a chance to get you right back you know i won't hesitate i want you, i want you\ni mean you’re one in a million miles away\ndistance and thinking's a perfect pair\ni get a chance to get you right back you know i won't hesitate i want you, i want you\n\nrefrain\ni want you\nyou\nyou\nyou, yeah",
