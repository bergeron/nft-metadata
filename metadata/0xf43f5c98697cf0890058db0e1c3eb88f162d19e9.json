    "description": "Capital-rhythm is a world within VRChat constructed around the prompt \"K-pop debut\nperformed by capitalism.\" In this project, K-pop is a dance music genre with group\nchoreography of idolized singers, idols. The project explores the K-pop phenomenon as a\nreflection of our increasingly enumerable culture in parallel to technological development. The\nprompt stemmed from my interest in the desire to mirror our times through art. What is the\nessence of the culture of our times, and how can artists capture it within their work? What is the\ninner need of capitalism that perpetuates the creation and distribution of popular culture\nobjects? By contemplating the causality of the coercive nature of commercial culture in the\nform of sound and image in the entertainment industry, we can think about the present and\nfuture of the social system we live in.\n\nPresented NFT is Original Painting of Capital-Rhythm idols, HYPE, framed in a custom made metal frame.",
