    "description": "Marine Blues Re:boot Club 616 (MBRC 616) is a collection of 616 NFTS that were sold on MBRCâ€™s initial minting on July 11th.\nThe team stopped the minting due to low sales, and only 616 NFTs were sold that day.\nThe MBRC Team and holders have decided to rename the initial collection as MBRC 616.\nFrom this point on, our upcoming collection will be the main focus of our project, called MBRC. After much discussion among the MBRC team, we have decided that MBRC616 holders will have certain additional benefits compared to MBRC holders to show our appreciation for the holders that supported us, took a leap of faith and minted our initial collection.\n",
