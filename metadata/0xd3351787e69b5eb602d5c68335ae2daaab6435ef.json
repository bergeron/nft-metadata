    "description": "\"The Rush\" is the first piece in Eric Rubens Genesis SuperRare series \"Pigments\" which looks into the emotions unique colors possess. Deep Cerise is a very saturated, light warm rose reserved for the best sunsets. It carries feelings of passion, creativity, and a deep energy that pairs perfectly with the sea. On this night, it was ever present as Cerise brushstrokes danced across the sky. Wave after wave sweeps a shoreline and slowly shapes the coast. Just like each passing day, each wave brings a clean slate to the sand it touches. For a short moment in time, the colors and light dances across the surface of the ocean on perhaps the most colorful night I've ever experienced. The Rush is a testament to the energy of the ocean, the passion of a sunset, and the euphoric feeling of the setting sun. Allow me to introduce #da3287: Deep Cerise",
