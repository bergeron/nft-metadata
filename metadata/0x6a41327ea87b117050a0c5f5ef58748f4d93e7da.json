    "description": "My mind has touched the farthest horizons of mortal imagination and reaches ever outward to embrace infinity. There is no knowledge beyond my comprehension, no art or skill upon this entire planet that lies beyond the mastery of my hand. And yet, like Faust, I look in vain, I learn in vain. . . . For as long as I live, no woman will ever look on me in love.\n\nFlowers in this piece : Blue Flax, Phantom Orchid, Yellow Fritillary, Pussy's Ears, Tiger Lily, Stream Orchid, Coral Root, Yerba Mansa, Wake Robin, Small Tiger, Fairy Bells, Satin Bell, Western Blue Flag, Leopard Lily, Yellow Globe Tulip, Ookow, Our Lord's Candle, Ithuriel's Spear, Washington Lily, & Sego Lily\n\n3000x4000 px PNG\n1200 dpi",
