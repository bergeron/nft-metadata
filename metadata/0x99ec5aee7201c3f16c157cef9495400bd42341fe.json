    "description": "In a world torn apart by apocalypse, where hope has long since faded and darkness reigns supreme, two souls are destined to come together. One with eyes that glow like stars and a spirit that refuses to be broken. The other, scared and haunted by the horrors they have witnessed and the weight of their own fears. As they journey through a land filled with danger and despair, they will find that their paths are intertwined, and that together they may hold the key to bringing light back to a world that has been shrouded in darkness for too long.\n\nEdition 1/1",
