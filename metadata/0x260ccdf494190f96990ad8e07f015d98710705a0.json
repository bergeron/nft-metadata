    "description": "Grounded without gravity. Tangibility in fantasy. *Real Life* explores the physical realm in a digital world. As the lines of reality continue to blur, who can say what’s real and what isn’t. As life imitates art and art imitates life, maybe Picasso was right – “everything you can imagine is real”.\n\nCreated through sculpting in Virtual Reality, *Real Life* is a culmination of mediums. It is a digital creation brought to life through a process that feels strangely hands-on. It is a focus on the joy of creating art with your hands. It is finding warmth and intimacy in what can sometimes feel like a vast digital world.",
