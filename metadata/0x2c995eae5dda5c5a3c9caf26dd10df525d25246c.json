    "description": "This is 1 NFT in a collection of 10 photographs that I have been issued as a single, unique edition.\n\nPhoto: 5250 x 7000 px\n\nVictoria Falls was on my bucket list for many years. I had some feeling or calling that I had to see it for myself. And the moment I saw it, I fell in love like never before. \n\nThe energy you encounter is unbelievable. It is breathtaking and absolutely endless beauty. You can feel the power of nature under your skin. It feels like nothing else in the world is important anymore. You can feel yourself like just a grain of sand in the universe. \n\nThe flow of water is like the flow of life. Unstoppable and unpredictable. \n\nNow my life is divided into two parts: «Before» and «After».",
