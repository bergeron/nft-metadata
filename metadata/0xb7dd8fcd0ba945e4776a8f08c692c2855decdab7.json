    "description": "This exact road is fairly new. It has been off limits for years due to recent Volcano eruptions nearby. The road is on the largest active volcano in the world. Took me 2 hours hike in to capture this image. This exact stretch of Roadway defines what Road to nowhere means. Letting your mind wonder with endless possibilities while maintaining life. This Unique Image will be filled with cracks from earthquakes and Lava in due time. ",
