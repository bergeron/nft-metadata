The Mariupol diaries, chapter 2 - doomsday, the end - elaborates on the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine in the language of art: The background was generated with the help of AI from war images of destroyed Ukrainian cities. Spike 3D \"Blender\" objects represent Russia. The yellow generated trumpet 3D objects represent Ukraine under attack, asking the world for help. The patterns of the spikes were rendered using \"processing\" from the Russian flag and blood colors. The trumpets and metal objects were modeled using AI algorithms. The yellow traces of light represent the Russian artillery shelling of Ukraine. The blue ones the defensive battle of the Ukrainians. ",
