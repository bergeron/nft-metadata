    "description": "  This Muse is a stream of thoughts and awareness of the depth of space! My universe!\n  I drew her image in 2016. When I wanted to draw something for the soul. Then I drew commercial orders and children's illustrations. Now the art is drawn again! With great feelings! This work is very important to me. It brings me back to my feelings and true purpose.",
