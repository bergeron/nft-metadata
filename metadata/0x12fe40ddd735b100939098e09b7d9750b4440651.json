    "description": "An original ballpoint pen drawing done and signed in front by the artist. We are all dreamers, we live in this world and aspire for great heights in our struggles and endeavors. This piece resonates with me so much, I developed the idea in the catholic home where I’m currently lodged for my Youth service. I’m a dreamer and only my dreams can rescue me in the cold war(world) “On this flight, I pray I never loose sight” The only time we can visualize better is with our eyes closed as only then we really see the wealth inside us. The wealth inside is represented by the crown above my subject’s head and I choose the yellow color as “YELLOW” symbolizes richness and wealth. The circular ring round the head is the gene and It symbolizes the greatness that runs deep in our genetics",
