    "description": "Imagine a world without art, music or poetry. \"IMAGINE\" is a word that inspires free thinking and creativity. The \"Imagine\" sculpture was conceived in my mind and brought to life through manifestation and time and patience.   It's song is a mantra for generations to come, written by one of the most prolific musical artists of our time.  Its power sends a message that anything you can imagine can become a reality. \"Be grateful for your imagination as it will set you free.\"",
