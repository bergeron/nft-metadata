    "name": "Neptune",
    "description": "Neptune is a planet that influences spiritual and unknown aspects of human experience. It patronises herbs like poppies and other mind-altering plants.\n\nNeptune relates to the deepest wells of the subconscious and rules every aspect of our lives that is unseen and mysterious. This planet is associated with those subtle forces of life that dissolve and undermine the artificial barriers of time and ego. Neptune is the king of mysticism, illusion, as well as creative inspiration. The energy of this planet allows the soul to travel to parallel dimensions and comprehend all the subtleties of the spiritual world.\n\nWhile looking more closely at the artwork you may notice symbols that enhance the energy of the Planet of the Mystic. Neptune rules over such zodiac signs as Pisces and Sagittarius. You will also notice a Latin inscription \"Nihil Quod Esse Videtur\" translated as \"Nothing is what it seems to be.\"",
