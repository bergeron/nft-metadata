The set features depictions of three legendary creatures - Qilin, a symbol of good fortune in Chinese culture, Dragon, a revered divine beast, and Lion, historically referred to as Suanni in China. Using digital backgrounds, these creatures have been transformed into new and unique artistic representations, and are now preserved on the blockchain.",
