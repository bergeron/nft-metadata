    "description": "You notice a woman standing in front of you. She looks different to how you remember her, but true followers recognise her instantly. Although she's not wearing her signature cow horn headdress, she's wearing the symbol of Ankh and the Eye of Ra.\n\nMeet hethor15, the reincarnation of the Egyptian goddess Hathor on the Ethereum blockchain, indexed under block avril15. The goddess of love, fertility, beauty and pleasure has opted for a simpler form. She protects the actual Eye of Ra in her glass head. As the goddess of beauty, she's set new beauty standards where long hair and clothing are no longer a concern. Her consciousness is the true personification of beauty.\n\nSuddenly you hear a voice say “made you look”. It’s Waldo! Come to think of it, you walked in a cave shaped in the Circle Game hand gesture. A strong punch on the shoulder makes you realise that this was all a trip.\n\nReferences: Wakanda & Pharaoh crossed-arms , Pac-Man ghost, lava lamp, “Where is Waldo?” and the Circle Game.",
