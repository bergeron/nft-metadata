    "description": "This piece was originally created and available in June 2021 but unfortunately went almost completely unnoticed. It is ironically more relevant now than ever.  Here is an excerpt from the original description written that summer. \n\n“UEntitled is a visual commentary that addresses centralized influences on mostly decentralized intentions of the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThe story and background: I started this piece in early May of 2021 as a healthy expression of my increasing fatigue from seeing and hearing specific person(s) in the media both social and traditional. In some ways I felt I had to do this piece for myself, but then I realized others may appreciate where it came from, and be able to relate... \n\nI hope you enjoy this piece and also see it as a way to get some relief or amusement in these uncertain times. The world of cryptocurrency, NFT’s, and finance is kinda wild right now, so let’s just hold on and try to have fun.\"\n\n-Waldorf  June 2021\n\n(full description available)\n",
