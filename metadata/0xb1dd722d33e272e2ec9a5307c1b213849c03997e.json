    "description": "The First Nation people have a rich and storied history. For centuries, they have been a proud and independent nation, existing peacefully alongside their neighbors. However, in recent years, their way of life has come under threat. They have been forced to confront the loss of their ancestral lands, the loss of their language, and the loss of their cultural identity.\n\nDespite these challenges, the First Nation people continue to fight for their survival. They believe in the power of their dreams and their ancestors, and they refuse to give up on their culture. They are a proud and resilient nation, and they will continue to fight for their survival.  \n\nThis is a collaboration with @luciddreamnf1  \nMusic score by @PevenEverett",
