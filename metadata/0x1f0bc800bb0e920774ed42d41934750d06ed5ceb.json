    "description": "Like most of Lil Bubble's catalogue, \"Dump\" is a song about recent market events and the current climate of the crypto space. Every day's the same, wake up and I check, if the FED gon' pivot, is over? Cos I'm rekt. Production also by Lil Bubble.\n\nLil Bubble is a Web3-native musician & degenerate moon boy. The satirical character was born in 2019 with the release of crypto-themed parody songs like All Time Lows, When Moon, Liquidated and Never Ever (Selling Back To Tether).\n\nThe singing spaceman’s music videos have since amassed over 8 million views and led to performances at Blockshow Asia, Binance Blockchain Week Paris, NFTfest Australia and a number of industry collaborations. With a debut album on the way and plans to build a whole swag of experiences in the metaverse, the Lil Bubble character is set for expansion into the realm of possibilities we call Web3. Are you coming along for the ride?",
