    "description": "The Chaos Chimera is a creature of pure magic. Any attempt to explain it's existence is futile, for it is a beast that defies the natural order in its behavior and appearance. Chimeras can inhabit nearly any part of the world and thrive for weeks without food. When threatened, they can display a rage unparalleled across the Runiverse. There are rumors of taming Chimeras if they are captured while young, but even Chimera cubs are extremely dangerous and can kill grown men. "
