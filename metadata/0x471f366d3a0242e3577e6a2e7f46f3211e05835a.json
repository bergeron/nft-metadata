    "description": "This is a photo I took of a male Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) at the wildlife rehabilitation center for which I used to volunteer. I photographed him with my DSLR and re-scanned the image years later with my glitch camera. \n\nIn college, I worked with a Red-tailed Hawk named Eleanor through the raptor program that looked after unreleasable birds of prey. I cherish every opportunity I have to get to know individual animals and their personalities.",
