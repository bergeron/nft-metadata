    "description": "\"Rapunzel\" is a German fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm and first published in 1812 as part of Children's and Household Tales. \nIts best known line is, \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair\".\n\nDuring the Qajar period in Iran, even much later, there was a custom in Iranian families that unmarried girls should not wear makeup or even cut their hair until they were married.\n\nInspired by the story of Rapunzel, which I loved a lot in my childhood, I have shown a Qajar girl who loves her long hair and doesn't need anyone to save her.",
