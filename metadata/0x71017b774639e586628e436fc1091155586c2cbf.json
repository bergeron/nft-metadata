    "description": "A state of being that has overcome the limitations of physical existence and experienced a higher sense of spirituality. \n\nThe finite journey of mortality evolves into an eternal being of consciousness and becomes an inseparable existence in the divine afterlife.\n\nBillelis depicts the journey of one’s transcendence and acceptance into the divine afterlife.\n\n“ This work is a part of the #Dart2121 exhibition. From the 23rd of November 2021 to the 6th of February 2022, Milan - Dart Museum - Permanente di Milano - Wrong Theory “",
