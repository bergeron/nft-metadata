    "description": "This photograph was taken at 3am in the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the 2022 blizzard. The streets were empty, the snow was falling quite heavy at this hour and the city was asleep for the most part. As I was walking taking it all in, I was also looking for that specific moment I wanted to capture. I could see the Katzâ€™s deli lit sign from a distance. As I got closer, I knew it was the scene worth waiting for the right subject to walk through. I was there for about an hour, before the only people I saw was this couple bound to each other battling the snow to get where they were going. It was a matter of seconds I had to line up the frame as they walked through, I looked at the back of my camera and knew I had the shot I wanted.",
