    "description": "My other passion is to buy and restore vintage and antique objects – they all tell a story, and I am bringing back to the present, so they can carry on fulfilling their fortune. Gloucester Market offers is little known, but I have some habits there. And that day, I found a beautiful Victorian Telescope with a nice leather case. It lived its life , clearly, but my eyes got amused by its eccentricity – The old man explain to me it came from an abandoned mansion nearby in the Cotswold – no one knew who live there. He explained to me that the little planets on the top of it were here to adjust the view – he never saw it in his whole life. He dated the Object in 1875. That was a winner for me – and I bought it with no idea what to do with it. ",
