    "description": "#1 SHOCK\nWoke up from the message ‘They introduced martial law and I'm hearing explosions.’ Intense panic attack. Rejection and denial of reality.\n#2 FEAR\nMultiple parallel flows of real and fake news. Packing my small emergency bag with a vivid understanding that nothing is important unless it’s human life.\n#3 ANXIETY\nTexting ‘How are you?’ has really become important now. We're fucked but, please, tell me you're alive.\n#4 UNITY\nHave never ever felt such endless love, strength and unity with my people. The strongest nation ever lived.\n#5 ACTION\nI’m staying here to help my people who suffer more than me. Every mickle makes a muckle.\n#6 SUPPORT\nForever grateful for support from my friends around the world. <3\n#7 FAITH\nMaking the artwork and recording the sound of air raid sirens from my bedroom. We will win and rebuild the most beautiful country in the world. Glory to Ukraine!\n\nAll proceeds collected from this sale will split between UkraineDAO, multiple local funds and the artist.",
