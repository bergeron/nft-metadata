Anyone on NFT Twitter can suggest a move.\n\nThe first to reply to the board each day gets to make the move.\n\nOne move per day until there is a winner. You can play either side.\n\nAt any stage, anyone can stop the game by purchasing the board in its current state for 0.69 eth or highest offer.\n\nIf the game completes, the person who made the winning last move gets the board transferred to them as the prize.\n\nFIRST GAME WON BY: @alex8rite playing for Real Fakes",
