    "description": "A girl wearing a fox mask.\nThis girl's face is not shown because she is not a specific character.\nShe may be the girl you met that summer, the girl you will meet in the future, or yourself.\n\nI mainly used watercolor to blur the boundaries and depict her in a mysterious way in order to express \nthe memories of summer with her and the glamorous and secretive atmosphere.\nParticular attention was paid to her vivid yukata and fluttering hair.\n\nFireworks\nTamaya\" and \"Kagiya\" are the trade names of fireworks craftsmen in Edo.\nThe word \"fox fire\" led people to believe that Inari-sama was beneficial for fire prevention.\n\nWhile carefully depicting the fireworks that color the summer night sky, \nthe background of the fireworks and the night sky behind them are also blurred. \nWe hope you can sense the painstaking work that went into the seemingly simple black background.",
