    "description": "Sandile Dlamini, informal gold digger, Payneville, Springs, Gauteng, 2011\n\nFor more than a century, South Africa’s demand for gold, diamonds, coal and platinum has gone from strength to strength, often shifting in accordance with the political economy and the availability of foreign markets.\n\nThis body of work provides agency to those whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by mining processes and the long-term environmental ramifications, to expose the far-reaching neglect by successive governments and corporate bodies that have driven the mining industry.\n\nLegacy of the Mine, was produced between 2011 – 2013 and culminated in a book consisting of 83 photographs and extended texts, providing a resource accessible to a global audience. Published widely and acknowledged with several accolades. Legacy of the Mine, has been exhibited extensively and is held in public and private collections.",
