    "description": "Your personal imaginary silence. I represent different types of contexts and conditions through mixed media layers - this is the expression of mental transformations through various emotional states, feelings, connections and distortions of memories. Different stages of sadness, fears, high and low moods, anxiety, social isolation and some contexts of researching yourself and your inner voice.\n\nAll of the fragments were shot and created by me - experimental photography with a use of analog cameras and analog screens, 3D sculpture of transformed self-portrait, archive paper from 18th century with a custom print, handwritten elements, mixtures of mixed media typography - everything is combined on different paper layers.  \n_  \n2023 / Save My Vision",
