    "description": "The Asch conformity experiments were a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s to study the effects of group pressure on individual opinions and beliefs. The experiments involved groups of participants who were asked to make judgments about the lengths of lines. The results showed that many participants conformed to the group even when their own perception was clearly different, leading to incorrect answers. These experiments have been widely cited as evidence of the power of conformity and group pressure in shaping individual behavior",
