Fuji), this cryptoart piece combines various creative elements: photography, coding, animation, touch screen capabilities, interactivity and soundtrack. It took a lot of time to combine these many techniques, incorporate opensource code and study 3D pixel conversion in order to offer the viewer a sense of perpetual interaction with an artwork that is meditative, traditional and modern at the same time.\n\nMy aim remains that of storytelling and documenting, but being an artist, I'm also very interested in experimenting and evolving my photographic work through the use of new technologies and new ways of presenting it. \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" is the genesis piece in my evolving concept of creating interactive cryptoart by using my original photos to tell a story. \n\nSpecial thanks to Filippo Gregoretti (a friend, a developer and a great artist/musician on his own) for the work done on touch screen and interactivity.",
