    "description": "Sunflower fields face the sunrise in Buonconvento, Tuscany, Italy. The sunflower is also the national flower of Ukraine. The country is covered in fields of sunflowers due to the importation of the flower seeds from North America in the 1700s. Likewise, Ukraine is also the world’s largest producer and exporter of sunflower seeds and sunflower oil. \n\nIn a more symbolic sense, the flower represents warmth, strength, happiness, and hope. \n\n“Ukraine’s refugees need our help. The world can do more,” read the headlines in Sunday’s New York Times editorial section. “ The mass flight of refugees from Ukraine has created a nu-manitarian crisis that dwarfs anything Europe has seen since World War I. More than four million people have poured into neighboring countries, and as long as Russia's savage war continues, millions more will flee. Already, the flow of refugees from Ukraine is far greater than the number from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq who fled to Europe in 2015. But the scale of this crisis is staggering, and it is still in its early stages.”",
