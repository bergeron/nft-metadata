    "description": "As a colour blind photographer, it is rare that I embark on a colour series. Most of my work is monochromatic. We scouted the Kortum Bluffs area for the 2022 global Lenovo ThinkPad campaign and I was inspired by the colours I think I seeâ€¦or do see. Just different than you. \n\n1/1. \n\nShot on Leica Q2 Summilux 28mm f/1.7 @ 100 ISO, f/2.2, 1/1000 shutter. \n\nDimensions: 7620x5085\n",
