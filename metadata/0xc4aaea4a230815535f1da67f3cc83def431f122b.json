    "description": "I titled this piece with a subtle play on the fact that if you took the shortest route from A to B throughout this scene, it is a contrasting prospect to the road that has been constructed here. The twists & turns at ground level may seem perfectly logical, but from this unique aerial perspective, it's anything but.. and yet, there is always a reason, a purpose, to make such illogical things make sense. The same can often be said for life itself.\n\nAbout the artist: Johnathan Conlon is a published, award winning photographer specialising in landscape & aerial imagery.\n\nLicence: Extended editorial.",
