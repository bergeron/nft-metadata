    "description": "This art was created for a contest of the marketplace “NeonRain”. The main task was to show what you imagine when you hear “NeonRain”. Just because of the word “Rain” I immediately remembered a favourite cartoon of my childhood called “Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron”. There was a horse called Rain. I like drawing animals and especially the horses, so instead of the futuristic rainy dark night in a cyberpunkish setting I decided to create a fantasy art with a horse, but not just a common horse, but a unicorn from the neon world. Guess what’s his name? Of course, Neon Rain!",
