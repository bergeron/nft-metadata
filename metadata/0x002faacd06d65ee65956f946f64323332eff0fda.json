    "description": "Hey! I'm Midori!\n\nI am here to tell you about the creator and the collection. What? Are you wondering who I am?\n\nOkay, before you get to know the others, let's get to know each other better. I'm 21 and I'm a digital artist from Japan. I would show you my art, but that's not what we're here for, and there's too much NSFW out there, so let's do it another time, okay?\nI'm not as much into fashion as my sisters, but they try to educate me and often buy me something bright and interesting. Much more I like to work on the style of my characters as a creator! Actually, that's why I was the first of the girls to meet you.\nI also love cats very much, but I don't have any cats because of allergies. Probably why I wear these lenses. They don't look stupid to you, do they?\nI have very little free time due to work, so on weekends I like to just watch anime quietly and eat delicious foreign food in interesting places.\nWill you keep me company?\n＊All bidders will receive illustration NFT.\n6000x6000",
