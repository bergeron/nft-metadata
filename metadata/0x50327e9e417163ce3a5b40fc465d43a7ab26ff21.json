    "description": "The little Andy PFPs created by artist/photographer Karen Bystedt aka KBNFTQUEEN is an original generated NFT drop powered by Ownerfy Inc. with original illustrated elements and a cartoonized image based on an original photograph Bystedt took of Andy Warhol.  This drop was preceded by a comic strip which outlines the story of how little Andy was created. The Little Andy PFP collection includes rare and super rare PFPs like Little Keanu, Little Courteney and Little Brad. All are based on Bystedtâ€™s original photographs taken in the 80s and 90s. There is a Web three game planned called Little Andy.\n\nThese original images are registered with the copyright to Karen Bystedt and cannot be used for commercial purposes.",
