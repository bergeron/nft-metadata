    "description": "Two lifelong friends who came of age as artists in the early 90s\nexperimenting with “borrowed” software and a 56K modem\nnow reunite on ASync to offer ‘Lights’— a striking piece of\ngenerative art that continues their exploration of those\nquestions found at the edges of art and technology.\n\nWhen a song is finished, before it heads to streaming to meet\nan uncertain fate determined by an algorithm, before it’s\npressed to plastic—what *is* it?\n\nSyd Sidney answers with six unique audio “ghosts” of his\nupcoming single ‘Shining A Light In The Dark’, shaking off the\npop song form, inspired by the work of Eno and Cage, and\neliciting the feeling of a song yet to come into being.\n\nWhen a designer is enlisted to create artwork for a song,\ninstead of being confined to one square canvas, with untold\nnever-to-be-seen variations left behind, what if instead there\nwere millions of possibilities?\n\nATW answers with a collection of visual layers created using a\nflexible, hexagonal grid system inspired by the geometries of\nPlatonic solids and the tessellated works of M.C. Escher,\nevoking themes of connection and illumination.\n\nWhen combined, millions of prismatic possibilities await the\ncollector.\n\nTake that, single song with single art.\n\nAnd you—our audience—who are you? Will you be inspired to\nbecome one of our 1000 true fans and join us on this journey?\nWill you be moved to answer these questions yourself as an\nartist?\n\nWe hope so.\n\nThank you for shining a light in the dark with us. Let’s see\nwhere this path leads us.",
