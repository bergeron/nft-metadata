    "description": "The spaces that balance and counter our relationships. Filled by trials & triumphs. Our narratives flowing into each other. Shaped by the people we meet & collide with on our journey. Each one unique, yet each one lending color & texture to our own stories. The people we meet, the spaces we inhabit. Layered, multidimensional, simple and yet full of complexity & character. An expression of how we connect and the color that lends itself to our journey. \n\n5400 x 7200 px \nDPI 300\n4K resolution\n",
