    "description": "The first planet from the “Navaratna” collection is the Moon with its corresponding gem - Pearl.\n\nThe mysterious and mythical image of the Moon has always attracted the attention of humans. It is a powerful symbol of feminine energy, nurturing and protecting.\n\nThe Moon has always been a source of inspiration for the creative and gifted, while serving as means of communication for those engulfed in love.\n\nWe have come up with a soft and tender image of the Moon, her skin resembling pearl. Our Moon shines in the magical world like a white crescent in the night sky, distant and cold, yet delicate and subtle. \n\nShe is both an adult and a child, wise and naive. Her face displays an ever-changing emotion shifting from a blissful smile to deep sadness. And if you linger your eyes on our Moon, her image will slowly come alive…\n\n\"Moon Pearl 01\"\n4682  x  7024px,  jpg",
