    "description": "I am a Jamaican Reggae Fusion Artist, a peaceful warrior always looking on the bright side. Elevating collective consciousness one idea at a time, serving the SkyStarter community. \n\nSkyStarters are tenacious, creative, optimistic, compassionate and empathetic. They can also be misfits and misunderstood. The only requirement to be a Skystarter is that We Never Give Up. Within us is an innate power that comes to the aid of the resilient and weaving through the SkyStarter fabric is an unwavering tenacity to Never Give Up \n\nWake up created a portal that reminds me to always step into the NOW. Regardless of the past, what matters, NOW, is that I must pick up the hammer and get to work. This song is me coming to terms with the past and even the future. Realizing all I really have is NOW. \n\nI wrote this song looking for a new path to the same destination. I knew where I wanted to be but I know I wasn't going in the best direction to make it a reality. I became self-aware about the stories in my head and felt the courage and faith to wake up and create a new story\n\nWake Up is a call to take a hold of life and take our goals seriously. To be present despite the past, despite the future. Be present with all your mind, heart and soul. \n\nTo Wake Up everyday with a picture and a purpose, with intention, with gratitude. Wake Up is an ode to nature. An anthem for more love, for the hungry to be fed. A celebration to embrace who you are and Never Give Up.\n\nEach holder of Wake Up gets a free mint from the upcoming album collection, a private link to the album and access to a token-gated performance of tracks from the album.",
