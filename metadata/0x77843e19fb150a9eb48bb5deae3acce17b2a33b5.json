    "description": "Photograph of a fisherman cast netting on his small boat in my village in Kerala. Every monsoon, villagers perch along the canals and the lake with large nets to take home the fish brought out by the gushing water. \n\nFishing in the rain has become so much of a local sport that people even bunk work to get wet. They usually take home the fish they catch or sell it to the locals.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, and display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
