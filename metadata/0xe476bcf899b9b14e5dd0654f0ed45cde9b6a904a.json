    "description": "Back in college, I had a friend who I used to go spend some weekends at her house. They had this neighbor we called Sister Niks who used to hang out with us. She was a beautiful woman however she had a physical deformity: POLIOMYELITIS. \nHer husband was cruel and abusive towards her, even when she had their son. One time I was at my friend's place and we could hear him beating her. \n\nIn Africa, many men marry physically challenged women for several reasons such as a license to cheat, one he can easily control, an object meant to do nothing but bare his kids, take care of them, keep the house and satisfy his sexual fetishes, and so on. \n\n A beautiful, elegant and witty woman with all these qualities and more, yet they are all watered down by her being physically handicapped.\n\nIn view of this, I created this art to celebrate physically challenged women all over the world- a Nubian art showing the essence and beauty of a woman regardless of her physical deformities.\n\nSpec: 8000px X 8000px",
