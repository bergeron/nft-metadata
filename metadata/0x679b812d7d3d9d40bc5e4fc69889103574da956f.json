    "description": "An amazing  experience in Olsob Cebu, Philippines. \n\nWeekend getaway with my girlfriend turned my wifey üòç\n\nThis is one memorable trip wherein we woke up as early as 5am to swim with this beauty. The thing though while swimming with them, the fishermen gotta continuously feed them with baby shrimps so they stay close to us. Turned out I had some of the baby shrimps, upset my stomach and I ended up staying in a washroom to flash it for almost the rest of the day.\n\nEnd of story, we manage to still go on a date late night before ending our day üòç",
