    "description": "The Tibetan Hung symbol is probably the most popular of the various Tibetan symbols. Translated, this means ‘Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus.’ It is believed that everything essential that Buddha taught is contained in this mantra, which is indicative of the path to transform one’s impure mind and body into the pure, exalted speech and mind of Buddha through detachment. Needless to say, it is a quite powerful mantra and symbol, which can purify body, speech, and mind.\n\nWhen used in meditation or if recited daily, Om Mani Padme Hum: can remove negative karma and thoughts and help one achieve enlightenment and awareness. The last word, ‘Hum’ or ‘Hung’ means indivisibility or something which cannot be torn apart. It holds both wisdom and method and this cannot be broken or divided.\n \nPainted by Yura Miron in the beginning of 2023.",
