    "description": "Hellenic Goddesses is an all female representation of Olympian Royalties baseed on Greek mythology. \nFor me this collection of several Greek Goddesses goes beyond some graphic adventure. \nWhile designing these everlasting, glorious women I fell in love with their back stories, challenges and dramas. They are beautiful, warrior and smart figures that after centuries feel real and rather contemporary. \nHellenic Goddesses portraits some vibrant, shiny and challenging mythological women but I guess leaves with the question that how these magical female personalities could face our time.
