    "name": "Oh, Henry",
    "description": "When the the Memes of Production Engine first fired-up in the late 21st century, Henry didn't know what hit him.  He was on his way to Accounting for the third time that day - not because it was necessary, he and Mavis simply liked each other's company and his role in IT allowed him to roam fairly freely.\n\nThe warping of reality that happened for a few minutes when powering up the MoPE were labeled the 'Quantum Engagement Disruption' phase. Periodic \"QED\" wound up being a necessary part of proper maintenance.  Most would leave the area when QED was due, though some would seek it out, craving more of the psychedelic experience.\n\nOne moment Henry was approaching the cubicle where he'd find Mavis, the next, when his doors of perception opened, he was a peacock protected by golden armour.  Unfazed, he thought \"Bet the jabs from upper management can't get through this!\" as a wry grin crossed his lips.\n\nLifetimes could seem to pass in the few moments a QED took. Henry would be back for more.",
