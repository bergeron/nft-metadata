    "description": "\"Dance with my hands\" conveys the essence of the sisters' unity and the beauty of the dance. The two girls, their bodies in a continuous field of graceful motion, dance on the stairs, their hands reaching out to each other as a sign of unity and support. The falling smoke gives the scene a dreamy, ethereal quality, emphasizing the smoothness of the sisters' dance and their unbreakable bond. The stairs, meanwhile, serve as a metaphor for the journey of life, and the dance represents the joy and beauty to be found in every step along the way.\n\n«Windy Whispers»: a collection of paintings of ethereal girls. Each work celebrates the melting beauty of dance and the grace of fluid movement, highlighting beautiful hands. These paintings are a visual window to the soul. The fluidity and light permeating each portrait evoke the feeling of dancing in the wind that gave the collection its name. It will transport the viewer to a dreamlike world of beauty and inspiration, leaving them in awe and wonder.\n\nOlena Speakingtomato, 2023",
