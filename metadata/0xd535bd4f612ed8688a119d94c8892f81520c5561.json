    "description": "Anything can happen; everything is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist; on a slight groundwork of reality, imagination spins and weaves new patterns… The characters are split, double, and multiply… But a single consciousness holds sway over them all- that of the dreamer. Sleep, the liberator, often appears as a torturer, but when the pain is at its worst, the sufferer awakes- and is thus reconciled with reality. For however agonizing real life may be, at this moment, compared with the tormenting dream, it is a joy.\n\nThoughts on why we dress up in costumes, why we dream of being totally anonymous, invisible almost to the point where we erase our name so we can be totally free",
