    "description": "MY (Yulia Mamontova), Almond. Phyllis memory, 2020, Encaustic on wood panel, natural beeswax, resin, color pigments, 47”х 35”.\n\nThis artwork appeared after reading the story of a girl named Phyllis. A girl Phyllis lived In ancient Greece and was in love with Demophon. Phyllis could not survive long separation and turned into a dry tree. Returning to his homeland, Demophon hugged a dried tree and cried relentlessly, watering the branches with tears. Many days and nights, grieving for his beloved, he squeezed a lifeless trunk in the arms. Once the gods of Olympus took pity for Demophon, but Hades did not release Phyllis from the afterlife. And then the tree came to life, leaves dissolved on it and flowers bloomed. The sweet aroma differed from flowers, but with a light mustard, as a memory of love and separation of Phyllis and Demophon.",
