    "description": "All the values ​​symbolized by THEMIS, the god of justice, are lacking in cases of violence against women, especially in third world countries. This is the poster frame of my underwater photography exhibition (13 frames), prepared as the MIRROR series and the subject of which is to raise awareness against violence against women. Especially the position of the scales and the tie, the band on the eyes being in the mouth, and the trapezoidal shape of the sharp sword explain the situation more clearly. This project is the first social responsibility project published by the world underwater confederation (CMAS). This collection has been exhibited in many cities.\nModel: Alena Konecna. Freediving world champion and record holder. Color calibration only.\nThere is no collage or manipulation in the photos.\n11811 x 16535\n\nYou can get more information about the project from the link below.\n\nhttps://www.cmas.org/news/cmas-apnea-social-projects-the-mirror",
