    "description": "Mundane Archaeology. Objects define society and shape human behaviour. In the past years, we have been losing our sense of touch, smell and taste, exchanging experiences on physical spaces for online interactions and transactions. In a near possible future full of nonsense commodities, big machinery productions, and an amazonistic landscape, there is the urge to encapsulate some of those elements that will explain the story of today ÃÅs society. Not as a lineal story but more as a palimpsest of material memories. Having as references the ornaments made by humans, romans, or greeks as found on buildings. Goddesses, animals as still lives of contemporary society.",
