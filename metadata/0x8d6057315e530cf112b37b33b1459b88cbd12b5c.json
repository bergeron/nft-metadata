    "description": "Autonoë : A jovian Moon,\n\nThings about space and astronomy have always fascinated me. The other day I was reading about Jupiter- how huge it is and has most number of moons in our solar system, and it became my inspiration for this artwork. The hues it exhibited got me overwhelmed with its mystic beauty. A thing so mighty and giant standing in all its humbleness, taught me so much about humility with all its simplicity.\n \nOnly to realise how small we are, we must go really high. Keeping this in mind, I have tried to portray the enormity of this planet through one of its moons in my own style.",
