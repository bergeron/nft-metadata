    "description": "Elif in his free time after school. He also helps his family on weekends.\n\nApples are collected with great care and placed in boxes that are ready for sale. This job is very difficult for Elif.\n\nHe’s a kid, so it’s difficult for him to lift heavy crates.\n\nI learned and photographed both Elif's life and the apple harvest.\n\nAgricultural work is difficult in Anatolia, but making money by working is a great source of happiness.",
