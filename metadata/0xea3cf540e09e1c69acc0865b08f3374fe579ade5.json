    "description": "This artwork was created for the exhibition \"I am...\" powered by Gxrls Revolution and Jean-Michel Pailhon.\n\nThrough her work Sophia uses virtual reality and 3D simulation in order to create speculative narratives of past or future naturecultures of the Chtulucene. \n\n'I am Here or Where Am I' takes the ‘I’ as a collective identity with our environment to engage into a conscience-changing experience .",
