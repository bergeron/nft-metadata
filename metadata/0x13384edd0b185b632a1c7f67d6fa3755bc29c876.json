    "description": "This work of art is the work of Iranian artist Awad Ali Mohajer, which is mixed with digital art.\nThere is no physical version of this work in the world, and this is the only version of this work mixed with handicrafts and digital art.\nThis art is originally known as the art of seven-color tiles in Iran.\nAnd many people have known this art in the city of Isfahan in Iran.\nBut this is the work of an Iranian artist from Tehran who worked in Tehran for more than 50 years.\nMany works of this artist have been installed throughout Iran and some parts of the world.\nIn fact, this Iranian artist is my father and I am proud of him.\nI created the digital version of this artwork on August 17, 2005.",
