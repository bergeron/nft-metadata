    "description": "Sarducciâ€™s debut collection, \"FAKE ID\" is a collaborative project alongside STILLZ, that aims to poke fun at fraudulent identification culture in the USA. All names, addresses, and personal information have been digitally manipulated to help create a new fictional entity. Throughout the process, each ID goes through several layers of alterations to ensure a result from the depths of the uncanny valley. The collection will begin with all 50 states and are set to release in alphabetical order.\n\n1/1",
