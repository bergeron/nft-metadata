    "description": "Deep within the heart of the District, tensions are high as two competing factions vie for territory. The Neon Pizza crew has had the upper hand for years satisfying thousands of customers every day with their delicious pizza. Just blocks away, the Fast & Fresh squad plots their takeover. After many attempts, diplomacy has failed and a lone agent from the Fast & Fresh squad has been dispatched to eliminate the competition at all costs.\n\nInspired by the Neon District Universe. This historic moment captures the events that set in motion the Great Pizza Wars ultimately wreaking the most intensely violent and chaotic epoch the District has ever seen.\n\nVisuals by miezekatze and audio by GlitchBlack.",
