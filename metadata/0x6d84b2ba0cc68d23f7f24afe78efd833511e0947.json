    "description": "'Blackhole' is a collection of visual metaphors inspired by themes such as  transformation, dispersion of time, interdimensional presence and archetypal symbols. It is also Dynamic blockchain art creation,  merging two different types of smart contract designs: the utility token named $blackhole in conjunction with a complex set of audiovisual surreal dreamscapes. The inner properties and visuals are reacting to the way collectors make use of the $blackhole token, evolving from minimalistic geometric sculptures in desert landscapes towards the apparition of eerie cosmic visions.The digital artworks are organized around 3 main symbols: the horse, the bird and the orb.Each of them has several stages which are corresponding to the amount of $blackhole that is assigned to them, the ultimate stage being a unique depiction of a world under the sign of a mysterious dark celestial body. created by Mihai Grecu, smart contract design by @smartcontrart",
