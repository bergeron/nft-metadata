    "description": "I have the ability/scope to act as I please thanks to technology. Aunty Liberty is a work I made by combining graffiti and 3D. Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's statue of liberty is an international emblem of freedom. I was able to make this piece through Augmented Reality, I believe this piece portrays even greater freedom from oppressive limits imposed by authorities. \n",
