    "description": "This is the first work of the collection \"CARE OF\".\n\nIt is about physical and emotional connection, a sense of safeness and sense of gratefulness.\n\nAll of us, unwittingly, turn out to be connected to each other. Connected by common pain and common love. \nAnd all I am talking about trough this work - is about taking care of yourself, teaching of how to love yourself.\n\n",
