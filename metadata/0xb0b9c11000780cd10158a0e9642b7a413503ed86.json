    "name": "The Witch Behind the Mirror",
    "description": "I walked through the door, and it slammed shut behind me.\nA dark, long hallway with hundreds of mirrors on both sides.\nI went to the first mirror and got goosebumps from what I saw.\nShe looked at me through the glass. \nHer black eyes pierced through me, making me squirm with fear.\nBehind her was an old crypt, and she was standing right in front of the mirror, watching with unblinking eyes.\nTrying not to look into her eyes, I glanced at her bare breasts and the torn fabric of her dress not covering her nipples...\nShe was creepy, but so attractive at the same time. It was like she was luring me with her gaze. I was ready to go through the mirror in spite of my fear.\nThe clammy fear and burning desire struggled inside me, but I took a few steps forward.\nI think I saw a slight smirk on her face.\n\nNow I am her slave... \n",
