    "description": "Spesh is looking for his best friend throughout Coolman's Universe. To travel through this universe, Spesh uses a surfboard and a compass. This compass is no ordinary compass. Not only does this compass point Spesh in the right direction to find his friend, it also tracks the path that Spesh's friend has taken. As Spesh follows his compass (while surfing Coolman's Universe), he finds himself exploring worlds that he's never experienced.",
