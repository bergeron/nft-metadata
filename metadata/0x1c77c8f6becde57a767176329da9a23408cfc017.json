    "description": "This 1/1 artwork, named Tenet belongs to the Thoughts series. This artwork encapsulates the collective vision toward each other. Our identity of being human is derived from each other and rather ourselves. \n\nWe identify ourselves and give others labels for differentiation. The collective is having an individualistic identity, and individuals are bringing their vision. This perceived identity mechanism derived from the collective to the individual and vice versa gave birth to empathy. Empathy connects us; this is the tenet of our identity.\n",
