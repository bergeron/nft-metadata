    "description": "'Adversity gives rise to resilience'\n\nDisaster struck Ely Cathedral on 13 February 1322, when the Norman central tower collapsed. Unable to restore to its original state due to weak foundations, firmer foundations were found further out from the original pillars, and from this evolved the idea of building an octagon surmounted by a lantern. \n\nTo avoid the pillars from collapsing inwards, the octagonal stone tower has eight internal arches, each supporting an amazing timber fan-vaulted roof. The roof is made of a complex wooden structure covered in lead weighing 400 tons. This masterpiece of medieval engineering took 18 years to build and has stood for centuries.\n\nToday, the Octagon Tower stands as a symbol of strength and resilience, reminding us that even in the face of challenges, it is possible to create something beautiful and enduring.\"",
