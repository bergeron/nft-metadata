    "name": "Sex Workers Are Sacred",
    "description": "Using intricate strokes of a pencil and a simplistic yet bold color palette, Sex Workers Are Sacred honors the memory of the six Asian women who lost their lives in the Atlanta Spa Shootings on March 16, 2021.\n\nIn the face of adversity, sex workers are creative, brilliant and won't take your shit. They invent and practice community care; sex education; safety & consent; polyamory; trans, queer, disabled, and decarceral feminisms; art; and business models. \n\nSex workers are an essential fabric of our communities â€” and you probably don't even know it.\n\nSex workers are sacred.\nAsian sex workers are sacred.\nNothing less.",
