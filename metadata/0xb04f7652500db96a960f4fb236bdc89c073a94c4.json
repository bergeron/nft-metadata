    "description": "A colorful heart was living in the jungle, dark, wet, full of life. The moon gave it a light wink, a kiss, a whisper of magic. The heart is brave, passionate, the heart is strong and loves its colors.\n\nMéxico is the country of passion, of braveness, of colors. \nAccording to SIC (by its spanish acronym Sistema de Información Cultural) México has 71 indigenous groups with les tan 130,000,000 of population in total. Sadly, indigenous people mostly are marginalized and their lands are invaded and operated by international companies (Not mexican). The level of social and economical inequality are incredibly big, our government allows this just because of the money $$. \nWe will never forget our origin, our blood, our colors. We will never stop fighting, we are warriors.",
