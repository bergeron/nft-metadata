    "description": "Dimetrodon is a classic of the « prehistoric » bestiary, but it’s not a dinosaur despite its unique appearance. Indeed this animal lived long before the appearance of the first dinosaurs at the end of the primary era (300M years ago) and it is not the ancestor.\n\nThe group belonging: the Plycosaurians are close to the origin of the mammals of which we got an origin touch too.\n\nThis specimen comes from Texas and was found in river deposits.\n\nThese animals are known from fossils in North America and Europe; they intrigued palaeontologists since their discovery at the end of the 19th century and have since aroused the admiration of all.\n\nThe processes of their dorsal vertebrae form a sort of ridges on the back, a skin blade connecting them, they are the Pangea « punks », the single continent at the time, this blade is often interpreted as a thermal regulator, the dimetrodons then lived in hot and arid areas.\n\nOnly around 10-20 of those specimens have ever been found yet. This one holds 70% of the original bones, which makes it one of the most unique of its kind to date.\n\n*The specimen linked with this NFT is the one represented in the attached pitcure.",
