    "description": "Border Film Project (Proyecto Fotográfico de Frontera) is an art project aimed at humanizing the issue of immigration between the United States and Mexico from two perspectives: undocumented migrants crossing the border and Minutemen volunteers trying to stop them. Launched in 2005 by Rudy Adler, Victoria Criado, and Brett Huneycutt, the project involved distributing hundreds of disposable cameras to both groups on opposite sides of the border. Participants were asked to capture their experiences and return the cameras to the project organizers. The resulting photographs were showcased in art galleries across the U.S. and Mexico and were also published in a book by Harry N. Abrams.\n\nCopyright: © 2005 Border Film Project.
