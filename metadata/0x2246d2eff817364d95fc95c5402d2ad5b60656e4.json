    "description": "Photo taken on the famous \"les planches\" of Trouville-sur-mer in Normandy (France), in February 2011\n\nIt was very cold, with an icy wind.\nMy little girl was protected in her hooded coat. She put on the passenger hat, over her hood.\nAnd that was it.\n\nPhotograph : 10368x6912 pixels, 300 DPI, JPEG\n\n\n\nThe passenger is an ode to contemplation.\nThe original idea is to integrate a character into a landscape photograph.\n\nThe passenger is not a ghost.\nThe passenger is not threatening.\nThe passenger is inside us.\nBut you are free to see the passenger as you wish...\n\nEach photograph is taken in long exposure, without any photomontage.\n\n« The passenger » is my first series, exploring the crossroads of landscape photography, portrait, and dreamlike photography.
