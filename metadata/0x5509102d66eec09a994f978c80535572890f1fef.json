    "description": "3 miles above NYC in an open-door helicopter has never been done before. So the images that came from this flight are all new to me as well as new to viewer.  This level of awe and wonder is a precious thing for a creator, and I hope that it translates in the imagery.  Here is a north (top of frame) to south view of the island of Manhattan and surrounding environs.  The avenues are pronounced in this orientation, as well as the shadows of the skyline on the Hudson River.  The first of 2 editions in the Sky Scraper series.  ",
