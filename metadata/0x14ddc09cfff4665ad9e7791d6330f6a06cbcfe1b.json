    "description": "From the \"Cemetery\" Collection\nDisplayed in Etemad Gallery, Tehran, Iran\nFall 2016\nPhysical 3-Edition sold\n\nKhatoon goes to the desert part-time and helps her Husband. She is a citizen of Hormuz Island. Khatun goes to the desert and spreads the fish on the ground, scrambles them to dry in the sun every morning. To protect her beauty from sun Khatun covers her face with a burqa while working.\n\nCEMETERY\nOne: People dry out the fish! With wet bodies covered in sweat, sun-burnt faces and dried lips, hands wounded with fish thorn, surrounded by flies, in the midst of the putrid wind, They dry out the fish.\n\nTwo: Miracle is flowing. The feast is being held. The guests have swum thousands of miles to reach their destination, A Kaaba of meat and blood: The Mankind! They spin around it and recite words of prayer and dance until they reach that pure moment. The hosts, the guardians of the sea and the earth, dressed in Elias and Khizar, Slowly fade among the fish. The fish make the people vanish!",
