    "description": "“Occupied” is the story of alternative living in Berlin, Germany. It is an exploration of living arrangements that defy societal and economical norms, and stray from the masses. A seeking to understand what drives those who live alternatively, the work looks into the lives of alternative dwellers in an effort to explore daily life, and the minds of those people. \n\nThe work seeks to answer the questions, “What is home?” and “Why do you live here?”\nI spent time at squats and occupied lands, in communities with hippies, punks, anarchists,\ncircus performers and people who many would consider poor or homeless, trying to understand what motivates so many to live alternatively. The work seeks to answer the questions, “What is home?” and “Why do you live here?”\n\nAs the divide between rich and poor\nsteadily continues to grow, and climate change becomes rapidly more obvious, aiming to live a life of sustainability is the best and only option we have to make the planet better for everyone.
