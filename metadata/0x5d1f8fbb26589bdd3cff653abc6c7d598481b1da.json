    "description": "\"Chicory\" is a unique 3D piece. At a time when the biggest laboratories are ready to do anything to get rich, a last scientist is ready to do anything to perpetuate the love he has for his last plant, his chicory. He protects her, makes her grow in his little laboratory.\n\nThis piece aims to show the cinematographic aspect and the creativity that is contained in us in order to convey the creative process that I went through.",
