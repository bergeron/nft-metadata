    "description": "Daponmati. \nShe is a character who belongs to medieval Assamese society. A fearless and determined woman with eyes full of hope and a kind soul. Her hair is like the monsoon river. Her dance could shake the very foundation of the world and bring forth spring mid-winter. Sometimes she graces the world with a quiet smile and her rare laughter could silence storms.",
