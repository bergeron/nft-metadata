    "description": "The story is about 1000 people from the planet Pixel, who call themselves 'BOOM GUYS'. They came to Earth for a trip, but their planet's only spaceship was damaged and they couldn't go back, so they settled on Earth. Surprisingly, they even married and had children with Earthlings, resulting in babies who looked like a mix of both Earthlings and BOOM GUYS!",
