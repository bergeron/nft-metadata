    "description": "Asian architecture has shown itself as a visual study of the countryâ€™s culture and people. The Phoenix Media Center is more than an example of architecture genius, but one of lights and creativity that stood out from all the others. From the way the light filters through the glass to the reflections and shadows, this center is a marvel of Asian art and functionality in one.",
