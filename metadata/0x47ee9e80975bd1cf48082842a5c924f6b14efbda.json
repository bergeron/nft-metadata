    "description": "Unlike real machines the bachelor machine appears as an impossible, useless, delirious machine. \nIt may consist of a single peculiar and unknown machine or of an heteroclite assemblage of pieces and fragments of anything. \nThe bachelor machine has no reason for existing in itself, it’s a semblance of machinery governed by the mental laws of subjectivity that adopts certain mechanical and/or organic forms in order to produce a movement of the mind. \nIt’s a pataphysical machine.\n\nAI + PS\nPNG 4400 x 5000 px\n1/1 Edition \nExplosante-Fixe, 2023",
