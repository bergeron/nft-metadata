    "description": "My young grandpa took this photo in 1985. \n\nIt is at the Diego Vel√°zquez museum.  In 1511 he led the successful conquest and colonization of Cuba.\n\nMy grandpa and the model hid from the museum guards, sneaked to the top floor, and took this photo. \n\nShe dared, pulled her dress down, and her body contrasted beautifully with the lights.",
