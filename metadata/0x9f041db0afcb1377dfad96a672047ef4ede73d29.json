    "description": "Bicycle is an integral part of life and culture of Yazd people, especially old men. They even use it to move goods.\nWhen riding a bicycle, people have used “KHORJIN” (saddlebags) to easily move things and goods they need. KHORJIN is a kind of bag with a special type of cloth. Spun wool was usually used to make it. KHORJIN includes two large pockets. The location of KHORJIN is in the back part of the bike.\nPixel: 5471*3548\nLocation: Iran-Yazd\nYear:2023",
