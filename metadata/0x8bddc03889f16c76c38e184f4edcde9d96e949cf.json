    "description": "This image was taken in Ciucas Mountains - Romania in the winter of 2016. Nature unleashed in Ciucas Mountains. At a time when everyone was in the house, I was sitting in the woods facing winds exceeding 80 km / h. It was so spectacular, nature is a good drawer.\n\nIt's a unique image, it's like a pencil drawing, but it's still a digital photograph. This image shows me a real winter scene in which you seem to feel the cold catch you and enter your bones, but at the same time it gives me a feeling of calm. It's a weird feeling.\n\nThe image was awarded at different international photo competitions, such as ILPOTY, IPA,  EPSON PANO AWARDS, TRANSNATURA, MILVUS, etc.\n\n***This NFT comes with a 1 meter physical print for the first owner of this piece. The image is UV printed directly on acrylic glass and is mounted on aluminum plate, ensuring stability and an elegant look.\n\nThis image is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity and will be a 1/1 limited edition print.\n",
