    "description": "I started making music in my childhood bedroom when it was just me and a cracked version of logic. Back then, I released about a song a week on SoundCloud, but after signing with a label, I had to distribute my creativity between creating a brand and making music. I've got great people around me helping me get back to the process I fell in love with; conceptualizing, recording, and just putting it out there. \n\nThe eeriness flows from those intrusive thoughts, you know, the ones that hit you late at night and send you in a never-ending loop. Finding something to hold onto, whatever that may be brings you back to the reality that you are in control of how you deal with shit. Being able to embrace the ebb and flow of making music in a digital world.\n\n“HOLD ON” started with this gritty guitar riff which got me thinking about my experience in the cycle of highs and lows in the music industry. We wanted this darker tone with dryer vocals but to also have fun with it. When the lyrics started flowing, it created this dance between the lyrics guiding the beat and the beat driving the lyrics.
