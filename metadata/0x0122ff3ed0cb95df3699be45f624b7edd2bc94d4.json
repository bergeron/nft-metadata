    "description": "Ethereum Blue Red is one of over 100 works that I made during the darkest days of Lockdown. During this time I was cut off from my normal subjects, people and places. Everything seemed very grey during lockdown, so much so I began to crave colour. I felt the need to create something so I embarked on a new series of colourful still lives called Lockdown Blockchain. These works were made in my studio in South London and are a representation of what I imagine the blockchain to look like. \n",
