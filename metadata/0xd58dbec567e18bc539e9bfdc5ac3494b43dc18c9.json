    "description": "Until the 18th century, a bouquet of flowers, as a rule, symbolized the frailty of life, because earthly joys are as fleeting as the beauty of a flower. In the 21st century, people are more and more interested in biohacking, how to increase life expectancy, so I wanted to extend the life of all living things by changing materials. Contrary to the basic idea of Dutch still lifes. \"Still-life\" has turned into a still-long-life in my works.\n\nSymbolism.\nThere is robotics in this work, a reference to the development of technology in everyday life. Robot hands picking a bouquet symbolize the speed and accuracy of actions without mistakes inherent in a person.\n..\nsequel available to collector",
