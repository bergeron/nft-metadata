    "description": "In Hindu mythology, Ma Saraswati is considered the queen of art who sits on a white lotus. With Veena in her hands, she imparts wisdom, knowledge, music, art, and speech equally to all, be it a child or a sage. She introduced different colours in the world by putting her foot on Earth. The advent of truth was brought by her as she separated falsehood from reality/truth, just like the swan who separated water and drank only pure milk. Jai Ma Saraswati! \nAdobe photoshop-PC with graphic pad\n\n** Non-Animated High-resolution version is available for collectors; contact the artist via DM. \n** Music/Vocals by Samarth Saxena, recorded in studios with pro musicians, exclusive to the Rebel Club's Diwali Collab, with 15+ artists. \n\nLicences\n* Artwork: CC BY-SA\n* Audio: CC-BY-NC-SA\n",
