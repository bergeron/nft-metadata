    "description": "My very first NFT 'Capricorn AF' is a digital edit and animation of my traditional painting 'Capricorn'\nThe Capricorn sign is represented as half goat, half fish. A combination of earth and water, these sea goats are grounded and practical while also creative and sensitive. \nThis original painting and this digital version were created for all Capricorns everywhere. A message of love and a reminder to get out of our heads sometimes.  We can achieve our goals and dreams with our headstrong determination but not to forget to go with the flow like the sea creatures we are.  \n\nA 24x24\" one of a kind canvas print of Capricorn AF will be included in the sale of this 1/1 NFT.",
