    "description": "Subject. Florals\nDimensions. 3744x4992\nEdition. 1/1\n\nArtwork Details || This piece was produced using a photographic method called macro photography. This consists of using lenses to magnify and photograph extremely small objects in an attempt to cast light onto a world that would otherwise be too small to see. This method also creates a sense of fluidity within the photographs, which is used to help blur the lines between a photograph and a painting.\n\nWith this work, strict caution is used to keep the images as natural as they were when they were photographed. They are shot digitally and then adjustments are made only to the digital negative itself, no further. The photos are never brought out of their raw state and into any sort of image editing program such as Photoshop. This method tells much more into what was originally captured photographically versus what could have been manipulated digitally, and also adds to the viewers experience and to the honesty of the photos themselves.",
