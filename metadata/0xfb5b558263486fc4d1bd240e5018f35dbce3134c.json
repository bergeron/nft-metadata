    "description": "The Amur Leopard or Far Eastern Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is one of the eight subspecies of leopard. As recently as the 1970s, their population in the wild had dwindled to fewer than 30 individuals, making the Amur leopard is one of the worldâ€™s most endangered big cats. It is only found in the Russian Far East and North East China and the latest population census taken in 2020 suggests there are now around 100 individuals in the wild.",
