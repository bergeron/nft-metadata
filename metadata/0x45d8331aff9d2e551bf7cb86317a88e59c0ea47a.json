    "description": "With commitment to a craft comes care and joy in what is being made. Once the satisfaction of creating sets in, it is not easy to let go of. In an effort to hold on to this feeling the urge to keep making is conceived. As the journey of building up the craft continues, the skills accumulated are sharpened and with this the final product becomes stronger and closer to the ideal in mind. After committing to the vision for long enough, a point is reached where the artistry in idea form catches up with the techniques that have been developed and this is a truly powerful combination. It’s almost as if anything that is thought of can be created, it’s like flirting with creation.",
