    "description": "This photograph always reminds me of my genesis as a street photographer and one of my works that gave me a limelight amidst top photographers. \n\nHaving it as my first ever edition on this blockchain makes it even more a beautiful occurrence.\n\nThe image shows a part of the 'Panseke Pedestrian Bridge' in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria (which happens to be my state of origin). The bridge is the longest pedestrian bridge in the Sub-Saharan Africa and was commissioned in 2018 by the then State Government.\n\nOften called the 'Bridge of Confusion' or 'Octopus' because of many turns on it that makes people to get lost easily.\n\nThis pieces every time reminds me of my humble beginning of searching the street and making the mundane moments to be beautifully and meaningfully captured - This has always been the core value for me as a street photographer.\n\nI love the alignments of the cars, the colours, the people, the beautiful scenery, and every part of the photograph and I intend to share this beauty with prospective holders.",
