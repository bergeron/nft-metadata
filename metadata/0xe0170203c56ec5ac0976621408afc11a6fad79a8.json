    "description": "The genesis project from me, Hunter Orrell.  Only 555 tokens exist.  Each token is unique and randomly generated at mint and stored on-chain.  5555 was influenced by many different naturally occurring patterns, as well as, the concept of 2D and 3D shape interaction causing depth of field.  Development for 5555 began in March of 2021 inspired by my past doodles and Processing projects alongside the idea of Art Blocks.  Originally a project that planned to have a supply of 5555, the name was kept as a nod to the character from Veefriends, 5555 Fan. Holders of 5555 will receive special benefits. Token IDs #0-30 were originally owned by Hunter Orrell.",
