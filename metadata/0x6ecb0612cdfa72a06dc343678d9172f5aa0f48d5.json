    "name": "Surreal Light",
    "description": "Somewhere in Oregon, I came around the bend and my jaw dropped as I looked outside the car window into what seemed like another world of surrealism.\n\nThe golden light that bounced off the plants of Earth.  The rock formations in the distance which added depth to the horizon of green sea.   The bird effortlessly soaring through the air.  The way this sight gave me feelings of freedom, creativity, wonder and gratitude.\n\nI captured this on only the second day of my trip and I still cannot stop thinking about this particular area & window of time where everything just seemed to align.",
