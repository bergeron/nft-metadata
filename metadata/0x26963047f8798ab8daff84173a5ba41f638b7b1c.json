    "description": "\" Breathe in the good.\nHold onto hope.\nWhen everyone’s gone\nAnd you’re left holding pieces\nOf what you thought was something but\nIs actually nothing\nat all;\nHas never been anything\nat all;\nBlind dysphoria is all that’s left.\nHeartbeats grow faint.\nWill drifts into the abyss of loneliness profound.\nBut I will hold onto hope.\nI will breathe in the good.\nFor a little while longer \"\n\n--Marduk Knight",
