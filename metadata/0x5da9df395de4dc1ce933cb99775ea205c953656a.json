    "description": "In the midst of an open field, a woman runs with a sense of purpose, her movements guided by an unseen force. She moves with fluid grace, her hair and dress flowing behind her as if carried by the wind. There is an air of mystery about her, as if she is running towards something unknown or away from something unseen. But despite this, her movements are imbued with a sense of beauty and elegance that is impossible to ignore. It is as if the wind itself is guiding her, carrying her towards a place of hidden significance. As she runs, the world around her seems to shift and change, as if caught in the wake of her movements. And then, with a final burst of speed, she disappears over the horizon, leaving behind a sense of awe and wonder that will linger long after she is gone.\n\n2023 FARRAH CARBONELL",
