    "description": "This art is based on the scenery I saw when I visited Kyushu before. It was a trip many years ago, but I missed it and remembered it as if it was yesterday, so I drew it so that I wouldn't forget it.\n\nThe situation is that it is not easy to travel now.\nI drew it with the desire to visit this place again someday.",
