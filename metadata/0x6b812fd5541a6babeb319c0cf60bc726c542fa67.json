    "description": "The JR Tadami Line, which runs through the Tadami River connecting Fukushima and Niigata prefectures in Japan, is known as a beautiful local line. Among them, the \"First Tadami River Bridge\" is one of the most representative views of the Tadami Line, and the scenery of the magnificent Tadami River valley and the surrounding mountains attracts many people throughout the four seasons. The scenery covered with snow in winter is especially fantastic, and it is a popular spot for many photographers to take pictures here.\n\nHowever, I wanted to take pictures that were different from others. Since most of the photos were taken during the day when it was light, I decided to take a photo before dawn.\n\nIt was much darker than I expected, making it very difficult to take pictures. After reviewing the equipment and settings, I finally got this photo after several passes. I will never forget the joy of taking this photo.\n\nThis photo was awarded by 1x.com.\nhttps://1x.com/photo/2193887",
