    "description": "\"An American desert may be cynically described as an arid zone with a four-lane highway slapped down in the middle of it. That is, nowadays, the way in which American deserts are usually seen—that legendary, hallucinating view through the windshield of an endless ribbon of blacktop or smeared concrete being devoured somewhere under the front of the car and—in the rear view mirror—being discharged out back.\" - Reyner Banham\n\nThese scenes of America deserta were inspired by the children’s book, The Desert Is Theirs, by Byrd Baylor. A story about adaptation and interconnectedness within the unstandardized geography of the American desert. ",
