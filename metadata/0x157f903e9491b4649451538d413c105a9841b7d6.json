    "description": "Everything was meant to be different as well as the description of this collection.\nI was going to tell you about the beauty of the human body and nature.But, due to whatâ€™s happening in our country - Ukraine, it will be the way it is.\n\nI have eventually decided to upload this collection that we have been working on the whole month while I have such an opportunity, stuck at home and not able to go outside. 50% of the earnings will go to the creator who has been working for a month on animating my photos and I feel that the result is absolutely magical. These animations with such music take me far away from all the horror that is going on right now.\n\nFrom the rest of earnings, I would like to support our country during these hard times. Specifically, I want to support animal rescues that are under extra pressure now as the war also means lots of abandoned animals on the streets and no support for shelters. I would like to thank you all for all the support that Ukrainians get from you!",
