    "description": "This image is of a Sadhu from the famous Kumbh Mela . He is highly temperamental and I could take the image only after trying for 4 days. Light was dimming and there was lot of crowd eager to click him. I knew I had little time. I just asked him to light the fire and ignite his \"chillum\". My first shot was the final shot. Yellow fire creates lovely contrast  with the blue painted face.\nIt has been published and awarded by Nat Geo. \n\nArtist: Jassi Oberai\nEdition: 1/1\nCollection Name: Faces Of India I\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
