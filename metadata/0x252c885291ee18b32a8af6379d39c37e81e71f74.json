    "description": "In April of 2020, separated by an ocean and 3000 miles, both of us went into self-isolation. Physically, of course -- like everyone else. But also musically.\n\nTurning inwards, we scoured the Refs instrumental vault for our most menacing, introverted and brooding soundscapes -- and proceeded to write 12 songs in 12 days. 2 years later, we offer up our debut album, \"New Religion\".\n\nWe wrote the title track for this album so quickly that we’re still having trouble wrapping our minds around what it means. This was an exercise in getting the hidden contents of our brain’s id out in recorded form.\n\nThe animated image we chose for artwork is a taste of an unreleased \"New Religion\" themed collectable project. Owners of our sound.xyz NFTs will get advanced access to the mint.",
