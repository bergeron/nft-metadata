    "description": "A series of 12 photographs taken with my Iphone camera when I am out running. \nI run every few days, mostly on trails on the South Downs Way in the UK. \nRunning is great for my physical wellbeing and certainly clears my mind of the day to day stuff. \nI like to take photos along the way, often near a stile or a gate - it is a great way to catch my breath and take a moment to observe the landscape and take in the natural beauty of our fabulous country.  \nThanks for looking at my photographs which I minted using manifold smart contract.  \n",
