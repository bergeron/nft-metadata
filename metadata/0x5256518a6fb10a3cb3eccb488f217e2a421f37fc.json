    "description": "Generations of my family have grown up roaming this set of train tracks. Yes, train tracks are not the safest place to grow up, regardless it was a great place to learn. Maybe I was raised a bit differently, but for my family and I, this is a place that fills us with joy, peace, and nostalgia.\n\nI don't remember a summer growing up when I didn't visit these tracks while at the lake with my family. We've spent hours exploring and creating memories on these tracks. Memories that are hard to put into words, but easily captured in a photo.\n\nAs I grew older this place became my canvas to learn about photography and I will always be rooted to it for that reason.\n\nLast Mother's Day I captured the essence of what this place means to my mom and I in a single image.\n\nThis Mother's Day, I've released this genesis piece on foundation as gift to my mom. She has always been the strongest supporter of my photography and this place means as much to her as it does to me.\n\nLove You Mom.\nKeats",
