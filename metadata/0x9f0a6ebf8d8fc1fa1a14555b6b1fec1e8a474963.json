    "description": "Growing up I have always dreamed of travelling to Hawaii to see all the magic the islands have to offer. Itâ€™s always seemed like such a distant world of its own, full of wonder. I was so stoked when the opportunity came to visit. My entire time spent in Maui was filled with excitement and beautiful views. The island and the people give off an energy I have never felt. The adventure is endless through the diverse landscapes of deserts, mountains, volcanoes, jungles, and vast ocean waters. One of my favourite days there was spent hiking deep in the jungle and finding this oceanside oasis. This place was paradise, surrounded by lush greenery as the sounds of the birds and ocean waves filled the air. When I took to the sky above and looked down, the beauty of this scene was truly revealed. Hope you enjoy and thanks for looking!",
