    "description": "Grisham Genesis:\n\nHe is known in every corner of the metaverse as a true behemoth. When he was younger, his parents tragically were burned in the ethereal war with the Order of Simians (OS). They stood and fought in what would end up being doomsday on his homeserver. Before the apocalyptic battle, his parents left him an heirloom, the katana of his people, to carry with him on his escape. With essentially no training, and the loss of his family and his people, Grisham had to create a new world for himself, a better one.\n\nHe spent years on a desolate sandbox, spending every waking moment training with his peopleâ€™s weapon, and harnessing his powers. After a couple decades, he felt he was ready to go out and change the metaverse, making sure no child would ever be left an orphan at the hands of evil. Once he had rejoined ape society, his mission was underway. He would seek out others who thought the same way, that evil and good are two made up words to make apes feel safer in a dark reality. He wanted society to see evil and good are intertwined, and it is our individual choices that make the metaverse a good or bad place.",
