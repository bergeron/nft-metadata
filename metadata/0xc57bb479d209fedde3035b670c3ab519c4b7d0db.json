    "description": "This artwork is a unique NFT, that brought 3D life to a still image. ‘CELED’, made in 2022 was about an observation of extant affairs, where despite all the chaos and distress that is being experienced by the society, our leaders are perhaps more focused on their own vanity than providing leadership. Hence the figure of ‘Liberty Leading the People’ with the French Tricolour has been replaced by ‘Celebrity’ and the Tricolour replaced by a selfie.\nThe art piece is an amalgam of elements of ‘Liberty Leading the People’ by Eugene Delacroix from 1830 and ‘The Wreck of the Medusa’ by Theodore Gericault from 1818. ‘CELED’ has also updated the rendering of the ‘people’ to include the iconic images of the ‘gilet jaunes’ from the protests in Paris and other parts of France running from 2018 to current times.\n\n",
