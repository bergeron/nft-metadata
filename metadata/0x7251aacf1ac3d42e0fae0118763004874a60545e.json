Presence painting n°55 is the Matrix of FLXP#1. It is a large painting 78.7in x 66.9in made during the presence painting performance and staged in James Arax’s studio in Paris in 2011. The particularity of the performance is that paintings are all made in the presence of a person. I like this painting because the model kept moving around me as I painted. The girl was tall, cute and fluid, she walked and danced. She wore a blue, glitter top and Louboutin heels.\n\nYou can find below the links to the 7 collections of NFTs of OpenFlowingXP Project and create families of NFTs that extend the artistic performance.\n\nhttps://rarible/ofxp1\nhttps://rarible/ofxp2\nhttps://rarible/fpz\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/ofxp3\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/ofxp4\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/ofxp5\nhttps://foundation.app/flxp",
