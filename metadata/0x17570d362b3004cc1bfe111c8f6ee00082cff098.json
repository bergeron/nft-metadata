    "description": "\"Cloudy day at beach\"\n\nIn this work i try to represent the suffocating weight of loneliness. For example the gray clouds, which fill much of the frame.\n\nBut also the fact that we are not completely alone, as the poem says: \"No person is an island; the death of anyone affects me, because i am united with all humanity.\" \nAs cold and gray as the world seemed, there will always be those willing to give us a hand\n\n\nOtherwise why would the girl be posing, who would she pose for? she is posing for you my friend.\n\nI hope you like it",
