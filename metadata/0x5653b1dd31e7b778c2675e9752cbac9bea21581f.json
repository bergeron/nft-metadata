    "description": "I can't tell you how old I was when I figured out I was different from most people because it feels like I always felt that way, unusual. I've experienced a tremendous amount of agony in my childhood and most days feels like I'm still living in my past. a person's mindset is one of the strongest things a human can build. I see the world with a grim pair of eyes, I struggle to keep my faith most days. depression gets in the way of my confidence, some days I feel like God while what seems like most days, I feel like there's no point in going.  those days are the silent and long nights where I'm drowning in my sorrow, wondering if I even want to try again.. tomorrow. \n\n\n\n3D, glitch, photoshop.",
