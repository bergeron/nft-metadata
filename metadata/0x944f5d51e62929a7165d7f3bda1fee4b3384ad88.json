    "description": "It had been almost 2 years since I had moved away from fashion photography. 2 years that I was trying to define MY photography. The one that gets me out of bed in the morning, that stops time for me. Some keywords had come out over time with images and envy: Women, colors, details, shadows, lines, curves, light.\n\nWhen I did this shooting, everything came naturally. I was brimming with envies. « I want to play with you and with autumn colors, those primary colors, yellow, red, green, and with shadows ». I wanted to rule out all the artifices to get to the essence. That was my mindset.\n\nAnd suddenly, this happened. I was looking for the next location, I turned around, and discovered her, just like that, redoing her makeup. Her face was enlightened by the mirror,  I stopped breathing, took the picture before she made any moves. This brief moment offered me the most surprising and beautiful picture of this shooting already very special to me.\n\nThis stolen moment crystalized MY photography.",
