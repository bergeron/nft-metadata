    "description": "Many will say, it's just a myth!\n\nBig corporations and MSM led by them will and are trying to convince us, that it never happened, to tear off the negative label from it, and while we may enjoy all the benefits of today's Black Fridays, we must never forget the origin.\n\nRegardless of that, whether it happened in that kind of form or not, we must be aware that slavery although on an official level was abolished and prohibited all over the world is still very much alive.\n\nAnd I'm not talking just about our metaphorical slavery in the consumption society \n\nAll over the world, not just the «third world countries« people are enslaved both in a mental and physical way, many are sold and treated as products of consumption.\n\nIt is on us, especially us in the so-called developed countries and us the artists to raise our voices against it! \n\nSTOP all human rights violations, STOP it now!\n\nNFT Size: 3000 x 3060 px I 300dpi \nby @Uzzy - Nov 2022\n",
