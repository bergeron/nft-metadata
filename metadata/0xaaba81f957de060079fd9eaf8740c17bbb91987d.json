    "description": "In 1984, SAP and Co Financial, LLC held a spam-themed office party, but there was some confusion among the employees who mistakenly believed that spam was made of beef. As a result, many of the employees arrived at the party dressed in cow costumes. Despite the misunderstanding, the party went ahead as planned with the break room decked out in spam-inspired decorations, including cans of spam shaped into various designs. The snack line was exceptional and boasted bountiful piles of spam pop drinks and notmeat snacks.\n\nThe group photo shoot captured the employees' enthusiasm and creativity, with the cow-clad attendees striking various poses with cans of spam.",
