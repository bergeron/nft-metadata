    "description": "Blue is a color often associated with sadness, when someone says they are feeling blue, it is safe to assume they need comforting. I actually created a piece centered on this very theme of the color blue and hopelessness last year at a low point in my life as I battled through a depressive episode.\n\nAs I was able to process my feelings of despondency through that piece, I wanted to follow up with this piece because luckily a lot  has changed. With this new piece I take back the narrative of that central blue color scheme and feeling so low, to celebrate my wins.\n\nThis piece was created in 2022. The first collector of this digital piece will receive an exclusive 36” x 27” metal print delivered anywhere in the world.",
