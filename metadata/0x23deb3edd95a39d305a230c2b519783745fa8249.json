    "description": "POWER TULIP element - refers to an advanced level, requires good physical fitness and the ability to stay on the pylon\n\nThe origin of the name of the trick: The gentle curve of the performer's body creates a silhouette like a tilted tulip flower, for which the element got its name\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe trick is performed by pushing the body up with the shoulders. The easiest way to enter the element is to climb the pylon a little, put one hand with an eversion grip up, the other in a spread down (“flag grip”) and push off from the pylon, turning the body up. Another exit option is from the flyby: as soon as your body flies in front of the pylon, you need to put your free hand in a brace and push yourself into the \"Tulip\" by straightening both arms\n\nImportant: The arms should not be too far apart, the head should fit between the pole and the arms\n\n \n\nNote: Since the trick requires good strength training, strong muscles of the arms and back, it is necessary to pump the corresponding muscle ",
