    "description": "After the calm of a raging sea by a strong storm, a beautiful red-haired mermaid appeared.\nShe emerged from the depths and was washed ashore by the waves to the nearest rocks.\nSitting on a stone at sunset, she embraces herself and keeps her eyes closed, feeling the cold blow of the North wind on her skin while she is awaiting the arrival of the starry night.   \n\n\nMermaid is an original handmade terracotta sculpture made by me. \nThis image was edited with pictures taken by me.\n\nOriginal work by Miriam Mora (Anerisart).
