    "description": "Derek paid a professional make up artist and photographer to take this photo of him for his Tinder profile. It cost him 3 months salary and Derek ate a combination of dust, water and bakes beans for those three months. Needless to say, Derek didn't look good for his photo. Poor Derek. ",
