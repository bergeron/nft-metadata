    "description": "This is the first of my flower photos that I allowed myself to share online. I’d only recently discovered my fascination with flowers after a lifetime of intentionally avoiding them for fear showing interest in them might lead to me being outted. I was bringing them home for my partner to enjoy - but as they started to die they demanded my attention.\n\n\nThis image is minted as an edition of 14. Two editions each are gifted to the people who bid on the first drop (4 images) from -SUSPENDED- as a “Thank You” for their interest and support for my work. No editions will be for sale by me - but the recipients are encouraged to keep one piece and use the other as a gift to a friend (like sending flowers IRL) or sell it on the secondary market to help fund further NFT collecting.",
