    "name": "END GUN VIOLENCE",
    "description": "Gun violence has taken our nation by storm. Children, mothers, fathers, aunts, sisters, brothers, loved ones... \n\nThoughts and prayers, right? How many times have we heard that phrase. Yet, nothing has changed and if anything gun violence in the U.S. has gotten worse. Some may feel like their prayers have gone unanswered. But in fact, it is our leaders in power that have gone silent. \n\nThe 35mm film photographs in this NFT document the pain felt around the country from bullets that have slain those who were close to us or maybe just one connection away. Taken at the March For Survivors protest on June 11, 2022 in NYC, 50% of the proceeds from this NFT will be donated to the Youth Over Guns and March For Our Lives non-profits, respectfully.",
