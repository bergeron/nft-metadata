When I paint, I enter another world whose characters are related to my feelings at that moment. If I feel good, happy characters are created, and if I am angry, evil characters are created.\n\nThis painting took me a long time and I emphasized the details so much that you have to look for some of them.\nLook at the details, what attracted you at first glance?\n\nsize:9922*7016",
