    "description": "Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, is a city rich in history and culture. It is the oldest living city in India and was once the capital of British India. \n\nI have been going to Kolkata since 2013 to document daily life at different places. This picture was taken in 2019 and it is one of my best of 2019. I always love to have a foreground, middle, and background to give a sense of depth and I also like to have layers in my street photography. \n\nArtist: Mahesh Balasubramanian\n\nEditions: 15 / 15\n\nLocation: Kolkata, India.\n\nDate: 14th August 2019\n\nArtist Bio:\n\nMahesh is an Independent Photographer from Chennai, India.
