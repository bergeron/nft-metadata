    "description": "This idea came into existence as I decided to form a vision out of the emotion of uncertainty.\n\nAcross northern France and Flanders (northern Belgium), the brutal clashes between Allied and Central Powers soldiers tore up fields and forests, tearing up trees and plants and wreaking havoc on the soil beneath. But in the warm early spring of 1915, bright flowers began peeking through the battle-scarred land: Papaver rhoeas, known variously as the Flanders poppy.\n\nSince that period this bright-colored flower started a symbolic link with the word remembrance in the world of humankind. \n\nIn my story, the human form becomes \"The Flower of Remembrance\" while she lays still in a barren ground of uncertainty. She is the bright poppy flower that grows and will bloom in this human world.\n\nTeam - Roselynn, Harsh and Hita",
