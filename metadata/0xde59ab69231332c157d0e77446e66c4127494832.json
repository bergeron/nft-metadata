    "description": "A woman's true strength is relaxation and tranquility.\n\nFeel this state.\n\nThe black dress holds the mystery of knowledge, hidden from the eyes of most. This secrecy shines like bright stars in the night sky. The bare back is an open rear. It is a gesture of trust in the world. The hem of the dress is puffy; it is a funnel, a symbol of feminine strength. Our dark robes with the raven are the same. We have a connection. A connection of the human and the animal. It is a harmonious connection.\n\nOur minds must be turned to the sky, to the higher and immense. We feel this power in the body. This is the symbol of the inverted triangle (the V-shaped neckline on the back of the dress). The power comes down from above. The raven sits at the level of this symbol.\n\nRaven is wise and free. And so am I.\n\nSelf-portrait.\nCanvas, oil 40/40 cm\nJPEG 3024x3024",
