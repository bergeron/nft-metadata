    "description": "I always wanted to recreate the visual effect of Psilocybin. Thanks to an amazing fluid dynamic simulator, Verve Painter and a bit of animating magic, here it is. I could stare at this all day!\n\nMy opinion of Psilocybin is that if consumed responsibly in a safe environment and with people you love, you will come out of the trip a better person.  Mind opened and ego dissipated. Truly amazing, natural experience\n\nThe original is 4k and is a sight to behold, I'll send it to the buyer.\n\n1/1,  hand painted on my Kanvas, \n1080 HD video in the NFT, original is 4k.",
