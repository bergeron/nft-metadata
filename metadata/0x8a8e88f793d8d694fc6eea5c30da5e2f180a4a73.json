    "description": "“A Body On Fire” depicts overwhelming desire for sexual intimacy while managing risk and responsibility early in the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nIn the sequence, I depict myself in two aspects, one more passive and one more active. The first aspect contemplates and is later lured into an erotic tryst by the second. The tension between them uncovers not just my internal conflict over responsibility and desire, but also external tension between myself and others due to their hard-to-resist enticements.\n\nA KN-95 mask and differing styles of underwear distinguish the two aspects. The Fruit of the Loom \"tighty-whities\" express a bare helplessness while the black Diesel underwear represents unabashed lust and sexual dynamism. As the sequence progresses, however, these visual cues become unstable and ambiguous as to which aspect is really instigating contact and responsible for breaking with social distancing. \n\nSequence Index: 12/12\n\nFormat: Animated GIF\nDimensions: 743×1000\n\n© 2020 Fox Smoulder",
