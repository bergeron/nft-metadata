    "description": "The night I captured this image was the 5th consecutive night I chased northern lights over the course of one week. I spent countless hours researching and watching data, drove hundreds of kms on dark highway roads, and logged limited to zero hours of sleep only to come home empty handed.\n\nBut the beautiful thing about passion and persistence is that occasionally we are gifted the reward of experiences greater than our wildest dreams.  \n\nI have never seen the Canadian Rockies erupt with such a display of northern lights in my lifetime.  In fact, I've been told that this particular storm was a once in a decade event.  What I know for certain, is that there are moments in this lifetime that signal an emotion of deep recognition and universal gratitude.  And sitting here beneath the stars, my path in this life and in this career felt wildly clear.",
