    "description": "This is one of the most iconic murals in Austin, TX. Located at the Native Bar, it has been featured in many publications and TV shows. This painting is a collaboration between Mez Data and Kimie Flores. They took this opportunity to combine their unique styles to create one harmonious image. \n\nWhat makes this painting special is both Mez Data and Kimie Flores are prolific in their own careers and have known each other for many years. This was their first collaboration. Due to the temporary nature of mural work, it will eventually be painted over thus completing its lifespan. By making this piece into a NFT, it takes on a second life and exists beyond the physical world. \n\nThis augmented reality asset is metaverse ready for any collector to enjoy in their virtual environments.",
