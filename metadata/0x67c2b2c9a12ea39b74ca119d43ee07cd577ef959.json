    "description": "Renee Cox’s debut NFT series “Out of Many One People” (2022) evokes the Jamaican slogan in 1962 that celebrates both the independence of the nation and its multi-racial roots, which resonated with global movements in public art from Mexico to China throughout the 20th century. These works are also conceptually connected to the artist’s internationally-recognized style of fantastical self-portraiture, now digitally animated with trippy, psychedelic effects. The series began as the artists experimented with photo editing apps during the pandemic, while also expanding her vision of self-portraiture that encompasses new media, cosmic imaginations, and Afrofuturist ideology.
