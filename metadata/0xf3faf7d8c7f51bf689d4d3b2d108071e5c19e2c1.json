    "description": "“Sand” was Val Kilmer’s audition piece for Juilliard, which resulted in him gaining acceptance as the youngest student ever admitted to their drama department. Halfway through the line “I’m sorry can I start over”, when his auditioners responded he knew he had done a convincing job of delivering a believable performance. Val then went on to become one of the most prolific actors of his generation. This piece is an expression of the beginning of Val’s journey as both an actor and poet, really the only choice for Val’s SuperRare Genesis. \n\nHome footage of Val as a young actor in training appears from the shadows of this portrait of Val performing his iconic role of the poet rocker Jim Morrison by the accomplished painter Michele Petrelli @michelepetrelli https://superrare.com/mpetrelli\n\nThe Award-Winning actor poet Laurence Fuller @laurencefuller gives voice to these words and produced the new media aspects of the piece https://superrare.com/laurencefuller\n\nProduced by BLKPRL Studios @BLKPRLStudios & Kamp Kilmer @kampkilmer\n",
