    "description": "Insecure, vulnerable creatures, shouldn't do psychedelics. Kasha, a lonely and sad wassie once saw a colorful piece of paper and started to lick it. Basic wassie instinct. The trip was intense, dark and full of horrors. Kasha's body couldn't handle the distress and it disintegrated... Into 5555 tiny pieces that eventually mutated into new wassies. Heads inflated, bodies were buff (in smol), no tails (only weird adapters) and bizarre eyes and mouths. Bad Trip Wassies. It all happened in the 60's and not much is known about them but they're now immortalized onchain. How many tabs, anon?",
