    "description": "There is nothing quite like witnessing the elegance of a Mata ray flying through the ocean, coming within an arm length to you, eyes locked before sweeping past or backflipping away, only to return.  \n\nMantas have been threated for years by plastic pollution in the ocean but now the most alarming threat facing manta rays is targeted overfishing due to the increasing trade of manta ray gill plates.\n\nThis set of B&W images is a representation of our beautiful ocean, with a dark side that we have all becoming aware of. \n\nAll profits from sales will go towards ocean stories to highlight the people that are working to protect these beautiful creatures.  \n\n",
