Created in collaboration with fellow artist Natali ( @Tatana)\n\nThis is a collection of Voyeuristic videos created in collaboration with women from around the world.\nWe are watching them from outside their windows, when they think they are Home Alone.\n\nBut there is hint of female empowerment, since\nthe women are in control of the voyeurism; they are the camera operators and the performers. Itâ€™s ultimately up to them what we see.\n\nLicense:\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants. The License includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder.
