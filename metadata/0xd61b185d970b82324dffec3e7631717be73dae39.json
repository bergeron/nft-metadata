    "description": "'Off the Porch' depicts the age-old story of the human struggle for success, as told through the lens of faith. It speaks to the desire for something more, the willingness to take risks and the hard work required to achieve our goals. The figure standing on the porch symbolizes the leap of faith required to pursue our dreams, while the streets represent the challenges we must face along the way. Ultimately, this is a reminder that with faith and hard work, anything is possible, and that we can trust in God to guide us on our journey towards the bag.",
