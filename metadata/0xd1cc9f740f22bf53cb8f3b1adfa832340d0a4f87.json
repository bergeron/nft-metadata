    "description": "This painting evolved. It started out very strange when finishing the painting ‚ÄúOver Shocked‚Äù. Even though I was proud of the painting, I decided to capture it digitally and proceeded to say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to my creative urge to just paint a brand new layer of acrylic over the original. \n\nThis is where things got strange.\n\nAs I was close to finishing ‚ÄúSavory Shock‚Äù,  an ACTUAL mosquito landed on the wet paint (literally on the tongue üëÖü§Ø ). Answering yes to all my creative feelings, I ever so gently lightly brushed paint on the insects legs, forever sealing/binding it to the painting \"Savory Shock\".\n\nWith the divine bug landing occurring, I found the naming of these art pieces, ‚ö°Ô∏èshockingly‚ö°Ô∏èappropriate.",
