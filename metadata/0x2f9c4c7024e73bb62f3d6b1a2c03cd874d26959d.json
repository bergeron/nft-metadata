    "description": "In October of 2021, Schmrypto acquired two shipping containers housing the collected unsold works of Robert Mallary, a pioneer in American digital art. This work comprises the bulk of Mallary's digital output during his time at Amherst from the sixties through the nineties and much more, spanning from childhood paintings created in 1925 to photoshop abstractions dating to the mid-90's. Much of the original code was also present, along with many thousands of pages of manuscripts. The Mallary Project is an effort to revive appreciation for the work of this visionary artist, and to eventually create a large body of CC0 art and code available to creators and artists of all types around the world. This is the first piece of media released by The Mallary Project, a 45 second short film attempting to give a taste of what is to come.",
