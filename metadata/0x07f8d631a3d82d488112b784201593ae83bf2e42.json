    "description": "I've followed this Osprey's habits for a few months. I am not gonna lie, the first attempts were really frustrating, but patience is a sweet companion. \n\nI am pretty sure she heard me scream in awe when I saw the shot in my camera's display, because she did a few circles around me, with her freshly captured breakfast before taking off.\n\n**A high quality print will go to the proud owner of this piece**.",
