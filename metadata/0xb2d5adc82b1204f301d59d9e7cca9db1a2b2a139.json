There are no sketches, models or previous ideas. Just a blank space that breaks up with smudges or unplanned lines of charcoal. When I start to work, I have no clue how it's going to end. I don't even suspect where it's headed. What happens in my drawings is a dialogue between these improvised shapes and the rational responses that arise in front of them.  \nIn my work I see chaos, I see confinement, I see a dangerous world lurking but I also see refuge, protection. Maybe they are blurred memories, maybe they are dreams, fears or longings. It's probably a bit of all of that. The Why of all that, perhaps, I will find out along the way.  \n—\n\nArt by Sergio Figares @circouy",
