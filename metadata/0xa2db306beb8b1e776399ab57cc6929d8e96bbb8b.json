    "description": "About the image : The idol of Lord Shiva was on the side of a street near Girish Park, Kolkata. I used slow shutter to capture the idol's face through the window of a running vehicle. After few shots I got this perfect one. An iconic yellow taxi of Kolkata gave me the right opportunity to click my shot. This is one of the best street shots I have taken. The combination of blue and yellow creates more drama.\nIt has received many awards and has been published many times.\n\nArtist : Arunabha Kundu. \nDimensions : 6000Ã—4000. \nDpi : 300.\nCamera : Nikon D5200. \nLens : Nikon 18 - 105mm. \nDate : 28/01/2020. \nExif : 1/13 sec, F 10, 100, 18 mm.\nLocation : Girish Park.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
