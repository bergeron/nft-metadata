    "description": "Skeletons in the cupboard is an eloquent proverb. What lies behind these skeletons? Is it possible to build a city out of an infinite number of skeletons? Is it possible to build it  in the middle of a desert? Through our dreams, even such wild fantasies become real.\nOur mind is protected from the horror of life by the hidden layers of the skull, but we can only speak to those bones and their owners and our whole world represents a metaphor of a skeleton.",
