    "description": "The spaceship NFT in Genesis minting round includes three VANTERs and one Rainbow Goggles. After opening the VIM Ecosystem, only VANTER (NFT) can be acquired in spaceships summoned by the Users. The Blue spaceship NFT is a NFT that can be exchanged for three common VANTERs (NFT) and one Epic Rainbow Goggles (NFT), and when replaced, Spaceship NFT will be incinerated. The reward boost for Epic Rainbow Goggles is 20 to 29%. After minting, Rainbow Goggles with Epic class or higher are not sold, only through level-up and grade-up. ",
