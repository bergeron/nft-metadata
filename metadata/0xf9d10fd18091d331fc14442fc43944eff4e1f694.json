    "description": "\"Keys to dreams\" by Elena Artgent is a popular original series created with high-quality paints.\n\nEach piece of the series is a unique abstract snapshot of \nwith threads from dreams that extend into real life. \nThe threads of the soul are intertwined, bringing with them the secret meanings of dreams, their purpose and power.\n\nThis collection is based on the mystery of dreams. A different reality, into which we plunge every night. Sleep is not just a disconnection from reality, but another area of being, a second consciousness, replete with adventures and wisdom… It is a portal between the past, present and future. \n\nTHANKS for your interest in my art!\n\nIf you have any questions in mind regarding the artwork please don't hesitate to get in touch as I am always happy to offer advice!\n\nCopyright © Elena Artgent\nMy website https://www.artgent.space/\n",
