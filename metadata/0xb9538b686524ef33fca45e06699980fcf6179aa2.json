    "name": "Two Faces of Ishtar",
    "description": "Ishtar is the goddess of fertility and love and the goddess of war and strife. With one hand she raises to the pinnacle of bliss, and with the other she destroys nations. Can you earn her favor or will you be destroyed by her? Heroes and heroines have staked their lives in the hope of getting close to her, but they have paid a high price. Only heroes whose souls have died can survive beside her. Otherwise, she will consume you. If you want to earn her favor, you must sell your body to a stranger at her temple.  You give your soul to the devil to get close to her, or will you agree to be eaten by her? Her charms are too strong to resist her.",
