    "description": "As the first 1/1 NFT I have launched, I decided to start out with a BANG! \"vulnerable\" is a representation of a feeling that I experienced all through my childhood, as have many. This truck was parked for the last time to slowly decay. With the front bumper removed, it is now left \"vulnerable\" to the elements. All the inner mechanisms that once fired are displayed for anyone to see. Vulnerability has wrongly been given a negative connotation, as it can lead to a vast array of positive outcomes mentally and physically. ",
