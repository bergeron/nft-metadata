The digital data is then converted into physical drawings using a unique method called \"Plotter Drawing\" to complete the physical work.\n\nPlease see [PHYSICALIZABLE WEB](https://physicalizable.com) for details.\n\nPhysicalization is a limit of 10 per NFT. \nPlease check the [current status](https://bit.ly/3p3gJF3).\n\n[Download the SVG](https://bit.ly/3LMaNtL) here.",
