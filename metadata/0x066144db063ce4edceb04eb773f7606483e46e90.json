    "description": "We exist to support systems that are not our own. Ideas, values, and responsibilities are bestowed upon us by an untouchable power. Inherently, we do our best to maintain them; not by choice, but only due to fear of exclusion and isolation. We strain our body and mind around systems that will not support us, even with the knowledge that we could lose our selves on the way. Trained to uphold these imposed beliefs, we don't even see how we are hurting ourselves and those around us.\n\nTo remove societal beliefs from our selves, we first must understand how we enforce them. Does our language enforce a gender binary? Do algorithms effect our views of others? Why strive for someone else's idea of perfection? Why is it wrong to be weird? Are there still new things in the world? Is the prescribed future set in stone? Can I still change? Look inward, so we can change outward.",
