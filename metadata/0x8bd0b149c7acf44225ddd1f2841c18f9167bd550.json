    "description": "Captured here is one of the all-time greatest lightning barrages I have captured in my chasing career. The lightning was nearly constant with such fierce bolts that stuck with some of the loudest thunder booms I have heard. Colorado is known for its magical skies, but this was just so over the top that itâ€™s hard to process it all. Luckily, with some camera knowledge and the lightning cooperating with me, I was able to capture it all!",
