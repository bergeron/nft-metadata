    "description": "Today (01/14/2023) I turned 30 years old. This is a celebration and the beginning of a new journey. \n\nPainting is about uncovering the possibility without having all the answers – similar to the trajectory of my life. My work resembles an expedition of discovery through color, shape, line and form. Born and raised in the Dominican Republic, I moved to the United States in fifth grade. Without speaking English and with no other choice, I adapted to the new world at my fingertips. \n\nI use abstraction as a means of expressing the intangible, and to convey a sense of the spiritual or the subconscious.\n\n– DAY AFTER",
