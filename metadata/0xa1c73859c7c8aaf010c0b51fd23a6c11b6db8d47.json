    "description": "\"Eyes v/s Arrows\" - is symbolical \"The constant work v/s The obstacles\"\nThe eye without the eyelash is ment to see constantly without any break, while the sharpen arrow waiting to get it down. The more it stays there, the more the arrows hit. \nThe arrows not only hit them in pain but also make them stronger, more resistive and boost their confidence. \n\n*It is not 3D art, it is a 2D art;\nThe eyeballs and the arrows are the pencil sketches, which are hand-drawn and then scanned and edited to make it appear like 3D art. It is a new type of experimentation for which I have spent a lot of time in engineering object dimensions and view perspectives.\nOnly a few perspective views will give us the opportunity to render the things like this. I'm glad about the outcome.\nHope the viewers and a lucky collector will like it.",
