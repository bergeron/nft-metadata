    "description": "Origin Story is my genesis NFT series. It is the story of my exploration of photography and my evolving understanding of art told across 5 NFT’s. Each NFT is paired with a personally meaningful image.\n\n---   Origin Story :: Part #1   ---\n\nArt = Choice\n\nIn July 2011, I decided to buy my first camera for a weeklong hiking trip. I walked into Target with $900 in my pocket and deliberated whether I should spend it. I did.\n\nA month later, we drove from Minnesota to Colorado to hike a small handful of 14er’s and returned with tons of memories and thousands of photos. This photo was taken near the summit of the La Plata Peak hike. To photographers, this photo is imperfect in many, many ways. To me, it encapsulates the whole experience of conquering mountains with friends, learning how to use a camera, and the start of a lifelong pursuit.\n\nIn this reflection, I’m remembering that the core of art is intention. Art does not need to be beautiful. Art needs to be intentional. Along the entire creative process, the artist must deliberate over details big and small: vibe, medium, story, etc. Perhaps most importantly, the artist must decide to start.\n\nThis is the first photo I felt proud of making.\n\nThis is my genesis photo. \n\nThis is my genesis NFT.",
