    "description": "Illustrated with a single continuous line for the visage of each portrait, these two KrisK editions serve as companion artworks - inspired by the Northern Hemisphere currently in spring, and the Southern in autumn.\n\nReflecting on her experience living in different regions of the world, this collection aims to capture a feeling of change that is both familiar and new at the same time, and a celebration of our global connections.\n\nSpring is available as an open edition for all to mint from the 21st till the 24th April 2023. Following this, Autumn will be airdropped to those that mint Spring and also hold an Audio Galleries Mint Pass.\n\nThis will happen following a snapshot to be taken on the 26th April 2023 at 2pm GMT.",
