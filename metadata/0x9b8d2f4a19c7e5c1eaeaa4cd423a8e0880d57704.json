    "description": "10,000 unique Angry Polar Bears are living in the ethereum blockchain. They are really upset at us, humans, for being so careless about Global Warming. This is the main reason the Arctic is melting twice as fast; therefore, their habitat is being damaged, causing their species to go in danger with the probability of going extinct. WE, the Angry Polar Bear Club (APBC), aim to create a community that cares about their species and wants to make a change in the world by stepping up and making a difference. Our main goal is to contribute to the never-ending fight against Global Warming and help our Polar Bears achieve the life they deserve.",
