    "description": "The biggest question of humanity is where our past has gone, where our future will go and\n Where are we?\n If you had the power to put two different times in life together and combine them, what would be that two times?   I put Van Gogh in 1888 and Modigliani in 1918\nAt the same time together\n This is from the \"Timeless\" series, a combination of night Cafe from Van Gogh and Alice from Modigliani's.\n Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo about painting a nightclub: In this painting I tried to show that in this caf√© a person can destroy himself and go crazy.  In this painting, Van Gogh tries to show the power of darkness with the help of contrasting colors. But I put  Alice's painting in the Cafe to inspire a sense of calm and harmony.  .",
