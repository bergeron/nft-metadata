    "description": "In this series of works, the symbols and elements taken from different cultures and religions complement structural objects that resemble the brutalist architecture from the modern era. \n\nThese structural elements are designed to appear esoteric and mystical. They are specular and symmetrical, which reflects synergies, strength, power, and most importantly, \"stability\"\n\nThese structures are in a continuous transition, fluctuating in space and moving in different dimensions. They are evolving in the unknown while simultaneously holding their powers.",
