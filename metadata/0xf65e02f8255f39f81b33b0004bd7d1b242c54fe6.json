    "description": "Each new generation of artists pushes the limits of their imagination by simultaneously embracing and defying what has already been created. In order to synthesize new meaning and new aesthetics, they are invited to look back and understand the past first. \n\n'The Encounter Of Minds' embodies the idea of art as a bridge between art movements, styles, concepts and media. Between the classical and the modern, the traditional and the digital, the timeless and the newly created that must yet withstand the test of time. \n\nBridges between eras can only be built by the artists of the present as they are able to look back and connect with the art of the creators before them. In this sense, this artwork is also about the very privilege to transcend time and meet those who created before us.",
