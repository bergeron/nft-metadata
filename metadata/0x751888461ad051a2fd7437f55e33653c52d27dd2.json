    "description": "Title: The present, 2018\n\n\nMy America is an examination of what it's like to live in America as a Black man.  \nThe wet plate collodion process was first introduced in the 1850’s. I use this process to connect the past to the present, and to explore the atrocities of slavery, Jim Crow and the institutional and systematic racism that remains so tightly woven into the fabric of American society. The American Dream is founded on the idea that equality of opportunity is accessible to all people, but it is a dream which continues to be out of reach for a majority of Black Americans. By capturing the Black America that I live every day, I hope to shed light on what people unfamiliar with Black lives either don’t want to see or refuse to acknowledge.\n\nImage size: 3000 x 2410 \n\nHigh resolution scan from unique tintype \n\nEdition 1 of 1 \n\n",
