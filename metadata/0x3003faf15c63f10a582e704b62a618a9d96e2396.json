    "description": "Us photographers all received those texts from close friends that say \"I have a photoshoot idea\". It'll either be shit or extraordinary. This was indeed extraordinary. Don't think too much about why.. just do it. You never know what you'll create.\n\n\nThis was my first time doing night photography on 35mm film and I wasn't sure how the final product would look. \n\n\n\"Raise it high\" - Be comfortable with your sexuality. Own it. Anyone else who doesn't accept you for simply being yourself, raise it high. We raise the middle finger for those who don't accept same sex partners. As women, we raise our finger even higher for having our rights slowly strip away from us.  \n\n\nTalent: Michelle Perazolo & Jamie Renna\n\nSpecial Thanks:  \nKelly Mchugh  \nHaley Jahrmarkt  \nSteven Lomonaco\n\nLocation: Long Island, New York \nFilm stock: Cine800T pushed to 1600\n\n\n15/15 -1155 NFT by Jessica Licata; Minted 2022",
