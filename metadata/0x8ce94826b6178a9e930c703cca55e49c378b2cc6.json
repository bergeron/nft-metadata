It’s still hard to believe I was only 17 years old when I took these, and if my collectors are going to go on this journey with me for the long haul…I want them to start the journey from my beginning…. with the first time I used a camera to create art. \n“Let’s Play Dress Up” is not about what you don’t have, it’s all about what you do have.  The people, places, and things around you and how you’re going to turn them into art, and create mystique, wonder, and intrigue for those who will view and collect your work. With this, I invite you to… \n\nLet’s Play Dress Up & Go in the Attic\n\nEnjoy!  \n",
