    "description": "This is an original artwork depicting the entirety of a level from \"Shapes and Ladders: Battles of Bias & Bureaucracy,\" a new media work first premiered and shown at the 2021 Venice Biennale. It is the first time any part of this game has been released as a NFT. The image is 5883 × 930 full color illustration of the server room in the game.\n\nShapes and Ladders is a video game that shows how systemic racism and sexism can exist in the workplace. Set in the metaphor of a career ladder, players attempt to navigate through an office building rife with challenges. This work was designed to allow players to cultivate empathy through a first person simulation of structural inequality, with the hope that these insights can inspire players to spark change in real life. You can play the full game on shapesandladders.com. \n\n\nThis artwork is part of SuperRare's #TheGoldStandard exhibition featuring artists of Asian American Pacific Islander heritage in celebration of AAPI month.",
