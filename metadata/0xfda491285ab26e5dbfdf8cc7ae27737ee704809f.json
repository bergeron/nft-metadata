    "description": "To be reborn is myth!\n\nThis sculpture of 36 freedom fighters in graphite honors their sacrifices for our betterment! But, the question to ask ourselves is, \"Are we living up to those sacrifices?\"\n\n“Where there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character. When there is beauty in the character, there is harmony in the home. When there is harmony in the home, there is order in the nation. When there is order in the nation, there is peace in the world.”\n                                                                                         - Confucius\n",
