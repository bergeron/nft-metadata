    "description": "\"Sometimes, I donâ€™t know where I am\"\n\nEver since I started photography, I have always been attracted to light, whether natural or artificial. It was after a trip to Japan that I was struck by its omnipresence in the urban landscape of large megacities. This light certainly protects me, but also oppresses and obsesses me. It is continually introduced into the daily life of the inhabitants and shapes their environment. What if we took the time to stop to grasp it, contemplate it?\n",
