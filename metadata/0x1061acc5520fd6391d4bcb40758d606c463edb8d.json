    "description": "Goddess of the earth, mother nature, guardian of the family home, fragile and strong at the same time, the woman is the life-giving force that makes the gardens bloom, the crops ripen, and the earth revolve around its axis.\nThat's how I see her. Beautiful, incredibly beautiful, with pain and sadness in her eyes, but looking at us with a smile and hope.\n",
