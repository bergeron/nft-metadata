    "description": "Good Society 004: Samwyse - wander\n\n...and we're back!\n\nIntroducing a soulful side to our Sound series with this reflective and reassuring track by Samwyse. He is among the most talented artists we've had the pleasure of working with; being a seasoned producer, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist. His music can be found in the popular video game NBA 2K21, as an album launched in tandem with a cannabis strain, and in various music videos or live performances. Everything Sam creates is quality.\n\n“Your greatest blessings in life are always when you least expect it. When you’re following that gut feeling, that intuition will lead you to exactly where you need to be. You’ll never be lost, even if you wander.”\n- Samwyse\n\nJoin our collectors chat → guild.xyz/goodsociety",
