    "description": "When you go to photograph a place like \"Top of the Rock\" in Rockefeller Center, there's always the problem of how to shoot it so it doesn't look like thousands of photos taken from that location.\n\nAfter all, even on the day of the shoot, there are about a hundred photographers there with lenses of different lengths. \nEveryone wants to compete, if you know what I mean.\nAnd you're just like - let's do a panorama through a ten-cm grid. \n\nYou set up a tripod, take a couple of shots, set up for a long shoot, expect a masterpiece and... Immediately a security guard comes running in, and demands to remove the tripod  \"Not allowed, only by arrangement\". He apologizes, agrees that the rule is stupid, but insists. The request for just five minutes does not work (when was the last time it worked at all). Eh...\n\nI had to take from another frame of the grids, and adjust with manual transforms.\nAll the glare and reflections on the grid are also drawn \n\nPhoto 8256  x  5504",
