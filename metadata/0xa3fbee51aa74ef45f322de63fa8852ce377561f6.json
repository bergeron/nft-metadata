    "description": "‘Italian Hot Springs’ #05\n\nItaly\n07.02.2017\n\nEDITION 1/1\n\nTucked deep in the remote mountains of central Italy lives a mystical place. A place only those in the know make their way to these hallowed, spring fed waters. People spend the day taking long soaks in the healing mineral waters, sun bathing and picnicking on delicious local foods. Life’s worries cease to exist in this secret utopia. In America, I suspect they’d franchise this into a themed water park. In Italy, it’s a peaceful day communing with friends and nature.\n\n",
