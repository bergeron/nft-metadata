    "description": "They're slimy, they're ugly and they're cruising your neighborhood looking for a place to crash...don't let them in the house!  They'll ruin your couch, raid your liquor cabinet and eat all your fruit rollups.  Seriously, they're vicious little suckers; they'll steal all your socks, bust a nut in your hair then hotwire your ride and peel out of the driveway with your flatscreen...avoid being their next victim, when you see the SlimeBallZ rolling up, lock your windows and doors, shut the lights and play dead.  If you're lucky they'll leave eventually.",
