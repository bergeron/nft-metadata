    "description": "Painted here is @ellie_gonsalves and this is her story.\n\nRecently she cut off her long hair. For reasons personal and important to her - she also chose to share those reasons with the world. A challenge to the byproducts of our societal construct. Simply put - ‘I’m beautiful, not because you say so, but because I say so.’ Power and confidence- as a father of a teenage girl I thought to myself I want this message to influence and resonate with her no matter what. I didn’t expect what I saw next.\n\nPeople unfollowed, argued, scratched, clawed, screamed and disapproved. I read some people peddling some dog-shit comments. Then I watched Ellie’s stories.\n\nIn her eyes I saw a woman strung between society expectations, her personal choices, her personal opinions, all the noise surrounding her, the chaos. Overwhelmed. She became human to me. I watched closely and decided the world needs to see through that kaleidoscope of noise. This painting is what I saw on that day.",
