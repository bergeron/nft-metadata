    "description": "Chugaister is a fantastic image in Ukrainian mythology, unknown to other Slavic peoples. Yogo was shown as a cheerful, lifelike, overgrown with black or white fox fur from black eyes. He will fall on the mavok, like to lure young lіsorubіv and shepherds from the netrіy and destroy them. For the people, for the most part, the chugayster is not unsafe. Win to love to sit for a human richness and anoint a new spy man. Sometimes a chugayster chomps people into a naughty dance, which is not visible inwardly.",
