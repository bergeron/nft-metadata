They live only in photographs and help communicate a story that a normal picture may not. \n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗵𝗼𝘁𝗼\n\nTaken in Paris behind the D'Orsay Museum at midday, a security guard is resting on a bench during his break. On his phone was the voice of a young child. \n\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻\n\nOur Cracks is a series of mixed media photographs that use characters to represent emotions, thoughts and circumstances we are unable to see. \n\nEach Crack is hand drawn and helps the viewer imagine a story from the photograph in front of them. Importantly, as all of our Cracks are unique, each story will be different. \n\n\n𝙽𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛𝙵𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚍",
