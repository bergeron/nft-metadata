    "description": "\"Devta means God.\"\n\nThis illustration was made as a therapy session to keep my sanity and the creativity flowing at the same time. \n\nIn 2020, I spent a lot of time drawing and producing art. It was calm and therapeutic. Most of the artworks were produced without any preliminary sketches or Ideas. \n\nEverything came naturally. And I can feel that God was guiding me through all along.\n\nThis Artwork has been featured in the illustrator Draw Gallery.\n\nSize : 13780 × 7009\n",
