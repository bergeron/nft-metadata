    "name": "Stop To Smell The Flowers",
    "description": "The sweet smell of grass and flowers brought me back to my childhood. The summer breeze was flowing through open hills of Montana and it felt like everything was going to be just fine. I forgot about everything for a moment and just took a deep breath. The internal dialogue started to get quiet and everything that was keeping me from the present moment got swept away with the breeze. This is what it's like to stop and smell the flowers. I have arrived.",
