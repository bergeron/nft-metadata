    "description": "Title: Starry Night\n\nSpent many days waiting for the perfect conditions to align, the goal was to capture northern lights behind that mountain, which did happen, however it took me many hours waiting for the lights standing in a partially frozen lake at -10C temperatures. \n\nWhile waiting for the lights I captured this shot, and it ended up being my favorite shot of the whole trip, even more than the one with the Aurora. This taught me a lesson: the process sometimes has more beauty and it's more meaningful than the final goal.\n\nNever forget to enjoy the process whatever the outcome is.\n\nThis is a limited edition of 20 minted in the Ethereum Blockchain only.\n\nLicensing: NFT holder can use the image to be displayed privately or in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays with the credit given to the author.
