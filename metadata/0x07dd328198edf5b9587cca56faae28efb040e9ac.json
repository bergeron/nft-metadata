    "description": "This last year my team and I been working on a cool NFT minting app called Galleria. The more we worked on this project, the more we realized that there is still much more room for improvement. Most importantly what do NFTs even do? We do know that NFTs can be the new way of sharing and creating content. You will soon be able to earn money depending on the quality of your content. Simply download Galleria, mint a NFT, and be apart of the new content creator era. One & Zeros is proud to present Galleria.",
