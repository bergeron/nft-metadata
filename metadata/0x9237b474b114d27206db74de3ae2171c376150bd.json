    "description": "Through the cars, moving slowly yet fiercely, the ghost continued its reign and kept looking out for his next prey. The darkness lifted its scariness. No one could easily escape from it and there awaits its prey, waiting to be the victim of the scariest creature’s blood thirsty canines. Tonight, the ghost haunts the moving train and what about tomorrow…? \n\nMinted the first 1/1 3D artwork piece “On Board” from the new collection “The Awaken”, created using  Blender. ",
