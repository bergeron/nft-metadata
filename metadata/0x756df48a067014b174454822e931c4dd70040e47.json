    "description": "Woman, Life, Freedom (Kurdish: ژن، ژیان، ئازادی / Jin, Jiyan, Azadî) or Woman, Life, Liberty is a popular political Kurdish slogan used in both the Kurdish independece and Kurdish autonomy movements, the latter which centers womens freedom and self-governance as one of the main pillars of their social structure in what the movement calls jineology.\n\nDuring the protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, the slogan was used by protestors globally in both the original Kurdish form as well as in Persian (Persian: زن زندگی آزادی, romanized: Zan, Zendegi, Azadi). Libération printed the slogan in Persian and French (Femme, Vie, Liberté) on its front page along with a photograph of unveiled Iranian women protesting.\n#mahsaamini",
