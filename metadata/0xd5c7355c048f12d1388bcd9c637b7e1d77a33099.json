Should I be scared or what? What's this smell and what's that taste all over my mouth? Am I still alive? I hear someone whispering, no!?  \nyup, I'm sure of hearing a melody and my heartbeat in my brain, what's that whisper? I don't seem to understand it but I can sing it.  \noh look, are they,...!!I can recognize the trinity pilots, I see the holly goddess of mothers with her famous protectors! ah, there, the mothers carrying the fetuses, I know them as well as I know we are in the mother ship! how do I know everything? oh, wait, fuq! am I a part of this ?! \"\n\nThese are the thoughts I remember having when I was surprised by the abduction I was experiencing, instead of the colorful paradise I was promised to see by the shaman! \n\nMundus Lucus; is fully inspired by a personal journey within the soul.  \nthe words are originally from the ancient Sumerian language; referring to 'ASTRO PILOT' ;  \nAfter all ,we are all either the pilots or the passengers ,what is obvious is that we are all travelers !\n\n*  \nby Outpsyd \n2022",
