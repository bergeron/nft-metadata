    "description": "A few factors will help you in wildlife photography.  The first is to be patient and the second is to learn about animal behavior.  I had read about this bird and knew it was a curious bird. Several times I tried to attract them to different devices.  Devices like DSLR cameras and a long telephoto lens, or even an old Lobitel camera, but apparently this bird just liked this camera, or maybe the shutter button was more attractive to it. \nWhatever it is, showing human states and behaviors can be attractive to the viewer.  And I think the title of the photographer is suitable for this photo.",
