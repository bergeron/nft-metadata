    "description": "What do you feel when you look at a painting by Rembrandt or a modern photograph? Do you always see behind the curtain?  \nIn Hidden Tales I use AI to alter original photographs I took, and animate them to let you have a deeper look. \nTo give you a hint, to find the hidden tales.  \nThere is often so much more than just the first impression.\n\nEveryone has their own experiences and sees things in a different light.  \nNow what does this piece speak to you?  \nWhat do you associate with a piece of a beautiful girl with scares on her mouth and paint over her eyes?  \nI let you decide if you just want to see a scary animation or if you are brave enough to see what you find behind the curtain.",
