    "description": "Digital Manipulation and Illustration by VMSCH.\n\n“China dolls are to be admired but not much handled, appreciated but not loved because they are too fragile to hold.”\n\nIn 2020 I was clinically diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. After years of heavy bleeding and bruising, skin fragility, and a series of painful dislocations.\n\nThis piece visually explores experiences of pain connected to EDS. \n\nEDS is exhausting, physically limiting, and a mental minefield – feeling so fragile and uncertain that anything could make your body falter. How much more disjointed can you be when you live with joint instability?",
