    "description": "I happen to love cemetery walks. No one needs to die for me to walk through old cemeteries. I don't know if it's the peace I feel or the ornate wrought iron gates, the aged monuments, the draping trees and peaceful and meticulous grounds or the fact it keeps me in touch with my mortality. This picture was taken at the historical Jacksonville, Oregon cemetery in 2017. I had just lost my mother. The photo is a statue on top of a headstone. I wanted to get a proper shot of how I saw this \"Prayer\" happening as if this perfectly depicted the emotions attached to praying. How it affected me was key. This was the shot.\nI chose to use AI for the final print. Four different styles were carefully chosen to blend. The weights were measured into a longer algorithm. I used the highest resolution and 100% fidelity to stay true to the original photograph. I then enhanced the picture up to 6002 x 8000 pixels. For the final enhancement I added motion to the original files.",
