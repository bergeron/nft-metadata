    "description": "After 96Â° in the Shade sold out in three days, a friend suggested I contact a prominent journalist friend who has written about photography for many years and published several notable books. I wrote them a brief, enthusiastic email detailing the project, my influences, my excitement about discovering the NFT space and how thrilled I was to find a new audience for this work, which had been sitting dormant for nearly 18 years. This was their response. It was at that moment I realized the power of NFTs for photographers, and what this would mean for the old guard, the gatekeepers who were suddenly faced with the prospect of either learning a new language and embracing change, or find themselves locked out of the kingdom.",
