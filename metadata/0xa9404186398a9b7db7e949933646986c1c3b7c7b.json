    "description": "The pastel colours combined with the aesthetic and metaphorical possibilities of refraction at first make the ‘thought prism’ or hexagonal head of model Celia Hammond seem like a welcoming place. \n\nThe artist, whose background in textile design fostered a respect for the role of fashion industry to embrace innovation, setting trends and leading movements delves into the process behind intelligence with this piece. \n\nBut it is not all hexagons and roses, so to speak. In the thought 'prism', embedded emojis pay reference to the infiltration of social media into the fabric of our thoughts and how that reflects upon our self-esteem. \nInspired by a Black Mirror episode where humans function only through a social media rating technology, there is a darkness behind the glamour – one where the walls of the prism face in rather than out.\n",
