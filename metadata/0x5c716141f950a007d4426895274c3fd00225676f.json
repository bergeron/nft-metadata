    "description": "**Fangmas Cards** is an Awoo Studios experience to celebrate the launch of the first-ever Fangster Plushie.\n\nThese plushies were crafted by Fangsta Claus, Fang Gangâ€™s abominable gift-bringer.\nThis year, he uses a deck of cards to randomly decide who gets what.\n        \nAll cards are not only collectibles but also display the gifts you can claim.\nThere are different rarities and increasingly more exciting gifts to be earned.\n1 Plushie per card is guaranteed, but other cards can also reward you with Fangsters, PxlFangsters, Totebags and even MORE Plushies.\n        \nTo mint your own cards and claim gifts go **[here](https://fangmas.awoostudios.com)** .\nMake sure to claim the gifts in your inventory before December 31st 00:00 UTC.\n        \n**Before buying** a card on a secondary market, **refresh its metadata** to see if the gift has already been claimed.\nAll sales exclude shipping cost.",
