    "description": "Catrinas are a representation of our traditions from Dia de Muertos in Mexico, where we honor and revisit our loved ones that have passed away. They're always in our hearts.\n\nAs part of the “We are Flowers” Collection, I wanted to celebrate this tradition with a special “We are Flowers: Catrina” Edition.\n\n\"I am UNIQUE\" embodies our magic and inner strength that transcends beyond our lives and unites us through traditions and unique moments full of hope and love. She brings us comfort and peace of mind by remembering our loved ones who are no longer with us.\n\nWe are strong.  \nWe are resilient.  \nWe are beautiful.\n\nWe are Flowers.\n\n16/16 editions.
