    "description": "Mamelles is a small strip of beach flanked by a rocky hill, which used to be a volcano thousands of years ago.  To access it, you must climb down the main road on foot. Itâ€™s a short hike that culminates in a small corridor through the rock formations of the hill, and the view is outstanding. About 100 meters of clear blue-green water generously shaded by the hill where a lighthouse sits. This place used to be my refuge while I was pregnant. Swimming in its deep waters and letting go of the weight of my body. A couple of months ago, Mamelles beach was closed to the public permanently. As the city rapidly develops, more and more parks and beaches are closed to the public. The city feels hotter, more crowded, and tenser as these last connections to nature disappear. Oceanic Takedown is a dystopian scenario where the ocean continues its advance until a city in flux is taken over, its march towards progress made insignificant by a vast and powerful force. 1920 x 1080. Animation created with 3450 generative modelling frames.",
