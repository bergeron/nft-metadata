    "description": "There is something magical about the period when the sun begins to set and the moon becomes visible in the sky.\n\nThe moon is one of my favorite subjects to shoot; itâ€™s so familiar yet so unfamiliar at the same time. Something that we see almost daily, but holds so much mystery and beauty as it cements itself in the sky.\n\nThis composition is a combination of four 35mm photos taken of the moon during different periods of sunset.",
