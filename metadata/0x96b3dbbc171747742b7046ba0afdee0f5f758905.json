    "description": "Just sitting under the window, looking up at the wide sky and feeling the strong wind above. This work tells the story of a person who once felt the freedom to be himself, to run wherever he wanted, but now everything is stuck. The overflow of desire to be free is now restrained by circumstances that force silence. That doesn't mean we can't, but sometimes our choices have to be on something wiser.\nHe is like an eagle with gallant wings, but the choice has led him to perch and just stare at the sky for a while.",
