    "description": "LiveTheLifeTV is getting a rebrand after 25 years. Ikigai Labs is born. Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means \"a reason for being\" or \"a reason to wake up in the morning\". It is the intersection of four elements: what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. When you find your ikigai, you have a sense of purpose and fulfillment. It is a way to find meaning and direction and to live a happy, fulfilling life.",
