    "description": "Tragedy has been part of the lives of the people of the Middle East.\n\nThe people of the Middle East have any fear of aching pain and a new problem.\nAfghanistan is a culturally rich country that has always been affected by civil wars and foreign attacks. In 2021, the Taliban forces dismissed the central government in a domestic rebellion and took power. The same resulted in a sense of calm and the fear of fear in the country.\n\nFear took place so far as families of their daughters hid theirselves and liberated women were destroyed and humiliated.\nThe elders of the government in the fullness of silence went to sleep and collapsed.\nThe war had entered the houses and inevitably the war became an entertaining and, of course, deceptive element.\n\nIn the hope of peace, justice and real progress in Afghanistan.",
