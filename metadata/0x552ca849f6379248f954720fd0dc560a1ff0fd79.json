    "description": "Mixed-media art: pencil, pen, watercolor\n\nJOY is the highest expression of love. Black Joy is anything that inspires, supports, and uplifts Black culture. It is boldly owning your authentic self and walking in your true divine power. It's about doing things that make you feel like sunshine. Remember: if you let your standard of success be your achievement of joy, everything else will fall easily into place. For in the finding of JOY you are finding vibrational alignment with the resources of the universe.  Black joy is embracing the freedom of your inner child and allowing your inner light to shine brightly. This piece is dedicated to highlighting and celebrating black joy!",
