    "description": "ABOUT THE RELEASE:\n\nWelcome to the Fever Dream sessions.\n\nThe songs from this session have an energy that came from being pent up and isolated for over a year during lockdown, to being around each other again and playing music in the same room. And it wasn't just any room either, our friend Darrell Thorp invited us to record this 3-track session in the gorgeous rooms at The Village in LA.\n\nAfter an anxious year of pandemics, covid variants, personal health scares, and all the other bad juju the quarantine era brought, this session was a perfect oasis to break the anxiety that had built up since the lockdown began.\n\nThat's why the joyous energy had us buzzing. How cool was it to be around each other again, playing music with the best people, in the best place? Hopefully, some of that good vibe comes through in the music, and that the songs will help release the feverish anxiety into joyous catharsis.\n\nTrack 2 of 3: Year of Self (Fever Dream Version)\n\nThis version is a hazy redux of our first single ever \"Year of Self\", a celebration of anyone with courage to live earnestly outside the box, not out of rebellion, but out of coming into your own and knowing that's the way you want to live it. The song is also an ode to astronomer Galileo, who was persecuted and ostracized for pursuing his mode of thinking, leading many  to consider him the father of scientific thinking. \n\nPersonnel:\n\nco-produced/engineered/mixed by Darrell Thorp\nRecorded at The Village in Los Angeles, CA\nMastered by Ian Sefchick\n\nVocals, Acoustic Guitar, Omnichord: Edson Choi\nGuitars, Omnichord: Mike Nissen\nJonathan Bradley: Drums\n\nWritten by Edson Choi and Talk Time\n\nAdditional players:\nBass: John Ransom Tucker\n\nCover Art: Mike Nissen\nGolden Egg Art: Lauren Jennings Piper\n\nLyrics:\n\nSay goodbye to yesterday\nAll the pieces there will blow away\nHolding out will serve you well\nThe television is where you'll see your hell\n\nHey misfit, stay true\nIn love with afternoons\nHey misfit, stay true\nEvil comes after you\n\nThe world will cover you in pain\nBut a burning heart is set in every way\nThere's never an easy circumstance\nAll we do is fake it to be romanced\n\nHey misfit, stay true\nIn love with afternoons\nHey misfit, stay true\nEvil comes after you\n\nÂ©2023 Talk Time",
