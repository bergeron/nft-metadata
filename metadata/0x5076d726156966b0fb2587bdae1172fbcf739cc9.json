    "description": "The title of this piece coincides with the 2007 adventure/drama that depicts the true life of Christopher McCandless, a recent college grad who decided to leave a successful, yet unfulfilling life back home to venture 'into the wild'. While extreme, I deeply resonated with the basic ideology that fueled his motives; fulfillment. For me, arriving to Grand Teton National Park did just that. ",
