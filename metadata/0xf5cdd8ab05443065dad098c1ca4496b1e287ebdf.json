    "description": "She is me and I am her. The first contact I had with digital art was when I did my self-portraits. I'm far from being narcissistic but drawing myself opened a door I didn't know before. Drawing myself has encouraged me to develop my own style and to dare to create more. Spending hours in front of my own face drawing it has allowed me to accept myself more and enjoy seeing my reflection in the mirror more and more every morning. Today if I can give my own definition of self love, I would say that it is to know how to draw myself in the best way and to be able to make it my ART\n\n1657 x 2029 px  300 dpi ",
