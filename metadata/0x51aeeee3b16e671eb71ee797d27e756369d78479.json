    "description": "A photograph from the archives shot on one of a December 31st. The last Sunset of the year, a part of my photojournalism project for the New Year's standalone story. As the last rays of the setting sun dance across the waves, the sandy beach in Goa is transformed into a vision of beauty. The water glistens like liquid gold, and the sky is a riot of orange and blue blending together in a stunning display. People strolling around the beach, its silhouette etched against the fiery sky. With the gentle sound of the waves crashing against the shore and the warm breeze caressing your face, this moment feels like a dream, one that will be forever etched in your memory.",
