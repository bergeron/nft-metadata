    "description": "My mind is a prism, trapping me in an array of color that come to life in a splash of pastel. \n\nThere was a future I had painted once before, but I like this one better. It is unplanned, like a rainbow created from the shimmering scales of ocean life. \n\nI wont ever be able to live out on the sea, but I am not lonely with this thought. I will always be able to swim with the creatures I bring to life in my dreams. ",
