    "description": "Digital collage art created using my own photographs of the British Countryside. The original photo here was taken on a hike up Lingmoor Fell in the Lake District National Park, amazing views in all directions! The old slate quarry buildings (ruins now) are still to be found up Lingmoor and give a real sense of history. \n\nQuarry workers would hike up this mountain everyday to mine the slate from the mountain-side enduring all conditions, many men suffered both injury and death extracting slate from the fell-side.
