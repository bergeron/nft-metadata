  "metadata": "﻿{\r\n  \"name\": \"Apostles\",\r\n  \"description\": \"Image part of *Claudiu s, internationally published, multiple award winning baroque inspired series*. In author s own words: ``The 16th-17th centuries painting has always been close to my soul. I fell in love with the drama of chiaroscuro, the atmosphere, the chromatics, the composition of the baroque paintings.  *Rembrandt, Rubens, Vermeer, Caravaggio*... Only when I started to look at the work of these titans with the hungry eye of the photographer in search of an aesthetic to resonate with, did I really begin to see. This is when I truly began to feel that my work fulfills me creatively. I started with simple portraits and with a lot questions. How would the Old Masters have done it? What would the lighting be? The color scheme? The expression, the atmosphere?…How it would have made the viewer feel? From portraits I went to somewhat more elaborate scenes, of two or three characters, usually of mythological or biblical inspiration, sometimes including a slight erotic twist to the mix.`` 1/1 NFT Digital asset (NFT) dimensions: 5126px x 6408px, sRGB, .jpeg file.
