    "description": "Shyam Sundar\n\nShyam is another name for Lord Krishna. Shyam means cloud colored, dark and beautiful, or One with the beauty of the evening, in this artwork I have tried to portray the same. \nKrishna is the eighth incarnation of Shree Vishnu descending to earth for protecting Dharma and spreading the knowledge of Moksha. \nHe is Yogeshwara, the overlord of every kind of Yoga and he is the one who gives us Bhagavadgeeta which is the highest form of yogic knowledge on earth. May the divine and beautiful Shyam Sundar bless us with spiritual wisdom and Moksha\nTools used - Procreate and Photoshop\n\nLicenses : CC BY-SA",
