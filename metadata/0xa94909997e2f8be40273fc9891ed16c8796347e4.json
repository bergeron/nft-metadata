Was there a cliff? Was the path continuing? The longer I stood there the more I thought that for me the fog clouding the sight in this capture stands for the uncertainties and insecurities of the future. Because, won’t the future always be a little unclear? And when I was standing at this point, I realised that I have only two options. Either I stay right where I am or even walk back ways I already cleared and can be sure of what awaits me there. Or I give it a chance and risk discovering the ways I still have to open up and let me surprise by what the future holds for me. And isn’t that exactly what makes life so exciting and worth living?\n\nEdition 1/1",
