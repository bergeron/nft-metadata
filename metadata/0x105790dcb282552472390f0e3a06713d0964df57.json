    "description": "EMBRACE is a piece Iâ€™ve dedicated over 4 years to achieve. The project evolved into a personal journey prior to the birth of my first child. The idea of two lovers together creating life. It became the idea, and feeling, of warm liquid hugging the contours of a face. A darkened backdrop intertwined with colorful, saturated, bright, and wet highlights. Micro details give the viewer the sense of movement and motion.\n\n2000 x 2000 pixels\n\nCreated by Bryan Coleman December 2021\n\nBryan Coleman is an American digital artist with a degree in time based media. Bryan has worked with companies across the globe and he focuses on the creation of an idea for a wide range of projects.",
