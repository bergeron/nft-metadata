They will be stored, forever, in these big Costco Freezers and the Choco Taco will NEVER DIE. Actually, it is up to you. Each Choco Taco NFT represents a real Choco Taco in our Choco Taco Treasury. IF you so choose to burn your Choco Taco NFT, your IRL Choco Taco will be sent to you. With Great power comes great responsibility. Choco Taco Forever, Mozzy out.",
