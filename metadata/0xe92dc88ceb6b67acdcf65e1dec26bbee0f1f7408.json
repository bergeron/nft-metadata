    "description": "GmGn Fam I am glad to present to you my fantasy for the ENTITIES META collection, which I was inspired by by chance seeing Vasily Popov's interview on YouTube. I was inspired by the fact that a man has achieved success in his creative path, and was the first to launch into space a physical copy of the NFT with the image of an astronaut from his ENTITIES META collection. Below I will present all links to the author of this collection, as well as links to my collections.\n\nPromo video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKAItaKD_Z4\n\nENTITIES META https://opensea.io/collection/entities-1-101\n\nArt Surreal Genesis https://foundation.app/collection/surr-genesis\n\nCRYPTOLOID WEEKS https://rarible.com/cweeks/items",
