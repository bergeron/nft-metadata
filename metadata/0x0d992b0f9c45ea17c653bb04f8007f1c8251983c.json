    "description": "This photo was taken with inspiration from the following passage in a book by the novelist Yaşar Kemal.\n\n“The Yazidis turn to the sun three times a day and pray. Everyone, whether they are children, young or old, sheikh or emir, they turn their face to the sun and tell the sun what passes through their mind. These are perhaps the most beautiful prayers the human race has ever said. Perhaps, the most beautiful folk songs and the most beautiful poems came from these prayers. Perhaps these prayers are at the root of all the epics of Mesopotamia.”\n\nPhotographer: Serhat Karasungur\nCamera: Canon EOS 6D Mark II\nLens: Canon 16-35 mm F4\nLocation : Tokat / Turkey\nDate : 07. 09.2019\nDimensions: 4160*6240 300 dpi\nEdition: 1/1\n",
