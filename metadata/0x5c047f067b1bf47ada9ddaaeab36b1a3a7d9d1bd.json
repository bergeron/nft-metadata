    "description": "Two artists, **Josh Pierce and Tyrone J. Webb II** on opposite ends of the United States with similar styles came togeth  \ner to meld two completely different mediums, *Spray Paint* and *Digital Art*. The end result, a collaboration indistinguishable from their solo artworks!  This collaboration took over a year to complete and will set the tone for future artworks by the pair. This is a **\"First Of It's Kind\"** Art project and a slice of Art History.  \n\nThere will be a burn & redeem launched after the initial mint, where you can burn a set number of the **.jpg** to receive the final version which is an **.mp4** with motion and original music and optimized for IRL and Metaverse display in Spatial.\n\nThese will be your ticket to so much more, be one of the lucky ones to get it, \n\n**We thank you for your support!  **",
