    "description": "Eyes are the mirror of the soul. Where words are restrained, the eyes often talk a great deal.\nIn the photograph, I call the girl as Agnikshana-where Agni and ikshana are two Sanskrit words which defines Fire or fiery eyes.\nWhile I was taking the shot, her eyes were manifesting a charismatic and draconian glimpse to me.\nI felt she wore her truth and fire of love in her eyes. The beauty & grace could be seen in her enchanting eyes leading to her heart where love resides.\n\nPhotographed by: Arun Hegden\nFormat: Jpg\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 3732x5557",
