    "description": "In 1937 in England\nChalton's goalkeeper Sam Bartram was still inside the net until 9 minutes after the game whistle! Due to the loud noise behind the goal, he had not heard the referee's whistle and was standing inside the goal with his senses, looking carefully forward so as not to be surprised in front of his opponent!
