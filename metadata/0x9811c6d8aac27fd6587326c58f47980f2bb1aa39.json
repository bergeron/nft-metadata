    "description": "The conceptual photographer Corinna Holthusen is known for her suspenseful portraits that mirror today's ideals of beauty and the artificiality associated with them. Her effect on us viewers is like an ambivalent tightrope walk between fascination and cringe.Through a complex image editing process, Holthusen digitally superimposes a multitude of physiognomies",
