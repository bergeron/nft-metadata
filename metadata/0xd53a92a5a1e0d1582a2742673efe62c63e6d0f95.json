    "description": "Gadz is the name of students and alumni from the prestigious engineering school of Arts et Metiers founded back in 1780 by the duke de La Rochefoucauld in France.\n\nSince then, the Gadz community takes to heart to transmit its ancient traditions and legacy based on the values of fraternity, solidarity, equity and camaraderie coming in part from their military background.\n\nGadz folklore includes traditional clothing, slang, songs and legends, related symbolism, and ceremonials.\n\nArt takes a big part of the Gadz life. The \"Biaude\" traditional clothing design, gothic calligraphy penmanship, traditional artifacts woodcraft and ironwork to name a few are some of the ways for Gadz to express themselves in an artistic way.\n\nGadzchain NFT is an AI-stylized version of a \"Monome\" or line of Gadz marching and singing while wearing a Zag uniform. It is the perfect representation of the Gadz traditions and values as a single entity.\n\n\"Fraternity such remains our motto, such it shall be for every Gadz'Arts.\"",
