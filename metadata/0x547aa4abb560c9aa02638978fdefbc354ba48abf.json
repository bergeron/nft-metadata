    "description": "On The Way Down is the first song I've produced in years... \nI've co-produced all my songs with other musicians and I'm usually very hands on with the mix, but I haven't sat down and made a beat until last May. On the living room floor in Lisbon, I sang into a loop machine, trying to prove my worth to someone whose heart has already left me.\n\nThe lyrics talked about time lost being apart, \nmessage received, \nand next time on the way down, I won't follow. \n\nfun fact, It was written around the same time LUNA crashed.\n\nThis is the third and final song off of Private Room EP, my genesis music NFT release. \n\nMixed and mastered by FenixProd from Lithuania! \nWe connected through Squad of Knights.\n\nAlbum art by Tiffany Ou and Zach Ginnever at Seker Factory DAO",
