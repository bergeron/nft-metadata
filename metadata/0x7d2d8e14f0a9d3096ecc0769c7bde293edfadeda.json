    "description": "Do you know what loneliness is?\nYes, it is clear, \"everyone has their own perception of this sensation and everyone is under the same comb, it is impossible\"â€¦\nAnd it seems like you have a lot of acquaintances / friends / with whom you communicate well, but what in the end? Are you feeling all right? Are you satisfied? How many people can you call close? Alone? Two? Nobody? Who are they all to you then?\nIt seems like just today, you met, had a great time, you had fun, but it's over, they went home, and the result? Emptiness..\nAround you are your favorite things, as it seems to you, and, it would seem, everything should be fine. You collected it all around you so that it would be comfortable for you and your friends to spend time, but there is no one and your emotional content from these things fades over time.\nQuiet music, wind, there is no one, you close yourself in, the illusion of freedom, happiness is emptiness..\nDon't leave me, friend. Stay close, we'll burn together.",
