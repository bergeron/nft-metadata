    "description": "Spectrum anomalies are gravitational singularities, they occur when space and time converge following physical laws unknown to us. In a classic representation of space-time, when a mass is inserted, the plane reacts by bending and deforming in ways we know. Instead, when it interacts with abnormal entities, which go beyond the 3 dimensions, the space twists into a shape that our brain is unable to define. This collection therefore aims to give a representation to these anomalies.\n\nImage dimensions 5418 x 4168",
