    "description": "This work is my favorite piece in the \bWHITE series. I met this little pine tree in the mountains of Gangwon-do,  where it snowed.\n\nA moment of stillness and silence where all the surrounding sounds and scenery disappeared.\n\nThe feeling of awe when confronted with a single being is indescribable.",
