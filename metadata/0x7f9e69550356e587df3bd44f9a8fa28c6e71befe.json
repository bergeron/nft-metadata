    "description": "If you had one gift to give to yourself, what would it be? More money, better relationships or simply more inner harmony?\n\nA peaceful life is yours when you remove ego and desires completely and visualize yourself as a peaceful being. If we look at our life as a series of experiences, we will appreciate the importance of our thoughts and emotions as we go from one day to another.",
