    "description": "Chromesthesia is an ongoing body of work that explores the relationship between color, sound, and movement. The projectâ€™s foundation is a set of original drawings, paintings, and fractal creations manipulated and distorted through a combination of software, apps, and AI. These outputs are then deconstructed further using a MIDI controller and/or complex algorithms until the desired piece is created. The process is iterative, destructive, and cannibalistic, resulting in glitchy abstractions connected through lineage.",
