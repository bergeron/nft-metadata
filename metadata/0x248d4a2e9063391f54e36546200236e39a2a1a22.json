    "description": "The photo represents the portrait of a magnificent venetian costume and mask dressed during the Venice carnival.\n\nTheyâ€™re handcrafted in a very few artesanal shops in Venice and delivered worldwide. \n\nThe photo itself was captured during the evening, right after the sunset, under the colonnade surrounding the San Marco square.\n\nThe hard part in capturing these masks and isolate them is the amount of people always around, looking for a photo, a selfie with them or simply admiring.\n\nI looked for a low angle to be able to capture the whole dress and a wide open aperture for a shallow depth of field.",
