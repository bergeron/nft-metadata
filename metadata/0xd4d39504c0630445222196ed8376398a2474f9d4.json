    "description": "Date Created: 11/15/21\nThis NFT represents all the aspects that make me an artist. This robot was called \"Papin\" and was named after my nickname. The Electro Buggie dance brings me memories of the days i starter making graffiti. Art, Music and Breakdancing started by hand and represents my culture. The toaster in his head is my graffiti tag and has become an icon in the art scene around the world. The chrome on his body represents the hyperrealism technique I use in my murals and paintings.",
