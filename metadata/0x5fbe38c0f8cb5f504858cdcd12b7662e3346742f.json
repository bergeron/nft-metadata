    "description": "You may recognize this one if you paid close attention. Yes, this is the iconic helmet Mansell wore during the legendary 1991 British Grand Prix where, after crossing the finish line and winning the race, he picked up a stranded Ayrton Senna who had run out of fuel on the last lap, and drove the Brazilian back to the pit lane. Two fierce competitors driven by the same incredible passion and ethic.",
