    "description": "These burning eyes, the strength and grace of movements. In this picture, the elements of fire and water are intertwined, the impossible becomes possible without a struggle.\n\n It is a harmony of opposing forces, ecologically overcoming all obstacles without destruction.\n\n The combination of contradictions gently protects those who are dear to her, and with one glance scares away the aggressors. \n\n This painting is a magic amulet for its owner.\n",
