    "description": "The Vittoriano of Rome, known as \"Altare della Patria\", is a symbolic monument of Italy, as it was built in honor of King Vittorio Emanuele II, who initiated the unification of the Kingdom of Italy (for this reason the name \"Vittoriano\").\nThe imposing construction was built by the architect Giuseppe Sacconi in 1885, and ended in 1935.\n\nToday it represents the celebratory monument par excellence of the Unification of Italy and its freedom. The real purpose of the monument was to symbolically group all of Italy through the use of colossal sculptural groups. There are those of Thought, of Action, of Concord, of Strength, of Law. To these are added the bas-reliefs of Labor, of Amor Patrio, of the Fountains of the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian Sea, and of the statues of the Regions of Italy. Finally, we find the mosaics of Faith, Wisdom, Peace and above all the quadrigae of the Unity of the Fatherland and the Freedom of citizens.",
