    "description": "The seed of all melodies, \"பண்\"; is the truest representation of Tamil music, culture, land and its people. A voyage that connects the past, beholds the present and accompanies into the future, Pann is the beginning of a journey into the world of performed, programmable art. \n\nPann is one of the first async classics to be brought into the world of Blueprints(Time Limited Editions). Originally a 30-minute piece with 9 layers, each with multiple variations, this blueprint version of Pann has 3 different movements from the classic, with the same number of layers and variants in each movement. The classic had 19440 possible combinations while this blueprint has a whopping 58,320 possible combinations which can be minted during this time period.\n\nThe artwork features the unique work of visual artists Susha, Ghana and Vidhya Vijay. The elements in the artwork correspond to different musical elements along with a lyrical representation in Tamil, one of the oldest languages in the world. A total of 42 artists have collaborated on creating this masterpiece.",
