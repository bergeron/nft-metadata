    "description": "Born in 1857, Victoria Van Vander was a renowned beauty, heralded for her external and internal elegance. \n\nOne day she found a local shop that offered injectable “lip medicine.”\n\nPuzzled, she ignored it. Why would one do that? \n\nHowever, soon her friends were all returning from the village with plump lips and glowing smiles. \n\nEventually, after feeling an inkling of self-doubt, she decided she too must try it.\n\nSoon, she was a frequent customer of this beloved little shop. \n\nShe didn’t think much of it until she sat for a portrait one day. The painter made small talk and then asked, “Are those your real lips?”\n\nShe said, “well, of course!”\n\nThey were...real. Right?\n\n// An AI-assisted piece by ClownVamp. Using a custom stable diffusion model, trained on real images of lip filler results, further enhanced using Stable Diffusion and Photoshop. \n\nBiography: \nClownVamp uses AI-assisted techniques and narrative writing to explore alternative history and alternative art history.",
