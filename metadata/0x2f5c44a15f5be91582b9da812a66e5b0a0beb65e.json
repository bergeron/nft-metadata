    "description": "Qdragons is a collection of 3333 cute, cuter, and probably the cutest dragon NFTs on the blockchain created by three enthusiastic, dedicated common people.\n\nBased on hundreds of hand-drawn elements, a randomization algorithm is used to pick out the most unique Qdragons out of millions possibilities.\n\nQdragons adopters not only own the original art in high resolution but also are eligible for exclusive Qniverse events funded by the Qmmunity fund.\n\nThe Qdragons project aims to bring more cuteness in the virtual world and increase utility to its actual owners.",
