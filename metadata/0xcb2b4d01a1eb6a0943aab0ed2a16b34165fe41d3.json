    "description": "January 2023\nI want to explore what an object actually is when we make an object for the digital environment. \nAfter spending three weeks playing with \"digital\" highlighters and pens in the Notes app on MacOS, I discovered that different blends of colors create shadow, distance and the illusion of space and dimension.\nClearly this is two dimensional, but one can look at it with enough detachment to separate logic from appearance and enjoy the way it floats and also excites the mind with its hues. \nAll features of this piece are \"hand-made,\" in the sense that the colors and the textures come from hand manipulation of materials that are photographed, changed in Photos app, and then painted in Procreate. \nI do not use traditional editing software. \n",
