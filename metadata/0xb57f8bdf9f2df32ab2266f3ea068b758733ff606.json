    "description": "Sitting at the coffee shop, staring at my screen  \nNumbers and figures, a financial scene  \nMy mind begins to wander, to a different place  \nA feeling of detachment, from the work I face  \nI watch the world go by,  \nThe morning rush is hectic,  \nBut I'm in my own supply.  \nI'm here but not quite present,  \nMy thoughts drift far away,  \nDetached from all the chaos,  \nJust here to work and play.  \nThe scent of roasting beans,  \nThe clink of porcelain cups,  \nAll blend into the background,  \nAs I type, with steady ups.  \nI find a sense of comfort,  \nIn this detachment state,  \nThe coffee shop's my haven,  \nA place to contemplate.  \nAnd as the day wears on,  \nMy work may take its toll,  \nBut the coffee shop's my refuge,  \nA place to soothe my soul.",
