    "description": "Decaying Flowers, is a vivid visual study of beauty and mortality, placing the youthful curves of black and white nudes alongside heavily colour-saturated, yet simultaneously dying, flower still lifes. \n\nThe fluid curves of the female body are mirrored in the soft shapes of wilting petals, both still bearing their organic imperfections, be it in the form of a birthmark on the lower back or veins tracing their way through the decaying floral matter.\n\nMy Veins focuses on the texture of the skin, touching on the similarities of our flesh to the petals.",
