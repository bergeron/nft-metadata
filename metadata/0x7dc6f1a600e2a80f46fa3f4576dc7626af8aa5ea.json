    "description": "In ancient and medieval culture there are many works in which a woman attempts to comprehend the specifics of female existence.\n\nThe accusation of a woman that she was the main culprit of original sin was determined by the very essence of the medieval worldview, which has not yet been erased from the minds of the masses.\n\nIn the patriarchal world, a woman is a sinner by default, because it is a woman who is accused of original sin, wars, failures on ships, and so on. And this work is about that.",
