    "description": "THE BREAKS:\n\nWritten, produced, redcorded: Matt Monday\nCo-produced, mix, master: Black Dave\nKeys, Strings: Jonathan Lovett\nGuitar: Thomas Kenney\nArtwork: Matt Monday\n\nThe Breaks is an audio journey that introduces my hometown North Charleston, SC. It begins with the sounds of banter and outdoor activity, followed by strings that resemble the feeling of the summer warmth in the air. As we progress through the day we are met by upbeat experiences and various encounters that further provide details into the nature of the environment. The song ends on a guitar solo that spirals into the later parts of the day as we are met with the countless obstacles such as opposition, uncertainty, and the law, â€¦these are the breaks.  \n",
