    "description": "In this series of photographs, I was documenting an illegal eviction of a lower-income neighborhood in Seoul, South Korea. I wanted to capture the transition from small traditional home dwellings to Soviet-Style cookie-cut multi-story high-rises. I wanted to show that these families were forced out of their homes in the middle of the night. In the photographs, you can see a cross-section of their home and by doing so you can see what they could bring with them and what they had to leave behind.",
