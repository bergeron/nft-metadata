    "description": "100 Polaroids | 18437x19265 pixels | 136mb | Year: 2022\n\nThis is the Polaroads final artwork.\n\nI worked to find the right composition and matching of the 100 Polaroads to create infinite stories.\nThe more you look at it the more you'll find new ones. It's all in your mind.\n\nPolaroads is a project of 100 Polaroids born in 2021. \n\nA collection of 100 unique landscapes, life and geometries on asphalt caught on Instax Polaroid.\n\nWhile walking the streets people usually look ahead to their destination with the head held high.\n\nInstead, I looked at my feet and I began to wonder.\n\nI saw figures, natural and urban landscapes, things that no one would expect to find on the asphalt.\n\nIn something that may seem dead I have seen life.\n\nThe single Polaroads can be find on Opensea.\n\nThis NFT includes the physical artwork, professionally framed and with UltraVue glass.",
