    "description": "\"Peace is dead, but the light of hope shines on us\"\n\nPeace is dead, And we grieve its loss. But the light of hope shines from every direction, easing our wounds and sorrows. It soothes our battered and weary spirits and rekindles our hope, igniting love's flame. We catch love's feathers and soar to the heights of freedom. And thus the world, from inside and out, will be filled with peace, hope, love, and light. Birds will fly freely in the boundless sky, and love will light up every heart.\n\nPhysical details:\n\nOil on canvas\n40x40 cm\n2023 \n\nDigital details:\n\n3107.3156  pixel",
