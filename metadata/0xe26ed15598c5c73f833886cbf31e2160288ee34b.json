    "description": "The Martian Ambassador is the secondary antagonist of Tim Burton's Mars Attacks! As every Martian in the movie, The Martian Ambassador is a mean, dark figure that speaks through constant use of the word \"Ack\", but his duty is far more superior than the other Martians. Not only he is the Martian representative in Earth's government, but the Martian Leader's second-in-command, meaning he also has a huge influence over the invading troops.",
