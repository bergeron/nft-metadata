    "description": "Princess Gollum Explores Self Expression in a Digital Reality. This project is the fruition of forward-thinking artists and designers across the globe as commentary on the various ways the landscape of fashion is changing. The editorial has been pieced together remotely by computer rendering composed with 3D and physical fashion. In the same way, fantasy is for imagining the possibilities of new worlds; digital fashion explores the extent of clothing as both a requirement we are going to increasingly need to tweak to our ever-changing world, as well as an opportunity for brands and designers to reinvent the meaning of getting dressed. Each animation has been minted and released on Nifty Gateway.\nDirected by Ale Washington and Jeremy Bali, featuring works by Edward Harber, Olia Svetlanova, Juanita Care, Lorette Colé Duprat, and Ai studios draped over Princess Gollum’s virtual extension.",
