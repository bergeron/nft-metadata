    "description": "DESCRIPTION:\n\nResigned to a permanent smile, this creature emerged from the residual energy of the TV owner's preferred genres of entertainment - a hybrid of comedy and science fiction; forced into existence against its own will.\n\nBIO:\n\nChroma Code is a Canadian artist that specializes in analog glitching, photography & filmmaking.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n\"Joie De Vivre\" is a piece of art generated by an AI and subsequently modified/composited using image editing software. The modified image was then transmitted through an analog signal chain, which was then directly rendered onto a CRT TV manufactured between 1990 and 2002, utilizing a conversion process. The artwork was deliberately distorted and color graded through the use of various video synthesis hardware. Finally, the piece was refined and polished using video editing software.\n\nVideo Size: 2160 x 2700px\nTV Model & Year: Sylvania, 2002",
