    "description": "“The invisible shelter”\nThis AI art piece portrays towering old ladies amidst a scattered landscape of broken little pieces of houses and tiny people below her. The grandeur of her form and the fragility of the world she inhabits are juxtaposed in a powerful image that provokes contemplation on the themes of aging, power, and decay. The mind that is like a house is a recurring theme, offering shelter and comfort in a world that can often be harsh and unforgiving.",
