    "description": "This image is one of my favorites of this essay. Many things about it are special. The little boy stood out to me the first time I saw him. He always trained hard, but then, this one time I couldn´t see him, amongst the other athletes, inside the boxing gym. After looking for him for a while, I found him standing in the outside-ring-area in the yard. All by himself, he was all calm, almost like in a meditative state of mind.  \nThat´s when I could tell, that he was very serious, with his love for boxing.\n\n\nLeica M10\n\nEDITION: 1/1\n\nLICENSE: EXTENDED EDITORIAL\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
