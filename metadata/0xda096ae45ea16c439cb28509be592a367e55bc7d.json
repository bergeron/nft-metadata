    "description": "March, 2014.\n\nIf I had to choose a favourite image I've ever taken, the memory of this moment would have this image competing for 1st place in my mind.\n\nIn reflection, this was perhaps the defining moment that directed my photography into what it is today.  It was the first moment I found myself in a complete space of stillness and presence while in front of the camera; as if time froze altogether, and I was just there, suspended in a dream... yet fully awake, breathing, with a sense of being completely in tune with my surroundings.\n\nI felt drawn to walk out into the water, to capture this feeling of calm and stillness.  While I stood there, completely motionless but for the soft ripples, I realized this was the kind of peace I wanted to channel into my art.  Thus began my true journey into my self portraiture of today - a way to connect with, and to share that connection, with nature.\n\nFun fact:  I wore tall rubber boots to stay dry, but walked too deep and they filled up.  Worth it.\n",
