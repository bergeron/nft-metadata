    "description": "Not many cities where you can hit the slopes and the beach in the same day. A photograph that captures the quintessential day in Los Angeles that took years to capture under just the right conditions.\n\nClear visibility from the Pacific Ocean to the San Gabriel Mountains is rare with the limited angles to photograph it from and the constant smog and haze. Snow lining the entire San Gabriel range might only happen once every few years. \n\nI was lucky enough to photograph this scene after the clearing of a major storm during golden hour. To date, it is one the most unique photographs I've had a pleasure to take of this beautiful city.",
