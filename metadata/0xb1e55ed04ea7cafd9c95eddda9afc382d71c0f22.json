    "description": "This photo will always have a special place in my mind and heart. It was the first photo of this kind I took and I had it in my mind during the whole autumn. I just needed heavy snowfall and a forest. Between Christmas and New Year's Eve I took the opportunity of a good forecast and a day off as well. A spruce forest in Lower Austria served as the backdrop for a symphony of snowflakes swirling down to the ground. The fine lines they were painting on this image show the snowflakes' dancing grace â€“ and it made me happy.",
