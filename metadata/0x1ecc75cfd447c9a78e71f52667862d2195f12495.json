    "description": "This is a story about a broken love, two people who aren’t good for each other - but they’re addicted to the love. I think we’ve all experienced the feeling of not being able to stay away from someone or something even when we know it’s bad for us. That in essence is what this song is about.\n\nMy favourite line is “take me into red skies, yeah we blurry by the moonlight.” I am obsessed with fine art. To me that imagery feels like a Monet painting - the almost trippy feeling of being under someone's spell.  I love expressing feeling through colors and images. \n\nHyped to have Kevin as a part of this song! His tone and his pen are insane - it's an absolute honour to have him on this one!\n\nAlways grateful for my producer, my day one, Carson. A true legend. He brought the magic with his incredible sound design, translating my simple ideas to a piece of art I'm so proud of. \n\nThank you for supporting! Hyped to be on this Web 3 journey with ya'll! ",
