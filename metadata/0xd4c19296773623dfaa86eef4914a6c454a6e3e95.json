    "description": "My genesis standalone piece on foundation dedicated to the Father of our nation who employed non-violent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's Independence. Alongside some of the national symbols  in my style . I purposefully hid few of them for the art admirer to find out.\nThe artwork also consists infamous monkeys which are not so bored apes (pun) and Charaka which was a symbol of swadeshi movement.\nThe artwork also describes the current situation of the world where there is more Chaos and War than Peace in a  subtle way. \nThis artwork took almost a month to finish and done with Procreate.",
