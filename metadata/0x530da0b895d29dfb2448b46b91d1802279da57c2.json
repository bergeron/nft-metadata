    "description": "This 1/1 piece corresponds to the single \"Violet Nights\" from @alliemoves sophomore album \"Tabula Rasa.\" The skull is a stark symbol of our mortality as human beings, and it also represents the wisdom we carry with us from this life to the afterlife. The snake weaving its way through the skull represents rebirth, transformation, and the creative force behind life itself. The image dances and pulls the viewer into a trance, and serves as a reminder of the eternal nature of our souls.\n\nLength: 00:01:00\nResolution: 1920 x 1080 pixels\nFormat: .mp4\n\nThe owner of this NFT is entitled to a 4k version of this video suitable for large scale high definition screens.
