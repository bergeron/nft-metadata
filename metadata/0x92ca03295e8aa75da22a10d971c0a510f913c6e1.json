    "description": "In 1952 Alan Turing wrote a paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis\" in which he described a theory of how patterns, such as dots or stripes, can arise in homogeneous systems under certain conditions.\n\nIn this generative art work a compressible fluid flow is colored and stirred by a multi-scale Turing pattern. A bilateral symmetry is imposed.\n\nThe colors are re-mapped by a function reminiscent of the \"solarization\" technique in photography.\n\nThe result is most definitely not an orchid.\n\nThis work is 8000 by 8000 pixels in JPEG format.\n",
