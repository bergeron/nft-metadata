    "description": "Confused Clown By Sepideh Sahebdel\n\nThe confused clown represents a human being who is like a puzzle and is put back together again, he has many secrets and sorrows in his colorful world and expects a bright future. Like all clowns, behind his smiling mask, he has a heart full of pain.  And he is sad.\nThis work emphasizes the theme of masks and how we hide our true feelings behind a facade of happiness, just like a clown.\nThe painting itself can be described as a complex combination of colors and geometric shapes that depict the image of a clown with exaggerated features.\nThe clown's face is partially covered by a large, colorful mask, which appears to be cracking and peeling at the edges, revealing the sadness and pain beneath.\nThis painting depicts the duality of human existence, where we present a face to the world while hiding our true selves behind a mask.\nUsing cubism and mixed media techniques, this painting shows the jigsaw-like, multi-layered nature of our identities, and how our true selves can be hard to discover.\nThe material used in the physical artwork is 50 x 70, cardboard, fluorescent and metallic acrylic paint, marker.\n\nMedia Dimension: 6600px x 4700px",
