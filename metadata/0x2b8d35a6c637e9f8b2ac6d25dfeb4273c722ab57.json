    "description": "Found Our Way is the first single following the Anton album. Written and recorded in California, featuring live bass, guitar, vocals, and synth. \nThe song was developed over two months and began as an acoustic strum. As the chorus and cadence of the lyrics came together, the bass lines and lead guitar work added a more profound sense of emotion. The music communicates a sense of togetherness, which is often present in the artist's work. The visual artwork features a photo from the artist's studio. The image was animated using the Retrospect and Adobe After Effects software applications. This song is the first release on the Bases Music smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum mainnet using Manifold. \n\nProduced by Bases  \nWritten and Recorded by Bases  \nMixed and Mastered by Tomás Shannon and Bases  \n\nbasesmusic.com  \npatternsagency.com  \n@basesmusic on social platforms\n\n",
