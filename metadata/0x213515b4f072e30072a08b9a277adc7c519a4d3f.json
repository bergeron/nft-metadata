    "description": "Title: Realm Of The Senses\nSize: 2840 x 4592 px\nMixed Media Digital\n\nFor decades, the symbolism of sacred interconnectedness - communions and human relationships have intrigued me. A shared set of meanings and collective vision. Our eyes have been so fixated with the outer perception that we are distracted by our materialistic culture. Blind to the inner sight. Always intrigued by the unlocking of the intuitive inner eye needed to find and navigate the visionary realm. This vision presented here seeks out that exact path. We realize that we are a part of a vastness more significant than ourselves in our own time.",
