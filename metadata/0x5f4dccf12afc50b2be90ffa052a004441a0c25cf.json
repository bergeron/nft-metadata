    "description": "This artwork features a stunning blonde body-painted ballerina in a black and white environment. It is not a black & white image when you look closer.\nI love using contrast in my artworks as you can easily see here. I also often use the color red but although her lips are bright red it has no leading role in this artwork.\n\nAs with all my NFT's making prints and even selling those prints is allowed for the owner of the NFT making it possible to earn back the investment and having more people enjoy the artwork. The right to print passes along to the new owner when the NFT is resold.",
