Goddess of Psychedelia Has Been Crafted With Love & Minted With Care. \n\nM3TA\n\n\n“It is no coincidence that a rebirth of psychedelic use is occuring as we acquire the technological capability to leave the planet. The mushroom visions and the transformation of the human image, precipitated by space exploration are spun together. \n\nNothing less is happening than the emergence of a new human order. A telepathic, humane, universalist kind of human culture is emerging that will make everything that preceded it appear like the stone age.” \n\nTerrence McKenna \n\n\n\n",
