    "description": "At its core, human identity is tied to our ability to think, feel and experience the world around us.\n\nBut what if we trained AI so perfectly that it will eventually mimic all human behaviors?\n\nThe artwork portrays the concept of what it means to be sentient, exploring the idea that, by teaching it constantly and extensively, AI could eventually perceive itself as human.\n\nIs it possible for a machine to attain the same level of self-awareness as a human?\n\nWe are heading towards a fully digitized life, where AI is taking over major human tasks, and WE are the ones helping it “LEARN”.  \nWe are teaching it how to “behave” and respond.\n\nSo if we taught AI to exhibit the EXACT SAME qualities we have, would it mean it’s developing a conscience or it is just programmed to mimic human behaviors and thought patterns?!\n\nCan AI truly understand its own existence and place in the world?\n\nMaybe…one day.  \nMaybe soon.\n\nBy looking directly at the viewer, the character bridges the gap between the robot and its own humanity, inviting us to see it in a new light and to consider the possibility that it is more than just a machine.",
