    "description": "Reconstructing Shunga in the digital horizon. Minimizing the flood of sexual imagery, and creating a new digital Shunga. Shunga are a type of ukiyo-e (paintings or woodblock prints) that depicted sexual scenes and nudity, predominantly popular in Japan during the Edo period. The term \"Shunga\" comes from the Japanese word \"spring,\" which is an indirect reference to sex, providing the origin for the name of this art form.",
