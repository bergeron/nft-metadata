    "description": "The Naiads, daughter of God, were living in the water that contained healing and prophetic powers. If that water is drying up, the Naiads would die. The Naiads were worshiped as fertility goddesses. The Naiads were also known for their extreme jealousy. It was told that a lover's infidelity was avenged with his blindnessâ€¦  \nIllustrations are painted with pencil, graphite, colored pencils and crushed gold leaf in oil on cardboard / grass paper.  \n",
