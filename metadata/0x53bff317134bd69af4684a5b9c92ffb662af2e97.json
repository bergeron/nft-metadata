    "description": "Hello!\n\nThere is a beginning to an end, and there is an end to a beginning. For some its a new start a fresh introduction for others its a finale, the final route the last stretch. My genesis began 2021 when I entered web3 and was able to be apart of a new start, that would change my life and many others. Coming from history in situations with platforms where I felt the foundations werenâ€™t so fair for the artist long term, I had to bank over and create new tactics & strategies that would only fortify what im building towards as an artist. \n\nI had finished my album FLOOR 11 at the time, while also creating a 4-5 track EP with DEFFIE, featuring some of my fav artists like MIA GLADSTONE as well as co production from myself. A fire was lit in me, that sparked my inspiration to write GENESIS as I hope this record can inspire the next person to embody that fire within themselves. ",
