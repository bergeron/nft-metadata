    "description": "A light glimmers in the night sky, illuminating the backyard of a quiet home. A sudden crash awakens the calm sleep of a Man, as he runs outside, unaware his life is about to change. Flashlight in hand, trepidation with every step, he engulfs the cool night air like water in the desert. His eyes grow wide, his light shining against the mysterious force that caused the crash. He cannot be sure, but what lay in front of him seems to be a thing only one could only dream. And yet, unless his eyes deceive him, there it lay. He inches closer, thinking if he could only place a hand against it, he would be sure it was real. With one last courageous breath, he bends down, reaching for the truth.",
