    "description": "I feel submerse, can't swim to anywhere. I'm surrounded by this creatures, they appear in my dreams, they want to take the life from me. \nFeeling emptiness trough all my body, I need to feel something. Life is not bringing me the joy of living, I'm underwater, cold as the seaweeds that don't let me go, I have my legs stuck, get me out of here, let me breath! My body is soaked, is this tears? Or am I still underwater?! Can't recognize me anymore, I used to live in hell and now it's just water... Bloody, cold, silent water, no lights, no sound, only emptiness. I feel the movement but I don't know how to reach it. Can you just please grab my hand?",
