    "description": "“N” for \"THE NEW AFRICA\"\n\nA rejection against stereotypes. A reminder of the power a continent of a billion holds. \nThe final piece of my genesis \"Portraits\" collection (OpenSea), I wrote this poem/song in 2021 inspired by the scenes I was seeing at home. \n\nYouth standing up, without slowing down, despite what happened at the gate of the Lekki Toll. (Nigeria)\nA man like Bobi Wine galvanizing the streets to try and challenge the throne. (Uganda)\nAnd witnessing the change in Ethiopia from \"this time will be different\" into the same contradictions we've always known. \nThe music was composed by me in collaboration with a producer. \n\n30% of proceeds will go toward social impact to build a better world jointly with MONOGRAMA.\n\nMy beliefs: Self-Awareness - Respect - Community - Opportunity\n\nArt: Jiré Saffron\nConcept: ©️MONOGRAMA\nEdition 1 of 1",
