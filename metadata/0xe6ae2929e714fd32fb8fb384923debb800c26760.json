    "description": "The lead-off song from the 2009 mixtape Penetration, \"PENETRATE!!!\" by MC Faceman is widely considered one of his most popular and well-received songs. The song first debuted live at the legendary Crash Mansion lounge in The Bowery, NYC. Although Faceman had been performing at select shows since 2006, this song expanded awareness of his music in the New York City underground hip-hop scene. His lyrics have been hard-coded into the smart contract for posterity.  \nProduced by Anno Domini.  \nAll rights reserved by MC Faceman.  \nHigh quality .wav audio file.",
