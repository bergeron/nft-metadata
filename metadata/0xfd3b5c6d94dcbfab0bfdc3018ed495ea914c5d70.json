    "description": "There is something about gazing at the setting sun on the horizon at the sea. The ocean stretches as far as the eye can see. Something so peaceful about watching the waves, eternally ebbing and flowing. I love photographing the ocean so much because the waves are always changing and create a different scene every time. It’s hard to envision this eternal ebb and flow in a still photograph, so I love how Shaun brought my photo to life with his animation.  As endless as the ocean, as timeless as the tides… Eternal Ebb\n\nPhotography by: Arwin Levinson\nAnimation by: Shaun Stewart\nType: 1/1\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
