    "description": "Jason O'Rourke Photography #1: Sandy Beach Wave\nJuly 2019 | Edition: 1/1 NFT\n\nWhile driving home from Kailua, I saw some powerful waves pumping at Sandy Beach Park. Mesmerized by the awesome shore break when \"Sandys\" is churning, I had to stop to shoot the barrels. When this wave exploded into my foreground, I was able to quickly refocus and capture the epic force of nature, a classic Sandy Beach Wave.\n\nJason O'Rourke is an award-winning wildlife and landscape photographer living in Honolulu, Hawaii. He has explored his island home to document amazing wildlife, landscapes, volcanic eruptions, and powerful waves now curated in this collection.\n\nHe volunteers with several non-profits that focus on education, outreach, and ocean conservation. In particular, he is known for his passion for Hawaii's endangered wildlife: Hawaiian monk seals, Honu, humpback whales, and Laysan albatross, while working to ensure these species are around for future generations to experience.",
