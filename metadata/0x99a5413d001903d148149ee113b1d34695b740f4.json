    "name": "Grandmother On The Mountain",
    "description": "Grandmother On The Mountain is a spoken word poem and painting by Adam Stewart. \n\n Music by Jason Reyes.\n\nIn honor of Aphee Saw. Aphee Saw was from the Akha ethnic group and lived in Ban Phonsavang which is located up in the mountains of Meung District in Laos. She is currently buried in a special Forest on the outskirts of the village.\n\nThere are a few cultural points in the poem I wish to share. You should greet your elders with hands pressed together and raised up to the face. Odotoma is an Akha greeting. The ending of the Poem is also Akha language and translates to \"I love you and miss only you grandmother.\" This is a special kind of love and respect given to elders.\n\nThe poem was written mostly in Laos but later translated and expanded upon in English to be what it is today.  To honor the rich oral tradition of the Akha people it has been memorized and shared as a spoken word without text. ",
