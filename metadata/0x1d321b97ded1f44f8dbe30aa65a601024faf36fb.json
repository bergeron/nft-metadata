    "description": "Southern Blue was created swimming around at one of the craziest waves on the planet, \"The Right\" located at the very bottom of Western Australia, some of the most powerful storms on earth are required to generate enough swell for waves to break on a gigantic underwater granite boulder. Only accessible via jetski or boat unless a complete lunatic, freezing cold water temperatures, an abundance of wildlife including Great White Sharks and powerful rip currents are the norm here. Swimming The Right requires a lifetime of ocean knowledge as mistakes are quite easily life threatening. The ocean out here moves in ways that boggle the mind, producing a sensory experience like no other. With the gigantic swells required for this wave to break, huge storms are generally prevalent on excursions to this wild place. Only on the rare occasion is there a day, when all of the elements align producing clean offshore winds and blue skies, making this extremely violent wave look almost perfect... This was one of those days.",
