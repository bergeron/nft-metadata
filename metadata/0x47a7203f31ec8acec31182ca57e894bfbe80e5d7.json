Resplendent with wrought iron, gas lamps, and masquerade balls, the past comes alive in this atmospheric composition celebrating the spirit of n0la.\n\nJ. Thorn has licensed n0la as CC0 or “No Rights Reserved,” waiving all rights to the work and placing the project as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance, and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.",
