    "description": "Sea of clouds - a phenomenon that captivates anyone who has seen it in their life once, but will continue to bring tranquility (and excitement) every time one sees it happen in front of them.\n\nIn frame is Two International Finance Centre, a 416m tall skyscraper and the second tallest in Hong Kong with 88 storeys.  Despite its staggering height, it only peaks above clouds a handful of times a year.  In fact, in 2021 when this photo was taken, this was the only time it was peaking with soft glow above.  \n\nThe first of the collection \"ABOVE\", this artwork \"Morning Glow\", is a 1/1 edition and holds a special place in the creator's heart as it had never been revealed publicly prior to minting as an NFT.\n\nThis moment was captured on 6 March 2021.",
