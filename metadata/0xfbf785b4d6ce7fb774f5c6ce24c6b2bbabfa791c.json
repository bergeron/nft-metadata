    "description": "\"Alone\" is a piece that represents how easy it can be to feel by oneself in a big city. I remember walking up the Queensboro Bridge path and as I looked left, I noticed a moody 1st Avenue and how busy it was. I saw the man waiting for his time to cross the road and knew this was the moment I wanted to capture. ",
