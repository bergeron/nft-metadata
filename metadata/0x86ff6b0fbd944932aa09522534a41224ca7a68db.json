    "description": "The trace left on the objects of our environment is invisible but very real. Each of us unknowingly leave a piece of ourselves. I focus on the most common object of our lives; the metal chair, used everywhere and in all circumstances. We put many things on them, our body of course, but above all a load or even an emotional overload.\n\nI demonstrate through my chairs that everyone has a direct impact on those around them. Every word, every gesture someone makes to another influence that we are. The chair here becomes a mediator to make us understand visually what the traces left by others on oneself can do, positively as negatively.\n\nMy installations and my works make palpable by our senses, the overload accumulated by these chairs. I make them talk, will you hear them?",
