    "description": "OCCULTED X SOTHEBY’S\n\nIkaro Cavalcante (Occulted) (1995, São Paulo - SP) works with 3D and sounds that reconstruct common spaces with their affective memory, be they virtual, such as games, or physical, such as lan houses. With these immersive digital installations—Perennial Links from the ongoing series Blood Connection (2021) It’s features blood, a fluid environment, chains, thorns, signs, a gateway, and a crystalized element—Cavalcante asks us to slow down, stretch, and amplify the archiving of traumas and the production of memories common in contemporaneity. The materialization of a prospective scenario of their autobiography in the format of notes on occulted things—the substance of their artistic production. Consequently, of their own cosmogony.\n\n.mp4 Format\n\n1 min video @30 fps\n\n1920x1920\n\nBlender, After Effects, Photoshop and FL Studio",
