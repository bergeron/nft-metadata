    "description": "The last born and most neutral of all three.  \nThe title is a symbolism of his outward reaction to the ongoings in the family, the numbness to his surroundings and closed off demeanor about the tension in their union.  \n\nHe’s that child the parents never have an issue with, he doesn’t lack love but at the same time the little things that matter are never at an arm’s reach even if in his heart, he’s a stagnant crawling mess of desperation & need with silent scratch marks that screams his brokenness, all which stems from the absence of equity.\n\nHe rages with himself in his closet but that’s all it’s ever going to be.  \nHe doesn’t talk much. He chooses not to express as it’s become his coping mechanism to stay sane in order to avoid confrontation or arguments as he’s never understood.\n\nHence, blindness is how he copes with the relationship between his brothers and his parents. The awareness of existence but feeling nonexistent at the same time.",
