    "description": "There is something about a layer of fog sitting low to the ground and the only way to truly see the beauty of the sunrise is to be above the fog.\n\nI have an unhealthy love for fog, whether it be a layer as seen here sitting at sea level or being deep in the mountains, perched on a peak watching a cloud inversion float by below me.  I search them out, nothing compares to watching the fog dancing below you.  \n\nThis shot was taken in Tacoma, WA above the Port of  Tacoma. A lot of my photography drone or camera on the ground revolves around this glorious mountain and it's surrounding peaks.  So much beauty with so little time.    ",
