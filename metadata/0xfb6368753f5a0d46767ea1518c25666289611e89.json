    "description": "\nWe humans are immersed in this city life, a city that our minds have made and paid for, and there is no escape from it.\nWe are trapped in ourselves.\nWe created the city, but it devoured us. This confused creature is becoming more and more complex.\nWe have embraced machine life and we are not willing to let it go. Our buildings are like castles where we are imprisoned.\nBut in all of this darknesses, there is still hope glinting for peace . This hope keeps the city alive. Hope for a door. A door to light and peace.\nMaybe the day will come that we finally open these doors with our own hands.\n\n\nSize: 3500 X 3500 (300DPI)\nDesigned by using Rhinoceros 3D, 3ds max, corona render, photoshop\n\n",
