    "description": "This is fanart of Stunna4Vegas (2019). Stunna and his manager label (Interscope Records) noticed it and contacted me to use this artwork in merch. They promised to pay for the work but decided to deceive me. Made money on my art lol. Printed and sell it. Also asked to create artwork for the new album but at the end it was same scammer story. This is first time when I see so much disrespect to me as an artist and my work. Let's see what's going on on future with these guys.\n\nFor the purchaser I'll send all documents and screens of this situation as exclusive content. Original art in high resolution, t-shirt and hoodie. Also we can discuss this situation on my Twitter or Instagram pages and maybe make some steps to justice.",
