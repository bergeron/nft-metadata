    "description": "The Australian Red-Tailed Black Cockatoo carries the spirit of female creation forces like a fire in the sky. In the Dreamtime stories of the Aboriginal people, the Red-Tailed Black Cockatoo links our current world to the ancient time of creation, a bird that plays a part of a wondrous cycle of rebirth and regeneration in the environment.\n\nThe sky is an integral element in Aboriginal culture, an entity of both knowledge and beauty that gives life to our world, represented in the painting with a vibrant array of red and blue tones. We imagine all the plants and animals that inhabit this world of colour and light, a wondrous spectacle of beauty, culture and life on earth.\n\nThe original canvas artwork by Luke Mallie - 60cm x 90cm (24 x 30 inches) - will be delivered with the initial purchase of the NFT.\n",
