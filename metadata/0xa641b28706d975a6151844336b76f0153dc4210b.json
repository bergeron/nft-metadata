    "description": "From time to time in our journey in this life, you might feel cornered.  An initial response might be a strong emotional reaction, symbolized by the red figure.  \n\nThe causes of this feeling might come from: a single individual with several demands, several people with their individual needs and expectations, or your own internal conflict.  These situations are symbolized by the blue figures. How will you respond?\n\n“Cornered” is the 1st artwork in The Journey collection.\n",
