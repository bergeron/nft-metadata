    "description": "It's that not easy as you see! I took 25 visits and uncountable hours in Kabani, Nagarhole forest, Karnataka, India to click this wild beauty...\n\nEach visit is new lesson, each minute is new experience. It's law of wild that if you see a tiger a minute ago, he seen you an hour ago! And it's true! It took more than an hour to click this pic as she was walking. I seen her a distance ago but each time she deny me a pic that I wish!  She is gifted this pic when she wished! \n\nShe gifted more than 20 pics but the pic I wished is of walking style that includes her full body and full posture, because, Head-on poses are always my favorite. And rest pic says.....\n\nEdition 1/1\nArtist: Avinash Rajendran",
