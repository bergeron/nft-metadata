    "description": "Date: 29 October 2020\nI spent 20 days in the wild to document the deer of Anatolia. I camped alone in forests full of deer and bears. It was the autumn season, which is the mating period of the deer. For days I listened to the roars and followed their tracks. This photo is from that first moment when we met eye to eye. We were both curious and excited. But it was also a little afraid.\n\nEdition 1/1\n2994 x 3742 px - 300ppi\nEskisehir Turkey\n\nLicense: The NFT owner is free to display it privately or publicly, including virtual galleries, documentaries, essays, social media accounts and print it for personal use.
