    "description": "There's a yearning for liberation that can only be satiated in private. By recording myself alone, I found the prowess to move and perform freely, capturing moments that wouldn't have existed otherwise. “Private Room” is a song about wanting to share that private liberation with someone. \n\nI had stopped making music for a while before working on this track. Changing my stage name from Eunice to YUNICE symbolize my recommitment back into being an artist. I moved to LA from Lisbon in June ’22 with four suitcases and my cat. Feeling the bear market struggles, I crashed on friends’ couches while looking for a private room to rent, and took the plunge into the music NFT scene. \n\nTB, a music producer who’s worked with major label artists, found me on instagram and wanted to work together. I was skeptical at first but took the chance and met with him. We clicked instantly on a profound artistic level. We wrote “Private Room” in our first meeting. It was almost too intense how much he understood my vocals and vision. I wanted dark and sexy and some cello, and we made just that. ",
