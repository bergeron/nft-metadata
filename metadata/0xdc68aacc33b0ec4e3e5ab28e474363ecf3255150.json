    "description": "\n\nFace as a concept is to be interpreted as a symbol of cognition and “the observer” mentioned above. What I mean here is the process of self-identification doesn’t work through looking at oneself in the mirror. It works through perception of non-self which is from “observer effect” standpoint should be differentiated from self. And this image of non-self being reproduced multiple times through different angles and perspectives repeats itself but at the same time changes. This duality allows the image to be recognized fuller and creates some sort of memory dimension.\n\nThe presented work is part of a series Temporarily Unnamed\n\nOriginal made canvas/acrylic/airbrush, 130 x 90 cm.",
