    "description": "From the creators of the smash sellout collection Scaredy Cubits Genesis comes the next generation of Cubits!\n\nDaz 3D and 3D art guru Misoo are back with Scaredy Cubits: What Scares You?, and these little Cubits are showing you exactly why they’re scared to bits.\n\nThe 3,131 NFT PFPs on the Ethereum blockchain have been so spooked by otherworldly ghouls, goblins, wraiths, and witches that they have turned into what they fear. Maybe it’s a curse. Maybe it’s armor, or a second skin earned by facing what scares them most.\n\nSo ask yourself, what scares you? And if you don’t watch out, you too might become exactly what you fear!",
