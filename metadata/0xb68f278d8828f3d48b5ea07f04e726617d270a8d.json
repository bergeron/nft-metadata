    "description": "This is a depiction of Farangis, a character in Shahname, an ancient Iranian epic by the prominent poet, Ferdowsi. Farangis was a powerful woman who lost her husband in a war against her father after which she tended to Siavashâ€™s ebony horse. She crossed a gigantic river with no one on her side but her horses, only to rescue her son, the legendary hero, Key-Khosro. The music of the work, in parallel with the series of events of the epic tale, resonates with the solitude of a woman, pursuit-evasion and the ancient patterns. In this music, some ancient instruments have been used such as Santur and Duduk. illustration by saba torkian motion design by delaris music by karang karbasi",
