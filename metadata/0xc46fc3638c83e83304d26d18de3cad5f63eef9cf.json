    "description": "This 3D burger is designed for those with an unceasing hunger for burgers. It is uniquely designed to provide you with a vicarious pleasure to palpably experience different layers of a burger in virtual world.\n\nThe idea behind this work is that you can materialize a work of art \"a burger\" from papers and colors only with a snap of your fingers.\n\nI called this work \"col-burger\" since it is made of color pencils. \n\nHope this work is satisfying enough to catch your interest and attention.\n\nThank you for your time reading this;\nFaranak Sattar",
