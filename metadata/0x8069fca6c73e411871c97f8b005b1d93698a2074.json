    "description": "Being a 13yo young British boy of Malagasy descent living in Seoul, I have discovered so many wonders that I wish to share with you all.\n\nKorea is the 13th country that I have travelled to. Two years ago, Seoul has inspired me to officially pick up a camera to capture all of the amazing facets I experience.\n\nWelcome to my new photography NFT series called 'LIFE IN SEOUL'. Come with me as I explore Korea and use my lens to demonstrate how I feel and why I adore living in Seoul.",
