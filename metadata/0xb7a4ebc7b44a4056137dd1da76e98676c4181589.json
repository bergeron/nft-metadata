    "description": "I saw the Photo of this valley (karakol) in Kyrgyzstan online back in 2018. Afterwards, it became my dream to visit the place and shoot it with my camera.\n\nIn may 2019, I went to Kyrgyzstan on a solo trip for 25 days to live my dream.\n\nKarakol valley was the first destination on my itinerary. I was excited & looking forward to the day but road to dreams wasn't always so easy.\nSo, some unexpected events and trouble were bound to happen. When I reached the city, bad weather and snow started. I was told not to go up there and stay in the town.\n\nI was really disappointed but i didn't give up. After 2 days of wait, I got lucky and started my dream journey.\n\nWhen i saw this mountains in front of my eyes, I got lost in that moment and realised that dreams come true. \nIt was such a magical and peaceful moment. That's why Nature holds a precious place in my life.\n\nComes with Physical metal print ( 36X24) inches on demand to the first collector.",
