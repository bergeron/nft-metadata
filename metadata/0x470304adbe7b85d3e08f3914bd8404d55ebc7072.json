It illustrates a moment of understanding that is discovered only once she opens herself up to the vibrant energy around her. It turns out she knew the answers to her questions all along.\n\nProject WANA is about discovering hope during dark times, looking inward, and growing together. We hope to lower the barriers to mental health care and support others on their mental wellness journey.",
