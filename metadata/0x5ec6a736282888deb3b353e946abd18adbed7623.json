    "description": "I woke up one day at my friends house on a cliff in the Bukit peninsula of Bali. The girls were doing yoga on the deck overlooking the ocean, it was a dreamy morning it felt like they were on a cloud with the ocean at their feet. I drew the concept on my notebook and later that day created this image with Marce, Cande, Sasha and Bianca.\n\nThis artwork is unique. It is the 1st of a total of 24 different pieces from the Imagineif collection. \n\nGo to journeytofreedom.world to know more about the project, the benefits and added value you'll get as the owner of this piece. :)",
