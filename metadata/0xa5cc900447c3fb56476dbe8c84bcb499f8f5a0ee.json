    "description": "Loosely based on African Masks, the art I make\nwith these \"faces\" have become a mode of expression for me.\n\nLately, I've been contemplating a lot. I feel trapped by certain situations and I have been chasing silver linings, hoping things will play out right. \n\nCaged reflections is a representation of that state of mind. The main face at the top of the cage signifies my ability to free myself from these \"cages\", denoted by the metal grills, yet someway some how, I'm still partially locked in. \nThe reflections signify the mental haze you enter when you're constantly thinking and assessing if things are right for you, if they are meant to be.\n\nThis is a 2160 x 3160 piece, and the collector will be airdropped a tricolore version.\n\nCaged reflections, Kingfikser, 2022",
