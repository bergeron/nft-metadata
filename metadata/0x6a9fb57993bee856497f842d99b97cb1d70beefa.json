    "description": "On this cold and frosty morning in Tochigi Prefecture, I was lucky enough to have the best conditions one could ask for. The way the light enters this tucked away marshland during late fall can isolate certain subjects turning the ordinary into something quite spectacular. The frost on these particular trees was a surprising bonus that made the entire moment and adventure one I will remember. \n\nAbout me:\nI’m Mark Davis, an landscape/nature photographer. I’ve had this creative fire burning inside me for as long as I can remember. I ignored or dismissed it for many years due to hustle and grind that was expected of me in my line of work. This all changed on one unforgettable hike that set ablaze my new lifestyle that has changed my life trajectory and my admiration for natural beauty this world has that remains untouched! \n",
