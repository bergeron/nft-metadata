    "description": "God is a Woman - Women are often recognised by the roles they play as Mothers, sisters, friends, some women are often worshipped as goddesses for the roles they play. Although she may play many roles to others, she is also a person of her own. She’s allowed to be faulty, she is allowed to make mistakes, grown and learn. She’s powerful if she chooses to make scarifies for others and still powerful if she chooses to not make these scarifies asked of her. \nGod is a woman, despite her flaws and her strength only grows everyday from pillar to pillar in this world we live in today.",
