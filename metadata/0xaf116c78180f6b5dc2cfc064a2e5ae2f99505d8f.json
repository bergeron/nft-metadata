    "description": "It is the year 1010AH (After Humanity). We are long gone. But life continues. The autonomous trains, buses, and cars created by us have become a new species that calls itself Mobility. We gave our vehicles a simple task: keep moving. They learned well, starting with our data and culture. Even after we ceased to exist, they moved. They evolved. The core philosophy of Mobility is Mobilism: the belief that life is motion.",
