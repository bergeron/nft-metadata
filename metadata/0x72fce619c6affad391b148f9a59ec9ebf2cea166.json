    "name": "To each his own cross",
    "description": "Picture To each his own cross about a person's faith in God. Someone believes for show, only creating the appearance of faith. Someone quietly being in the shadows, without showing it to others, simply thanks the Almighty. Someone goes to church every Sunday with his family, observes fasts and church holidays. But one way or another, each of us carries his own cross along the path of life.\n\nThe picture was painted in 1999. The size of the painting is 120x80cm oil on canvas. Participated in various exhibitions. Unfortunately, the canvas itself has not been preserved, only a photo has been preserved.",
