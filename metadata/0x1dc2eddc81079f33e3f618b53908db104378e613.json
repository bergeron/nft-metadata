    "description": "“And how do we take up space.\nAnd how of we fill these spaces, together.”\n\nThe focus is volume. How we enter a space, how we read and interact with the space and others in it.\n\nVolume is defined as the space occupied within the boundaries of an object in three-dimensional space. It is also known as the capacity of the object."
