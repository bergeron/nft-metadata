    "description": "This physical sculpture is now in the permanent collection of Los Angeles Community Museum of Art (LACMA). \n\nThe Patron  \nPowder coat on aluminum  \n43.5\" x 24\" x 16\" \n\nThis edition will remain open for 24 hours. All holders will receive access to a free claim. The claim will be announced on twitter and will have a two week claim period. No burns, we like the art.\n\nThe sculpture was commissioned by Cozomo de' Medici on August 15th, 2021, in the likeness of CryptoPunk 3831, and was included in the historic donation to LACMA as part of The Cozomo de' Medici Collection.\n\nThe sculpture is part of an ongoing exploration of the relationship between the digital and physical worlds. Physical sculpture, of digital assets, offers an opportunity to gain a new perspective and deeper understanding of the underlying work.\n\nIt is a thrill and an exciting milestone to be honored by a respected art institution such as LACMA. Many thanks to Cozomo de' Medici for his support, patronage, and facilitating this landmark donation.\n\nPlease contact me for commissions.\n\nFor process and portfolio: https://instagram.com/markgraeffe  \n",
