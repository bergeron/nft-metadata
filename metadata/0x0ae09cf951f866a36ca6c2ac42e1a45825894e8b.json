    "description": "e9Art - unhenged\n\n\ni am drawn to the mysterious and the mystical.\n\nit is where my imagination thrives best, on this playground of possibilities and what-ifs, filling in the blanks with wild fantastical speculations.\n\nstonehenge is the epitome of this. it fires my synapses. it sets my brain on fire…\n\nfor this is a place where magic and enchantment might still be possible, the very birthplace of fantasy.\n\ni hear it whispering its secret incantations into the wind, my imagination holds its breath and leans in closer, eyes ablaze with anticipation … \n\n\ndigital art by e9Art using disco diffusion and photoshop, May 2022",
