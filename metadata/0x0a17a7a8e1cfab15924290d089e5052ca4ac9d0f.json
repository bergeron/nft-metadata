    "description": "Motherhood changed me. The physical anguish and torture of growing and delivering life. An act of womanly reinvention, birth followed by rebirth.\n\nMotherhood is raw, it breaks you, scars your body, condemns your heart to forever live in fear of the greatest of losses.\n\nIt also transforms your mind and your perception of the world. It is a lonely journey, and a crowded one. A journey of contrasts.\n\nThe different textures and brush strokes in my painting signify these contrasts - this gruesome but wonderful state of being.\n\n“O what to me my mother's care,    \nThe house where I was safe and warm;      The shadowy blossom of my hair      \nWill hide us from the bitter storm” - W. B. Yeats \n\nAcrylic on canvas (2023)",
