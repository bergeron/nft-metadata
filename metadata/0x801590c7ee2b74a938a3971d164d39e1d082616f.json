    "description": "That day I made it to Le Buet - the birthplace of all Climbing, this little town is the most dangerous for the quantity of Avalanches and the place of the biggest snowfall and biggest snowflakes - It is hanged on the top of Chamonix Valley between Grand Montes and Switzerland. \n\nHelicopters constantly bombing the snow to control the passage of avalanches and there is a small amount of half hours that you can maybe make it there. From there I went up to the Swiss part of the valley. From very top I was stunned by Mont Blanc (centre right) surrounded by Ice clouds, Grand Montes wildness and its permafrosts with glaciers (on the left) , and Chamonix town.\n\n The sky was scrapped from its upper clouds by those massive rocks and It felt that this - will never be seen again in life.\n",
