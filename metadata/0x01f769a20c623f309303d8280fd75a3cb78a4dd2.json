    "description": "Remember Us IV (Watch Your Head) calls forth the story of Judith beheading Holofernes with digital reinterpretations of works by four incredible female artists across the 16th & 17th centuries: Lavinia Fontana, Fede Galizia, Artemisia Gentileschi & Elisabetta Sirani.\n\nAll four women depicted in their own distinct style the story of the heroine Judith who saved her city (Bethulia) from being destroyed by the Assyrian general; Holofernes. Our reworking of this tale highlights the power of women, drawing inspiration from a classical tale whose themes of equality, female empowerment and strength ring true to this very day."
