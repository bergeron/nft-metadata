    "description": "\"Women of the World\" is a work dedicated to women all over the world - young and old, sick and healthy, fat and slender.\n\nThere are only 0.5% fewer women on Earth than men, but it is women who store and multiply the warmth of the hearth, women are those who are able to give birth to new generations of people.\n\nWhite, swarthy, red, freckled, scarred, funny, thoughtful, brown-haired and fair-haired, mischievous and serious. All this is not important. \n\nWe need to be kinder and more tolerant of each other.\nWomen are the beauty and kindness of this world.\n\nPainting in a single copy. This is my author's technique - epoxy resin tubes. It took 1.5 months of daily work to create it.\nI showed all the women of the world with color, there are spots from freckles, and vitiligo, and moles and scars.\nYou can purchase the original of this painting. Size 100*100*8cm\n",
