    "description": "Drop 4 of 5. \n\nProduced by The Master Marc\nFeaturing Blakk Soul\nMixed & Mastered by Blakk Soul\nArtwork by Bayroo\n\nI made this song after my childhood best friend committed suicide. I spent years trying to find him to reconnect and only a few months after we did, he OD'd. I wish I had more control, I wish I had more time.\n\nMy brother Blakk Soul came thru with the feel I was looking for on the hook to round out the jam. \n\nEnjoy. ",
