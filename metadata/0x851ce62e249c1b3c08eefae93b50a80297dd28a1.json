    "description": "My Genesis on Decent. Free mint, for the culture. \n\nSMS is a Cubaton/Reggaeton song that came about after continuing to explore my roots and making Latin/Cuban beats. It's about blocking negative people out of your life, not chasing things that aren't meant for you, and attracting what you want out of life. I enjoy writing in Spanish for some reason but have also gotten into the habit of mixing English lyrics in and think I will continue experimenting and not limiting myself. Inspired by the people around me and the amazing web3 music community. \"All my homies on the blockchain.\"\n\nAcoustic, No Autotune.\nCubaton on the blockchain.\n\nThis token and all my releases will grant you access to my upcoming genwav website/music hub.",
