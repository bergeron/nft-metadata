    "description": "As a documentary photographer, I have been privileged to visit so many rural communities in Nigeria, West Africa. Recently, I visited Uzamagu, a rural community in Enugu and spent a week with the people of the community. \n\nAcross Africa, women and girls are responsible for collecting water in 80% of households which creates a gender imbalance that prevent them from things like work, school etc and that was the situation here in Uzamagu. The only difference is, the water is orange in color and not safe for drinking.\n\nFor these women, they will wake up as early as 4:30am to go collect this dirty water and carry the yellow containers on their heads back home. \"Sometimes I have to fetch water more than 4 times for it to be enough for my family\" Nne, the woman with the red top told me. They spend more time fetching water that their business suffer for it.\n\nMotherhood is about sacrifice.\n\nMy goal is to use the funds from this piece to build borehole to provide clean water for this community.",
