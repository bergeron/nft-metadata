    "description": "MY VERY FIRST NFT!  (✦ ‿ ✦)\n\nThis artwork is about embracing one’s mortality. Death is an inevitability that many of us have a difficult time accepting. The idea of it comes with fear and anxiety, but our impermanence is part of what makes our lives so beautiful and valuable. This piece also feels timely at a moment when we are reminded of our mortality so regularly and heavily.\n\n3200 x 4000 px",
