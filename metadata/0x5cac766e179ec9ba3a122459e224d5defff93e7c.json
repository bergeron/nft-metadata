    "description": "I know what you feel, “ He is so insensitive, always have that neutral and rude expression on face.” Maybe he never show the emotions that you deserve, maybe he doesn’t know how to express excitements like others , maybe he overthinks a lot and ends up making things very messy, maybe sometimes he need that affection but doesn’t say anything, maybe you thinks that he is not the same anymore or maybe he is the same and is not changing , maybe you think he doesn’t care , But sometimes he will show you that he is sorry for making things messy , he will tell about his life , he will ask for a lil bit support from you, he will fear to being rude in any way, he will be afraid to hurt you or lose you, He will sometimes tell you that He Cares ! \n\nArtist- Sahil upadhyay ( Yorkalakar )\nTool- Procreate \nFile format- png",
