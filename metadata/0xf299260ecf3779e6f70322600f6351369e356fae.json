    "description": "We are a small community of Ukrainian photographers and supporters helping to keep the memory of Ukraine alive. Itâ€™s difficult to send money to charity during these unsettling times, which is why we choose the indestructible crypto donation method. Our most meaningful photographs have been placed on the blockchain to raise funds for charity.\n\nPhoto 1/40.\n\nAuthor: @4ndrewmk\nLocation: Vorokhta, Ivano-Frankivsk Region\n\nLearn more at\n- www.indestructibledonation.com\n- https://twitter.com/ua_donation",
