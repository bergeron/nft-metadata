    "description": "\"Conceptual Disorder\" \nis an invitation to embrace the initial chaos and transform it into an enriching experience. Through its artistic representation, it encourages us to explore our ideas, thoughts, and emotions, shaping them into order to achieve a greater understanding of ourselves and the world around us. By finding a balance between disorder and order, we open ourselves to new perspectives, discover new beauties, and immerse ourselves in the journey with a renewed sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\n4320x5400\n2023\nBy criterio",
