    "description": "In a world where European colonizers were never able to conquer the Americas, indigenous peoples flourished and created modern societies influenced by their traditions and creativity.\n\n400 years after the iconic Matoaka led indigenous women to train as warriors to help eject foreign invaders, female descendants have grown stronger and more formidable with each generation. Today, they command as much power and respect as any man on Earth, and they are world renowned for their fortitude. \n\nTheir nation is a global superpower that is as feared as it is admired, with cultural influences that stretch around the globe.",
