    "name": "The Flighland Agaric",
    "description": "The Flighland Agaric is mighty tough. \nOnly the Elder Hina has ever beaten him in single combat; though she spared his life. \n\nAlong with his robustness comes the extreme flexibility of his Amalgam, borne to a Bubblegum body, he can stretch, bend, twist, and even repel attacks; all but the sharpest of swords or sparkliest of spells can pierce his elastic hide. \n\nHe's sturdy, swift, and deadly. \nWielding his ancient Xiphos Sword - an artefact doused in the blood of long forgotten wars.\nThe sword's story began in the hands of 1 of the 300 Spartshrooms; first used in battle against The Gharch. \nAfter the Spartshroom's defeat, it traversed the annals of history, passing from scavenger to soldier to son, coming to Britain in the hands of a Roman Porcinionary. \n\nThe Flighland Agaric killed the Porcinionary, and noting the fine quality of the blade, claimed it for his own. \nWith Gaelic Mushroom Sorcery it bestows upon it's owner the strength of 10,000 Shrooms.",
