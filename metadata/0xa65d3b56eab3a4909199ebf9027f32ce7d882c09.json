    "description": "In a time where man was no more favored by the Gods, man was deprived of the light. In desperation forced to abduct the sun, for they no more had the light that binds them, lingered in darkness for so long, long enough for their hearts to be filled with gloom, while all they ever wanted was just to bloom.\n\n2048 x 2732 | 300 PPI",
