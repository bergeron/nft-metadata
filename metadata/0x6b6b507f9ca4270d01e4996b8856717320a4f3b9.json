    "description": "\"Water! You have no taste, no color, no smell, you will not be described, you enjoy you, not understanding what you are. You are not just necessary for life, you are life. With you in the whole being there is bliss that cannot be explained only by our five feelings. You return to us the forces and properties on which we have already put an end to. With your mercy, the dried springs of the heart are again opened. You are the greatest wealth in the world, but also the most fragile - you, so clean in the bowels of the earth. You can die near the source if there is an impurity of magnesium in it. You can die a stone's throw from a salt marsh lake. You can die, although there are two liters of dew, if some salts hit it. You do not tolerate impurities, you do not tolerate anything alien, you are a deity who is so easy to scare off... But you give us infinitely simple happiness. \"  \nAntoine de Saint-Exup√©ry (novel \"Planet  \npeople \")",
