    "description": "We, as Adult Play, depict sexual diversity through arts. \n\nThis artwork is inspired by the story of Shiva who we've interviewed:\n\n\"I do not enjoy causing pain that much. I will feel guilty afterward. Instead, I prefer to put mental pressure on my partner.\"\n\n\"I did everything that was on my mind. I even did things that I found very difficult to say. When I have sex with someone, I want both of us to have a sense of mutual power. Most of my experiences have been in the form of emotional relationships. In this case, it is easier to say what you want.\"\n\n\"It‚Äôs important to me how much space I have [in the relationship]. If I feel I am with someone who doesn‚Äôt give me space, I won‚Äôt have fun. I need space to be able to talk about our interests. I don‚Äôt want him to say, Oh no, you are like this or that!‚Äù\n\nFrame by Frame Animation 3836*3836 pixels\n\nüìï The first owner will receive a free copy of [BDSM: 31 Narratives of Pain, Control, and Humiliation in Sex](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y3PTD3Y)",
