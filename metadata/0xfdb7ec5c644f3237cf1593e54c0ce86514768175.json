    "description": "Shirakawago is at its most beautiful in the winter. I found this breathtaking view of the Sho River on a bridge leading to Shirakawago. As I am from a tropical country, I never understood the beauty of winter until I saw this view. A certain kind of calm surrounded me as the snow fell, and everything that had color was drowned in white. It was as if the world was locked in a time capsule, and I had the privilege to admire it and preserve it in my memory.\n",
