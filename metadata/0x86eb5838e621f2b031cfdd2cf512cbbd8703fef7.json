    "description": "Introducing the 'Angelo Lagusa' painting, inspired by the main character of 91 Days. \nThis one of a kind piece captures the complexity and determination of Angelo as he navigates the dangerous world of organized crime. \nIn this scene I wanted to show all the emotions he felt trough all the anime: anger, sadness, guilt, determination, and fear. \nI wanted to put all of this into one painting.\n\n\n",
