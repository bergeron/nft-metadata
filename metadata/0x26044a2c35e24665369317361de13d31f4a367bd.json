Salisby was assigned a new name from the dark monsters group.  The dark lords wanted Salisby to be called by the name of “ Abuda Atta” .   The dark lords commonly used a secret language called the Juketauk language.  The words “Abuda Atta “ in the Juketauk language translated into English is “absolute authority”.  Salisby went along with the new name in the new adventure in a strange new beginning.",
