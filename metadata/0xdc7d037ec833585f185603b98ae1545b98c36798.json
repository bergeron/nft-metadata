    "description": "Iâ€™m sure we each have our own share of heaviness inside us.\n\nI pray one day or someday, you will find ways to take a breath peacefully without suffering from the burden you are carrying. Without feeling a sting in your chest while you breathe.\n\nI also pray the heaviness and emptiness you feel while trying to fall asleep will evaporate into the thin air soon, with your own pace. Perhaps you will not even notice their disappearance while living your life and you will be surprised that you suddenly know how to sleep.\n\nI pray the thoughts, memories and experience from the past/present that keep you in darkness will find their way out of you.\n\nOne day or someday, we will be alright.",
