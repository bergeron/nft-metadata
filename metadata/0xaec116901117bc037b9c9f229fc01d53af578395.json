    "description": "Sitting Alone in the Dark\nArtist: Jiamin Wong\n\nThe content of the picture is an open space where a giant lizard stands between sky and earth, a metaphor for the relationship between the body and society, sincerity and pretense, worship and contempt.\n\nThe body is intimately connected to the earth, and the gaze in the painting is directed around it, but also towards itself.",
