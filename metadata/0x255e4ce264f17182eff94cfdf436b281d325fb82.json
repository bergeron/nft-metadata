    "description": "This is the picture that inspired the whole project.\n\nStone, earth, paint, people, dirt, water, light, iron, wood, air. Every hand that touches the wall, summons little creatures on it so they can live there for a little time. Those layers and textures stack up and become a playground, a life itself. \n\nThis piece is from a wall on Urban Spree in Berlin. \n\n4206 Ã— 5789  Image shot with Leica M/P Type 240 w.
