    "description": "\"Love is God's first word, the first thought that floated through his mind. When he said: Let there be light!\" it was love. And he was content with what he had created, and he did not desire any of this uncreated. And love was the spawn of the world and the ruler of the world; but all its paths are strewn with flowers and blood, flowers and blood.\" \n- Knut Hamsun, Victoria\n\n30x25, canvas, acrylic, varnish. \n2 September 2020.",
