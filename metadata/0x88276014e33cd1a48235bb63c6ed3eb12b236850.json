    "description": "The Universe we live in is full of synchronistic geometry, ranging from tiny molecules to entire galaxies.\n\n\"Geometric symphony\" represents how everything that exists is perfectly orchestrated and harmoniously designed.\n\nGeometric patterns exist all around us, creating the fundamental structure and templates of life in the Universe. The patterns can be broken down into a language of mathematics that rules the entirety of our visible and invisible world.\n\nThe synchronistic way in which things are organized in the Universe show us how connected everything is and we are an integral part of it, a piece of a bigger puzzle, a result of divine orchestration.\n\nSoftware used: Blender, Adobe Photoshop\n",
