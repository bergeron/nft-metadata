    "description": "It's an eternal pain I can't get rid of.\nI feel like my life is slipping through my hands.\nI no longer enjoy watching movies, reading books, or spending time with people I love.\nI don't even know what caused this discontent.\nI just feel my soul slowly decaying.\nYes, my soul is decaying. And I feel it clearly.\nIf they grate my whole body, I wouldn't feel this much pain.\nI don't enjoy living anymore.\nI'm just waiting for the day when I will reach eternal darkness.\n\n\nResolution : 300dpi\nDimensions: 7087x8268 pixel",
