Just drop the songs damn it! \n\nWritten by DEEGAN\nProduced by DEEGAN & Kilo Sweeney\n\n\nLyrics:\nI ain’t tryna get lost in the promo\nTalk about the type of man who a no show \nLiving large yet I’m feelin so slow mo\nI’m feelin hot like I’m slipping in the ozone \nI don’t wanna live my life through a tv\nGive up everything just to be on repeat\nTell ‘em anything just so they can see me\nCopy everything just to be how he be\nPhantom on a bitch\nIma go phantom on a bitch\nI need fans to make me rich\nBut I need bands to make me rich \nTypa pressure make a man get up and leave\nPressure had me scared I couldn’t breathe\nPressure make fool right out of me\nI was somewhere I could never see\n\nRide longstyle like it’s limousine \nHeart pumpin pumpin like some creatine \nSmokin god damn trippin off the green\nParanoia had ya boilin off the heat I seen\n\nI been huffin cigs out the corner store\nI been off the shits outya modum bro\nI been makin stacks what’s the motive bro\nI cant believe you let the money do the dosie doe\n\nI ain’t tryna get lost in the promo\nTalk about the type of man who a no show \nLiving large yet I’m feelin so slow mo\nI’m feelin hot like I’m slipping in the ozone \nI don’t wanna live my life through a tv\nGive up everything just to be on repeat\nTell ‘em anything just so they can see me\nCopy everything just to be how he be\n\nI rock \nI roll\n\nTrippin out think I made my mama too worried \nHear me out I was hittin pounds in a hurry \nCry a lot just get the trial and the jury \n\nTrippin out think I made my mama too worried \nHear me out I was hittin pounds in a hurry \nCry a lot just get the trial and the jury \n\nI know\nYou’re Something special \nI know you want me to\nSomething special \nI know you want me to\nYou’re Something special ",
