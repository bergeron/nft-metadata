    "description": "This series, ILLUMINATED, explores communication beyond the reach of written language. We find feeling—and meaning—in the bright wash of an epiphany, in the sound of a companion’s voice, or in the design of a book. Words alone can do so much, but some things lie in the space just beyond them.\n\nThe characters used in ILLUMINATED do not belong to any language and are created using a typographic generative algorithm created for the Art Blocks Curated collection ASEMICA in 2021.",
