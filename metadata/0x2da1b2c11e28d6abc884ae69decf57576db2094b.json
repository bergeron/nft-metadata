    "description": "Passing through a mobbed funfair I noticed this mum staring at the Ferris wheel. It was if she was frozen in time as people flowed around her. When I gazed to see what she was looking at I saw her child alone in the wheel her gazed locked on to her mums.\n\nA snapshot in their lives; the wheel a metaphor for life. Sometimes standing back allowing an opportunity to build resilience whilst being there in the moment with them willing them to be ok.\n\nPaddy McDougall \n\nOctober 2022",
