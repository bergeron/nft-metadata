    "description": "The Elemental series is inspired by science that explores the concept of space through the fields of geophysics and biology. This exploration is envisioned with a body of abstract rock formations that represent the building blocks of creation. Forged using procedural noises that generate layered rocky patterns, each piece is a unique formation that creates a new element in petrology and mineralogy based on chemistry unknown to this world.",
