    "description": "As they set foot on the planet's surface, the crew marveled at the flora around them. The plants had strange shapes, some with spiraling tendrils.  But it was the red balloons that continued to draw their gaze, with their soft, warm glow.They floated among the plants, collecting pollen and distributing it from one bloom to another, ensuring the continuation of this incredible world.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, Superchief Gallery NFT x Exquisite Workers. 2023"
