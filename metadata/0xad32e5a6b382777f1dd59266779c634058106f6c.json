    "description": "Sometimes a drop of color is all you need to make the difference. The spot where I shot this photo is located in Bellagio and it's called \"Punta Spartivento\". It's a pretty popular scenic spot for tourists visiting the Lake, as it overlooks the Swiss Alps, so I was struggling quite a bit trying to frame a shot with no people inside. But then, this boy stepped into my frame with his bright yellow jacket and just made my shot ten times better.",
