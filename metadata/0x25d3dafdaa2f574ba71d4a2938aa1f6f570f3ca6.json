    "description": "Posted in 2017, the Irish predrink story video has reached over 70 million views across Facebook and Youtube.\n\nThe video depicts an Irish drinking song where one person tells a story with the crowd responding either positively or negatively after each sentence.\n\nThe video was recorded after a secondary school graduation in a park in Ireland. Since then, what was once an Irish predrinking chant has become a drinking song performed by people across the world. Across the world, many replica videos have been made and images from the video have been used regularly as memes on social media.\n\nwww.irishpredrinkstory.com",
