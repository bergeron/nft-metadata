    "description": "It's the year 3077. Human beings have devolved into apes once more. Blockchain technology developed in the early 2000s has given rise to fully autonomous, artificially intelligent sentients. With most of daily life now full automated, the pre-frontal cortex of the brain began to waste away. Ape like fascial features soon followed. The power hungry blockchain powered A.I. demanded an endless supply of energy, sacrificing the health of the planet to produce a radioactive wasteland.  This gallery features these ape waste products of the singularity. I quote... Our sole responsibility is to produce something smarter than we are; any problems beyond that are not ours to solve. Ray Kurzweil, The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology",
