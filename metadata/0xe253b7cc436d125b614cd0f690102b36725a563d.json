    "description": "«Unity» – our first digital artwork from \"SENSE\" series, created in collaboration with NOEASY. \n\nWe wanted to express our feelings about the meaning of the world \"unity\", which is now more important than ever before. We wanted to show, that everybody is equal. \n\n\"We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.\" – Charlie Chaplin, The Final Speech from The Great Dictator\n\nMost of the profit would be transferred to charitable organizations, helping those affected by war in Ukraine.\n\n-\n\n2000x2000\nPNG\nDigital painting",
