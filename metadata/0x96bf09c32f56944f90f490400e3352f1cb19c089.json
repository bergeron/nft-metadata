    "description": "This beautiful spot is located at the very northern tip of Cape Breton. I felt like I was exploring a very remote part of the island where few go and I really wanted to experience this remoteness and ruggedness that is typical to Nova Scotia. The view of the ocean and Bay St. Lawrence is breathtaking at the end. \n\nThe feeling that I had when I arrived was really special. It is extremely beautiful and rugged, and it feels very isolated, like youâ€™ve reached the end of the world. There is a narrow field that runs along the coast where several horses spend the summer. These aren't completely wild, as they are owned by locals who take them there to graze for a few months. But seeing wild horses that roam free, against the backdrop of the Atlantic ocean is really special. \n\nWild and free, just like the sea.",
