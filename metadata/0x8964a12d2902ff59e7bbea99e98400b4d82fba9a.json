    "description": "Behold \"Drokpa Diva, snapshot of youthful charm and timeless tradition. \n\nThis damsel is flaunting her traditional attire and larger than life headgear, her vivacity rivaling the vibrant hues of her dress.\n\nIt is not easy to dress up with the heavy silver jewelleries and the other accessories which carry equal amounts of weight and sit for hours long for a shoot but she was ever so delightful. \n\nHer gaze carried the depth of a river and each flower narrated a unique story.\n\nThis image was also showcased in the Dany2023 Beijing Exhibition â€œColors of Joy ''.",
