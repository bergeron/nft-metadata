    "description": "The Tangalooma Wrecks are a cluster of ships scuttled along the east coast of Queensland - Australia, between 1963 & 1984 to provide a safe haven for over 100 species of fish and sometimes even dolphins, wobbegongs and dugongs. \n\nNot only this, it provides a safe anchorage for small boats to avoid the fast currents that sweep through the wrecks. It is these currents that create the unique textured sands beneath which can only be appreciated from an aerial perspective. \n\nTangalooma is considered one of the pinnacles in Australia for aerial photography & I have been incredibly fortunate to travel here to view them in the translucent waters that Australia is renowned for around the world. \n\nThis NFT includes a physical A2 print should the owner wish to receive it.  \n\n",
