    "description": "Face Mask Lalibela explores the agency of neural networks in the study of material stages within the context of life-cycle assessment in the circular economy. It focuses on the use of GANs (generative adversarial networks) to identify new cradle-to-cradle opportunities within latent walks generated from life-cycle image datasets gathered from conventional take-make-waste processes of linear economy industries. It engages in the instrumentality of AI in recycling and closing life-cycle loops, not only in terms of proper post-Carbon waste management but also in potential manufacturing approaches. Specifically, it studies potential opportunities for COVID-19 face masks to be recycled as novel forms of plastics.  It prompts the use of 3D GAN techniques in animation industry-standard software through the translation of 2D GAN outputs into a dynamic 3D model, extracting volumetric features from digitally physicalized material stages.
