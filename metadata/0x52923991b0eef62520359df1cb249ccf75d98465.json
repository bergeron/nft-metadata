    "description": "I was lucky enough to watch the Golden State Warriors play during their last year in Oakland before they moved to San Francisco. The energy was electric and special, but also chaotic in the local transit stops nearby. I was able to take this photo amongst that chaos and with the Warriors no longer playing in Oakland, this piece can all the more be viewed as \"a special place in time.\"",
