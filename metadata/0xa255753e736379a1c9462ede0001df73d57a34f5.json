    "description": "Zarrin is my mother's name.\nAs a child, when my mother went shopping for bread and milk in the morning, I would wake up and see her vacancy.  I started to cry, and the only thing that calmed me down was my mother's tent or clothes that smelled of her.  I hugged her clothes and slept until she came back.  Over the years, I have photographed every city I visited, seeing women in white.  This feeling always takes me to my childhood.  That's why I named the collection \"Zarrin Mothers\".  The meaning of Zarrin in English id \"golden\".\n\n",
