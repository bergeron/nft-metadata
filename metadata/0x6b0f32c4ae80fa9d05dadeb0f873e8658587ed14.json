    "description": "This is my re-genesis drop and it is called 'The Phoenix'. \n\nA spoken word piece with animated abstract visuals, The Phoenix is a tale of self empowerment. \n\nI came into the NFT space as a visual artist, with a lot to say. And somewhere along the way I found a voice. I found community. I made a choice to do more for the community than for myself. My inner artist was sidelined for a while there, as I worked toward mentoring younger artists and standing up for artist rights and mental health advocacy.\nBut now it’s time for a Renaissance. \nI came in as a visual artist. I still am one. But I made a choice. I found a voice. I became a voice… and with that I now bring you my renaissance.. my re-genesis as Angad the artist. \nThe spoken word artist. \nThe poet. \nStill building community. \nStill doing all the things I’ve been doing. But just giving you a little bit more of me. \n\nI wish everyone who watches this a very empowered life. \n\nBecause.. empowered people empower people.\nWAGMI",
