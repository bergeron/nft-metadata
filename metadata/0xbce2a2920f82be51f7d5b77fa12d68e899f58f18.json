    "description": "originally the charachter is inspired by the song ‘Racing Into The Night’ the story of the song revolves around a man living alone in an apartment working for a ‘black company’ (a Japanese term referring to a job exploiting its workers) gets a LINE message from a woman who is his friend implying that she’s going to kill herself. He rushes home and finds her on the top of the building, standing on the edge ready to jump. He stops her and reveals this is the fourth time she’s tried this. She’s seemingly obsessed with death and constantly talking about the Grim Reaper. In an aside, the narrator mentions that the Grim Reaper appears to be extremely attractive to the person thinking about them. Unable to take this situation, he seemingly breaks down and reveals he wants to end it all…which prompts the woman to smile. Turns out, she’s the personification of death for him. They hold hands, and appear to jump together.",
