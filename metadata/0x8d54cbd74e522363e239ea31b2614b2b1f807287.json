    "description": "Silencio Presents “Saudade” from The Athena Dreams Collection\nThe Goddess Athena dreams of a love lost, or perhaps never found.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Saudade is a Portuguese word that cannot be easily translated into the English language. It is a deep emotional state of melancholic longing for someone or something that one loves or desires, which is absent or might not even exist. In this dream, The Goddess Athena is surrounded by memories of a love that may or may not have been real.\n\nNOTEWORTHY: Silencio has included some highly personal items from his real life, as well as a Memento Mori medallion and a secret embedded image from his childhood which is not visible to the naked eye. This piece is also one of the few in this collection where The Goddess Athena has some part of her face obscured, making it one of the rarest works in the series.\n\nDETAILS: Surrealism photomontage created in Photoshop; Editions = 1 of 1; Image size = 5000 x 3333 pixels at 300 DPI; Format = PNG image\n\nSurrealismo!",
