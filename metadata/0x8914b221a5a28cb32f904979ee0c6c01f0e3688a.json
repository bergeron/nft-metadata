    "description": "The vapor jellyfish was discovered on planet Gliese 1214b, during the Ophiuchus Expedition (2018-2022).  The vapor jellyfish is almost entirely covered in light producing organs, capable of producing flashes of light from blue to yellow.  The intensity and duration of flashes can be modulated.  Repeating patterns have been recorded and are hypothesized to be a form of communication.",
