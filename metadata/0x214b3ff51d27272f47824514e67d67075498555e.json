    "description": "Art inspired from a photograph I made back in February 2019 at Macao Beach, Dominican Republic.\n\nThe sun was setting, and the reflection of the sun in the sea bathed the entire landscape in gold; even better, the reflection helped to create the ideal silhouette of the fisherman standing on the rocks.\n\nI used a texture to make it look like a canvas, then added a layer of digital paint with a medium Brush and 0.75 paint volume, added some Glow, then played with with Precision Contract and a 60% Vignette.\n\nAG",
