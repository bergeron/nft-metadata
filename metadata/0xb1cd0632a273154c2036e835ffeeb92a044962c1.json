    "description": "Burn It All Down is very much a piece about lamentations and mourning loss. \n\nIt was originally painted on a 16\"20\" canvas. \nThe gestural automatism base was made by mixing various acrylics and alcohols over a multitude of layers. It is overlapped by violent and contrasting light colored action paint strokes created by an assortment of strange tools including zip ties, screwdrivers, bmx chains, and phalanges. \n\nThis painting is the result of letting go of someone that has caused a world of hurt. It goes through the processes of chaos, anger, mourning, and eventually recovery and peace. It is about being content with your past, your mistakes, and eventually yourself.",
