    "description": "Norman Harman has strayed further & further from the motel to pluck the outgrowths of the glitched & morphic wastelands of SIGHTSEERS and offer it to collectors as the exclusive Perimeter Town set. \n\nSIGHTSEERS, Norman Harman's first serial collection, created a world that goes to the roots of both the cryptoart movement and of humanity's current historical crossroads. Based on the sightseers who came to watch the nuclear bomb tests that took place in the desert outside of Las Vegas during the 1950s, the landscape is populated with blithely doomed figures. Against this backdrop, Harman invokes the cataclysmic potential of a new technological frontier: AI. \n\nPerimeter Town is the result of Harman's work in the months following SIGHTSEERS, a boutique set that reveals the refined emergences on the perimeter of the SIGHTSEERS world.",
