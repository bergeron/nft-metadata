    "name": "Collaboration with Lisanne Haack ",
    "description": "This is the first collaborative piece on the Bloomie Collabs collection. It was made together with Lisanne Haack - Twitter @paranoidhill. We have a long history of sharing and appreciating each other's artistic journey, so I am very proud to have our collaboration as the genesis piece.\n\nLisanne is an abstract painter who uses dynamic strokes and expressive shapes to create many immersive pieces of hers. The colors she uses are natural and often soft in how they appear. While collaborating with Lisanne my purpose was to incorporate a trademark figure of mine, which is a primitive animal. During my part of the collaboration I didn't want to demolish the original abstract nature of the painting. I have merged our styles together so it would look like a seamless painting. \n\nEnjoy the piece and Thank You for your attention!\n\nArtwork Size: 4960x3506 px\nTools: Lisanne - Art Set, Justas - Photoshop\n",
