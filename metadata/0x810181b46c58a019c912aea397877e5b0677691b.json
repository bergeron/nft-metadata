    "name": "Bliss - Of the Moon and the Star",
    "description": "Moondust on her shoulders, kissed by a star-gazed sky, she sat there for hours, savoring the euphoria her skin had felt and her soul had soaked in for what felt like infinity in a moment - it’s her secret and the night’s - so she whispered to the moon her first taste of bliss!\n\nArtist: Swati Chakraborty\nEdition: 1/1 - Photograph\nDimension : 3919× 6619 px\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n\nArtist Bio:\nI met my grandfather through a photograph. He sits there in a sturdy piece of black-and-white paper, holding a two year old me - my only proof of ever having received any grandfatherly love. As I veered from photographing for pleasure to choosing it as a profession, this black and white photo stuck with me - reminding me how photographs can turn moments into memories. This is perhaps why I am drawn to portraits. All the people and their stories that I get to know during my photographic sessions inform my social vision and fire my creative imagination.",
