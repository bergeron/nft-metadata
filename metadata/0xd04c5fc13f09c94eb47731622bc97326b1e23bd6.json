    "description": "The Great Horned Owl at 100 Seconds is one of my most mind blowing pieces of work.\n\nThis image was capture at 4am, lit only by moonlight. It was too dark outside to see an Owl but I could hear one in the direction I was looking to shoot.\nShooting at 100 second exposures to light the scene left me thinking that it is probably impossible to capture the Owl sharp. It was too dark outside to know if anything was properly focused and when shooting in the darkness everything is manual.\nTo my surprise in just this one frame it appears to be locking its eyes right back at me for the entire 100 second exposure.\nIt was 15* degrees Fahrenheit outside on this night, I was standing on ice as I took this photograph.",
