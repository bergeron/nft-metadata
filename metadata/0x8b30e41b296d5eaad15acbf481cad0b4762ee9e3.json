    "description": "Created in collaboration with [amazeuxe.eth](https://foundation.app/@amazeuxe) and [Psycho Boys Club](https://twitter.com/PsychoBoysClub).  \n\nThe year is 2069, silicon shortage is running at a pace that has put the rest of the world on the brink of bankruptcy. Adaptive silicon design with minimal and light technology will create a new manufacturing environment, creating a new industry in which new products become available, not just in factories but in consumers' homes everywhere.  \n\nFollowing the ever-rising consumer demands for blockchain-connected devices, this new technology is designed to provide a new avenue for companies to invest in the industry. Polymorphic circuit boards, as they call them, are already available from some of the most prominent manufacturers that currently manufacture high-performance electronic components.",
