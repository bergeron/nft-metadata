    "description": "What has the power that makes the souls of viewers moved? The distinction of life and matter, or that of subject and object has been dealt within the various criteria. So there can be no fixed objective for the criteria, and there can be no pure subjective ones, either. What we can be sure of, however, is the criteria can have profound influence on the relationship between human beings and natural world. The idea that nature has soul or its own power is likely to be rejected or laughed at especially in this rational modern world.  But can we say that we are so reasonable not to have such a foolish idea? I got to have an idea that before we judge the landscape subjectively or objectively we should understand why we see the world in the such a way at first.\n\n  My representation of nature as landscape photography is to reject the distinction and make a passage based on the reflection.
