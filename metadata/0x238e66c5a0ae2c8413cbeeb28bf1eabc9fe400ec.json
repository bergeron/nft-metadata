    "description": "The district of Butuceni, Refugium peccatorum of pilgrims on their way to the monastery of Orheiul Vechi, is made of turquoise tones, traces of distant sands, wooden gates, abandoned buses full of hay, hanging baskets and quiet inns.\nThe image captures young Rari nantes in vast gurgite, perhaps seeking attention or perhaps simply intent on expressing their childhood, devoid of thoughts, pure and expressive.\n\nThe photo is part of the META EST photography project, 2018.",
