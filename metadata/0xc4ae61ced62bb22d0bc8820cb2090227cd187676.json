    "description": "is all about visualizing my thought into art , i was wondering \"is freedom real?\" \n\nhere's my thought :\n\nThe concept of total freedom certainly does not exist. the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe and are subject to the laws of physics, suffices as a limiting factor. And of course, we are human beings who are limited by our five senses and influenced by our biological and psychological makeup. In addition, we are also influenced by the environment and society in which we grew up.\n\nNot to mention the influence of the attitudes and economic conditions of our parents and primary caregivers.  \nAll this causes the concept of freedom and freedom to be said to be non-existent. In fact, at birth, we are already experiencing forms of external identification and categorization that may actually conflict with how we feel about ourselves and the way we see ourselves.First of all, our names, as we know them, are assigned to us by the whims and idiosyncrasies of other people, and we don't necessarily like those titles.",
