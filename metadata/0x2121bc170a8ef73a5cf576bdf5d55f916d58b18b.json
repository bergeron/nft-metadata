    "description": "I am a creation of Dark Matter\n\nA symphony\nof bad habits\n\nA cacophony\nof delicious talents\n\nStabilized and undermined by my cycle of disorder\nineffebly self destructing, painfully unperceptive\n\nLimited by the needs that make me feel free\nFreed by the limitations that make me feel needs\n\nWhat?\nMight as well keep that there.\n\nDark Matter.\n\nCan you hear me?\n(i’m yelling in my mind)\n\nCan you speak softly?\n(for my fragile heart)\n\nCan you hold me?\n(no, I mean, really. Hold me)\n\nCan you watch me?\n(fall on my sword again and then again)\n\nDid you say yes?\n(nevermind don't tell me)\n\nDark Matter.\n\nWelcome to the Infinity Residence\n(this is my home)\nHave you ever been this deep?\nI am deeper still.\n\nTethered by titanium tightropes\n(this is my hope)\nShould we stay this close?\nI am closer still.\n\nDreams of sparring silver tongues\nTell me why there’s a tightness to your lips?\n(this is my trust)\nI am tighter still.\n\nI’m on to something here\n\nDark Matter.\n\nCheers to you!\n\nLove\n\nTo your Dark Matter!\n\nTo blissfully transmute with enchanting benevolence\nYou make it look so easy (so good too)\n\nI stumble often and skid my knees\nJust to wallow in the wakes of wreckage\n\n\nDark Matter.\n\nTo losing, love!\n\nAll objective sensibility\nAll cloaked loneliness\nAll overwrought escapism\nAll clairvoyant capability\n\nBecause\nWhat the\nFuck!\nDark Matter.\n\nI’ll be the one\nRefusing the lifevest in hopes I drown\nIn infinite and unconditional love\nTo be engulfed by an ocean of darkness\n\nThank you, love!\n\nFor casting illuminating beams across the galaxy that is me\nStill, so much remains to be seen\n\nCosmic uncertainty\nExpansive emptiness\nShadowed serenity\n\n\nWe depart, we return\nWe cease, we remain\nWe bury, we exhume\nWe sow, we reap\n\n",
