    "description": "So, do you travel a lot? Where have you been?\n\nWell, I take selfies in every part of the galaxy.\n\nTOI-700 d is a near-Earth-sized exoplanet, likely rocky, orbiting within the habitable zone of the red dwarf TOI 700, the outermost planet within the system. It is located roughly 101.4 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Dorado. The exoplanet is the first Earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TOI-700 d orbits its star at a distance of 0.163 AU (24,400,000 km) from its host star with an orbital period of roughly 37.4 days, has a mass 1.69x times that of Earth, and has a radius of around 1.19 times that of Earth. It has been estimated that the planet receives about 86% of the energy that the Earth receives from the Sun. It was discovered in early January 2020 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).",
