    "description": "Childhood should be a time and a place of imagination and wonder. It should be made up of moments of joy and learning; of climbing trees and running barefoot, playing in the mud and splashing in puddles.\nAs a mum to 5 and a foster mum, in addition, this alongside my work as a mental health specialist, I see ultimately that these vital elements of play and simplicity are missing from many children’s lives.\n\n This painting is there to reminders to create a world where imagination is celebrated and encouraged not just for our young people, but for all of us - where inside all of us there is a place that if we jump so high we feel like we’re flying.\n\nNow go outside and jump in some puddles !",
