    "description": "I live at one of the highest elevations in my area. Specifically, at the base of the highest peak in MA, Mount Greylock.  When the weather is right, thick morning fog settles in the valley towns and around the small hills molded around the mountain.\n\nAbove the shelf, the view warm and serene. \nBelow, downtown, is dark and damp.  \nCompletely different worlds, just a mere 2,000 feet away from each other. \n\nOn the days when this occurs, you can drive into town and hear a plethora of folks bothered by the “bad weather” (I’ve found it incredibly common that people will not only let the weather determine their mood, but also feel compelled to complain about it), having no idea that this cloud cover will burn off within the hour and sunshine will follow.  \n\nI wrap myself in gratitude, selfishly smile and think about light that started my day: the golden sunrise above the fog layer, the misty fingertips of the shelf curling around the trees, the glowing optimism of a new day.\n\nImages like this are so much more to me than a pretty scene; they’re a reminder that perspective and mindset are everything. \n \n",
