    "description": "We sat in a golden plain on top of a mountain. The purple lake is in front of our eyes and we watch the scene of embracing the water and the plain.\nThere is a strange silence in the space.\nIn such a way that the sound of water kissing when hugging the plain can also be heard.\nI put my head on the wings of my dragon and my body is buried in the body of the plain.\nI look at the blue sky above me and the planet earth portal is visible in the distance. \nWhen I calm down, I close my eyes and through the portal of my mind planet immerse myself in the beauty of this endless world of imagination.",
