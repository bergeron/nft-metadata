    "description": "The Greek tales of old chronicle Medusa as a monstrous beast, hair of snakes. Yet, some recounts describe her as an alluring beauty. Her enigmatic nature continues with a name which means “guardian”, but a reputation that’s quite the opposite, striking fear into even the bravest of heroes. With a gaze that can petrify any living creature that falls prey, it’s no surprise that her physical appearance remains contentious. The mysterious Gorgon comes to life in this collaborative piece by JPK and Mighty Jaxx. Taking a two-prong approach in the reimagining, Mighty Jaxx designed and sculpted the Medusa figure with a hair full of snakes. JPK works his magic, highlighting her story through a series of full body tattoos; her lover, Poseidon, slayer ,Perseus, and common depictions in historical artifacts. This is the secret of Medusa, unveiled.",
