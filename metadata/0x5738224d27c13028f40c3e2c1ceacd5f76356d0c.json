    "description": "1/1 (1440 x 1920 px)\n\n\"The PORTALS - KINESIS - Matterhorn, 10.4.21\" is a 15-second video segment documenting an installation of The PORTALS in Colorado on October 4, 2021. In this piece, the PORTAL remains still as the environment around it is in constant transformation. This NFT represents one of infinite timelines & patterns that were possible in this place, at this moment, at this time.\n\nThe PORTALS, an ongoing installation artwork series, began in 2020 with the intention of connecting people to place. Each portal is an invitation to experience the now while simultaneously considering our inevitable transition elsewhere. The PORTALS sculptures are created in studio, and then transported & installed as site-specific, environmental installations. The audience is invited to locate & experience the installed work in remote locations throughout the world as well as collect the series which includes sculpture, NFTs & high-resolution archival prints.",
