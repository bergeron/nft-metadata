    "description": "We draw a girl in the rain of war....\n\nBecause of the war in Ukraine, these youngsters have become orphans. Some of their parents were brutally killed in the ongoing battle on the Russian border, and they now have nothing or no one to return to. \n\nWar trauma is a part of their life, and it has left such an indelible mark on their minds and bodies that it influences their behavior and the ailments they experience. The trauma is now compounded by the recent dramatic experiences they have had as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n*A portion of the proceeds from NFT will be donated to UNHCR.\n.\nKind : JPEG image\nDimensions : 2480 Ã— 2480 | 1:1 ASPECT RATIO\nColor space : RGB\nColor profile : sRGB IEC61966-2.1",
