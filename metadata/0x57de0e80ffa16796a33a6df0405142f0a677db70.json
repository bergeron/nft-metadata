    "description": "Early in 2021 Ocean Culture Life storyteller Jono Allen asked us to support him on an important storytelling journey which would eventually lead to setting up Fuvahmulah Marine Foundation, alongside Nasheed Ahmed in order to help protect the local community and marine site on the island of Fuvahmulah. ⁠\n\nFuvahmulah Marine Foundation is a locally driven non-profit dedicated to protecting and conserving the pristine marine ecosystem that surrounds the Maldivian island paradise of Fuvahmulah.⁠\n\n⁠As major challenges surrounding plastic waste, shark diving safety, and respecting the local dive community increase FMF helps to facilitate sustainable change through sourcing issue specific experts and local authorities while physically directing and overseeing projects on the ground with the local community.⁠\n\nShark Tale is the first image from a set that will be help support FMF through investment and updated content creation into 2022. \n\nIncludes physical fine art signed print. \n\n",
