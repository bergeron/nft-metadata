This is when the Flower fairy emerges from her slumber to complete her duty. She has to breath life onto new flowers with her powers to do so.\n\nWhen the period of blossoming is fully over and her job is done, the Flower fairy goes back to where she came from. She sleeps to replenish her energy until she is needed once again.\n\nNothing gives her more joy than knowing that everyone will love the flowers she helped bring life to. And because of that, she can sleep peacefully.\n\nThe BiBi collection is a series of 3DCG artworks with the themes of 【Fairy Tale】\n\n2000×2000px\n105frames",
