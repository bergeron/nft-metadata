    "description": "Oeste is a body of work made on the outskirts of Hermosillo, Mexico, the city where I was born. \n\nI remember going on long drives through these highways with my family when I was a kid. I always wondered why there were so many crosses with names on the sides of the highway, the feeling was very similar to what it felt to walk between the tombs of a graveyard, a sense of quiet contemplation on a landscape that seems to belong to the dead.\n\nIn Oeste, I walk through these landscapes and think about the way the places we inhabit will look when we are long gone.
