    "description": "To meet the inner child and learn survival skills from her, the inner adult found her childhood photos and sent herself back in time through  a collage with a baby photo. The little girl in the photo had just gotten up on her feet for the first time and was screaming about it. The adult came back  in an old photo to learn how to scream. I created this artwork for an exhibition at the All-Russian Decorative Art Museum, Moscow https://damuseum.ru/event-calendar/?exhibition=12 called \"The Art of Living: Tradition and Design.",
