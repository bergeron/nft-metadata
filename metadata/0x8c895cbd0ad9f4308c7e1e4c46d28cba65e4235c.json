    "description": "Actually we do not know ourselves because our perspective on life is the perspective of the child that is always hidden inside us. Like the umbilical cord, it nourishes our lives from the past to the present. It makes us feel happy or guilty. What if it gets stuck in our throat and prevents us from breathing? You can only untie this bond when you are aware of it. Then the stars in your eyes begin to shine.",
