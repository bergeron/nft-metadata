    "description": "We live in a fast-paced world, and it often seems that our brains can't handle things anymore. When this happens, it is a sign for us to take a step back and relax. Our bodies, minds, and souls all need a short hiatus at times before moving forward. This piece is dear to me as an artist as it reminds me to take care of myself when I feel burnt out, take a deep breath, and know deep down that it will get better in no time. ",
