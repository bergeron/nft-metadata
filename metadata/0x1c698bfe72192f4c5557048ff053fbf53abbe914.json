    "description": "'Mutual' by Moodsoup investigates the concept of (non-)duality, visualised by a triptych of interdependent outputs. This generative artwork consists of three distinct visual representations — the ordered, excited and interaction state — sharing a connection to a primary framework from which they cannot be detached. Although separate manifestations seem to exist, they all emerge from a common fundamental substrate. They are not disparate but are anchored to the same underlying structure. \n\nThis artwork is the carefully crafted and selected output of a generative algorithm. Upon request, the NFT is accompanied by a unique 1/1 edition physical plot. The pen plot is 420mm x 594mm, black archival ink on A2 220gr white acid-free paper. It is the sole responsibility of the seller and buyer if the physical plot is included in the sale on the secondary market.\n\nHi-res 4800 x 6789 px PNG\nMade with javascript, p5",
