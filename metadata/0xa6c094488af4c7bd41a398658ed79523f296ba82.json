    "description": "Transient Light is a visual metaphor of the artist's relationship with the origin and impermanence of all things. Each rotation of the disc opens a momentary window into a different corner of the artist's universe. Some of these glimpses into another dimension are linked to future or past artworks, reinforcing a theme that is at the core of the artist's practice: \"Everything Connected\". The refracting light permeates the scene bringing different emotions to the surface and highlighting the concept that many different outcomes can flow from one source. Although in this specific context we're talking about light, the artwork leaves the door open to the idea that this principle can be adapted by the viewer depending on the individualâ€™s personal circumstances.",
