    "description": "Based on the Portrait of a bearded Man with a Ruff by Frans Hals from 1625\n\nPortraits from the Dutch Golden Age always impress today with their powerful, seemingly simple structure. At that time, simplicity and modesty were socially required. But people still wanted to show their high social position or success (a human trait to this day). So if you had a portrait painted of yourself, that alone a sign of great wealth, it definitely had to be in black clothing. \n\nBlack fabrics were incredibly expensive, they shimmered discreetly but for all to see, proving their preciousness. And the fine white collars were a sign of belonging to an elite, the bigger and fluffier the better. I ironize this collar, duplicate it and individuality disappears behind this status symbol. The special feature of this portrait is his hand on the heart, a fond gesture to us. I wanted to preserve it, even emphasize it. That is why an eye is visible, as an indication that the sitter turns very directly to us.",
