    "description": " Humen feels only space and matter. That is, we feel only part of the environment around us. We don't know the time.  We don't see it. In this collection, I am trying to imagine what the distortion of space-time would look like for the human eye if we could perceive a single, in fact, dimension, without dividing it artificially, or in an evolutionary way, into visible parts and not visible to us. \n\nThe works, if carefully considered, give vent to the imagination.\nTechnically, the texture is based on watercolor diffusion. Subsequently, this product of an actual physical process is transferred to the digital world, where it is changed, supplemented, and completed.\n\nAmong other things, I wanted to transfer the physical properties of real old paints into digital art, not just as a processed photo but as a living participant in the process that adapts and interacts with the new one.\n\nThe owner will be given a link to the jpeg 26942x32000px of this work",
