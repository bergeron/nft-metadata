    "description": "City of The Fallen, depicts the boundless colour of childhood innocence and the darkness and disillusionment that creeps in with coming of age. There is a numbness that comes with being adult, the binding of joy with the pessimism and cynicism that comes from experiencing hard lessons and struggling to learn from them. We grow accustomed to fear and comfortable with not being happy. We settle down and settle up for what reality presents. We allow the world to rewrite our journeys and worth and stories. \nWe are Fallen, not from heaven but from the grace and bliss of innocence.   ",
