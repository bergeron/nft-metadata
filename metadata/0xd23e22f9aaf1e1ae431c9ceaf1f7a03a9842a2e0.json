    "name": "The Face of Anxiety",
    "description": "Birds without eyes. A man without a face. But some eyes do look at you. You see them, don't you?\nThis art is very special to me. It was drawn without a clean sketch, and even from a rough sketch here there is only an idea. The art was born in the process.\nIt's a kind of art therapy for me. I found out about a relative's serious illness, and this feeling overwhelmed me. I can't cry, otherwise it would mean that I accept this reality. And I don't want to, and I can't yet. But at the thought of it, I go into a panic. Anxiety sweeps everything in its path.\nAnd here I stand, a scorched little man, and the anxiety is so huge. I have generated it, but I don't know how to deal with it. I hope you haven't and won't encounter something like this.\nBut if something is troubling you, then there is something you are afraid of losing. The light is there. He is the eyes of my anxiety. \n\n1/1 Art by Anna O'Neill \n3500*5250px 400dpi",
