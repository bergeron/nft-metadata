    "description": "Tyler Cowen is an American economist, columnist, and blogger. He’s also a professor at George Mason University, where he also produces the Conversations with Tyler podcast with guests like Vitalik Buterin, Marc Andreessen, and Ray Dalio.\n\nIn this episode, Tyler shares why he thinks regulators should pause and wait before passing crypto regulation in the wake of FTX, how FTX and Enron are similar, why he calls himself a crypto-hopeful (*even though he thinks Balaji’s Network State idea is utterly wrong*). \n\nAnd finally, we play Tyler's favorite game—Overrated vs. Underrated—about everything relevant in 2023: Crypto AI, Inflation, America, China, Social Media, Wealth Inequality, and more.\n\nArtwork generated from the quote at [3:05 - 3:11] where he states that crypto feels underrated by most intellectually honest people. \n\n10% of proceeds go to Bankless DAO.",
