    "description": "Recollection | noun\nrec·​ol·​lec·​tion\n\nthe action or power of recalling to mind\n\nThis series, made in the Spring of 2014, is about growing up, becoming an adult, falling in love, or just looking back on hazy distant memories. Almost dream-like.\n\nWhen the places you're in during a dream are far too perfect and orderly, but at the same time, there's something odd about them that you can't quite figure out.\n\nPerfectly imperfect.\n\nEach photograph will come with a 13x19 print I made myself in 2014.",
