    "description": "Finding a balance between urbanism and nature.\n\nThis is a sound embedded video experience of my illuminated ink drawing on mylar.\n\nMy larger formats typically hint at urban architecture or natural landscapes. Some of them are free-hanging and illuminated from behind using LED light strips and other light sources, thereby enhancing the brightness of the colors. Ink layers of varying thicknesses, partially in neon colors, bring about an iridescent quality where images of real architecture are combined with a colorful interpretation of nature through the overlay of special polyester films. This creates a sophisticated, soft-focus effect that is both graphically delicate and gossamer-fine in style, conveying more haziness than tangible reality, more vision than impression. \n\nThe illuminated free-hanging works are my vision of bright city lights and I specifically design the light to fit each artistic creation.",
