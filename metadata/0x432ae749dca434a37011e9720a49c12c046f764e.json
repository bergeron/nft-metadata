    "description": "The world is making a transition from a state of heat to a state of cold, Hot dances will soon be replaced by cold guards. The whole month there is a sun that warms our bodies and souls, storing in us warmth for the whole winter. All creatures prepare supplies for the winter, reap the harvest, with all love for each nearest soul. The spirits gather to thank each other and help in the transition to another dimension. Every soul prepares for hibernation, large spirits gather in places of power to help in the change of energies. Each spirit knows its strength, and from this they feel their place and role. \nDruids, together with strong spirits, prepare to conduct rituals of purification and gratefulness.\nThis work is one of the \"Autumn sage\" series from 2019",
