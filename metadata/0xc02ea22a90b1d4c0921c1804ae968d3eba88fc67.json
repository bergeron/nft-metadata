So I am doing what seems the best thing to do, I signed up for XCAPA. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I can’t fight any longer. You see I can’t even write this well. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life outside to you. I'm sorry, I love you and I'll wait for you inside. \n\nI don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been...\n\nM.",
