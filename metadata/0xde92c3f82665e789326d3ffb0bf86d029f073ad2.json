    "description": "While the beauty of autumn is incomparable, it's more than just the leaves and needles of trees dying. These larch trees' final golden hue reveals the beauty of change itself. They showcase their true colors in a spectacular fashion, even though the circumstance itself is not glorious. It's comparable to how the best in people comes out when faced with difficult situations. \n\nIt also symbolizes that change can be good and cherish certain things while we have them. The fleeting beauty of autumn has drawn me in as a photographer and taught me to appreciate its intrinsic value. \n\nI took this photo this past fall in the Italian Dolomites at sunrise. Cold temperatures created foggy conditions as the sun rose over the mountains. It was a special morning spent with friends during an unforgettable trip through the Alps. \n\nThis photo will be available for HQ download for printing and other personal use. Similar to other NFTs I've sold, 10% of proceeds will be donated to the Sierra Club.",
