    "description": "Finding beauty in simplicity is a constant journey no one can really contain. For instance, to the general population the color green once represented agricultural properties and yet now it’s reduced to monetary tendencies. One’s own personal journey is also simplified due to the consistent pressure social media likes to drown our minds in. In Roman mythology Saturn is the sun of Coelus and Terra and the father of Jupiter. Saturn also answered to the name “Time”. Time, another topic we often take for granted. As we circle back, I want to note that the color green can also be defined as “immature and young”, which is something we could all definitely describe Jean-Michel Basquiat’s death to be. Time is pure, as is your journey. \n",
