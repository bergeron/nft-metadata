    "description": "The morning sun and rainbow bias , give a new spirit on this journey.\n\nThe most memorable journey while in the Himalayas, treading the path from machapuchre basecamp to annapurna basecamp accompanied by a very beautiful atmosphere after the rain stops, the morning sun began to appear and gave rise to a very beautiful rainbow bias.\n\nTrekking in the Himalayas during the rainy season is an extraordinary experience apart from trekking that is not easy but there is a very unique beauty, ranging from mountains shrouded in thin fog and rainbows that decorate the roof of the world after the rain stop .",
