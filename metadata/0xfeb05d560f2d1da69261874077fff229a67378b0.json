    "description": "Reflection\n\nAs you gaze upon the photograph, you are drawn to the reflection it captures. The water, so still and calm, mirrors the world above it perfectly. But as you look closer, you realize that the reflection is more than just a copy of what lies above. It is a reminder that there is always more than meets the eye. Just as the reflection reveals the beauty of the world above, it also shows a different perspective, a new way of seeing things. It is a call to look beyond the surface, to seek out the hidden depths that lie beneath. The reflection beckons us to explore, to discover, and to embrace the complexity and richness of the world around us.\n\nTechnique: Original photograph + AI  \nAI Generator: Midjourney  \nLocation: Mount Sabalan, Iran  \nEdition: 1/1  \nYear: 2020  \nPhotographer: Asef Azi  \nDimensions (in pixels): 2012 x 2452",
