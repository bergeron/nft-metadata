    "description": "There are only a few nights I can think of where I've been so cold, yet felt so alive. During winter of 2019, I spent the month of March living out of the front seat of a rental car in Northern Norway. It was far from luxurious, but the experiences I was able to have will stick with me for a lifetime. \n\nWe were tent camping on the island of Senja the night this photo was captured. Temps dropped to around -10 degrees Fahrenheit as day turned into night, and then came a show unlike anything I'd ever witnessed before. From horizon to horizon, the Aurora danced in a brilliant display of sapphire and violet across the night sky. It was one of the most spectacular natural phenomenon I've seen to date, in one of the most striking landscapes you can imagine. Surrounded on all sides by tall snowcapped mountains and the sea, all while the sky erupted, is something I'll never forget. ",
