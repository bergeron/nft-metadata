    "description": "Bringing Punk6529 threads to life in audio format. \nThis first NFT is an homage to his first mega thread that is pinned in his twitter profile. \nIt's a snippet with the following text below, but our goal is to store full threads in the blockchain so that the knowledge shared does not depend on Twitter anymore: \n\n------------  \nOn A Pathway To An Open Metaverse\n\nWe are going to make a run at changing the arc of history.\n\nIt is a Return of the Jedi vs the Death Star style mission.\n\nThey have the money and the power. We mostly have our brains, our community and gm.\n\nBut it might be just enough.\n\nA step back.\n\n6529 has been involved in crypto since BTC summer 2013.\n\nFrom the first day, I was convinced that BTC and its successors would change the world, make it a better world, decentralize power away from choke points, and that this was a net good for humanity.\n\nI played a small role in BTC's development and acceptance.\n\nSmall in the scheme of things, but important to me, and, at the time, it was a \"risky\" move.\n\nAnd since then I have been waiting for our more decentralized social systems to emerge.\n\nAnd waiting, and waiting... \n\n6529  has 'institutional credentials.'\n\nI am completely comfortable in the 'system' and the system is good to me.\n\nI am not a loser in our current system, I am a winner.\n\nBut my heart is in crypto, I spend a lot of time on crypto IRL, and know a lot about crypto. \n\nI did not seriously look at NFTs until February and within months....\n\n...well, I like the JPGs and by summer I had quite the NFT portfolio.\n\nSo what next?",
