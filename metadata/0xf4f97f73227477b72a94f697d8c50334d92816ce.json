    "name": "Lost In A Dream",
    "description": "According to research, the human fetus dreams from the thirty-second week and in this state reacts to the sounds and energies around it. But since it has no data to analyze its surroundings, we guess it is like being immersed in a dream full of light and energy. Unaware of what world is ahead of him.\n \nThe forthcoming work is the first version of the re-creation of this concept.\n\nI should mention that 30% of the proceeds from the sale of this work is spent on helping pregnant mothers and babies in need.\n\nThe dimensions of the work are 1920 x 1080 pixels, and if the buyer wants, the full composite version with 4k resolution will be sent to him along with the full 3D project.\n\nThe music used in this work is composed by Peyman Yazdanian and the name of the track is the music of the Friday soldiers, which is used in this work from 2:20 to 2:41.\n\nMany thanks to Reza Aali for his help in designing the original 3d of human fetus and thanks to Peyman Yazdanian for the music track used in this ",
