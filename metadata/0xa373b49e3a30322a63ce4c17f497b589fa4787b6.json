    "description": "Maybe it happened to you that you see someone's pic and you wish you were in her place. Because of beauty, money, body, or anything else. But you don't know the whole story. Maybe that person is in a bad situation that she is willing to give all her possessions to have something that you have. Something like peace! \nThe girl in this painting has the same story as I told. She is intellectually in the most disturbed state that is possible. But who knows? They just see her beauty, not her mind...\n\nHand-drawn artwork with ink, poster color, and cont√© on cardboard.\nSize: 210 x 297 mm",
