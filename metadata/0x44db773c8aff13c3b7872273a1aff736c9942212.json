    "description": "Collectible 0 of Skoollest Horde, an exclusive NFT collection inspired by the skull, an element so revered since the dawn of humanity. Artists such as Goya, Van Gogh, Dal√≠, Basquiat, Rembrandt and Frida Kahlo have dabbled in the universe of skulls and have captured their particular artistic visions.\n\nIn Skoollest Horde, we have fused styles and beliefs from several cultures, honoring human expressions as famous as the Mexican skulls, but going a little further... with designs much more creepy! Also, we pay tribute to the Day of the Dead and Halloween, with its terrifying atmosphere; to novels, literary Calaveras and horror movies, with some Tim Burton influence and with a touch of madness and surrealism.\n\nA collection of 25 peerless NFTs with great artistic value, and an interesting investment opportunity in contemporary digital art.\n\nDeveloped by [Optryx Labs](https://optryx.io)",
