    "name": "Raijin's Penance",
    "description": "Raijin is depicted as a powerful, muscular figure with wild, electrified hair and a fierce expression on his face. Despite his formidable appearance, however, he is shown in a state of penance, seated on the ground with his head bowed in shame and remorse. Behind his head stars form and dissolve a reminder of the destructive power he wields as the god of thunder.  Every day, he repents for the sin of killing his brother, Fujin, and seeks redemption for his actions he holds his brothers last belongings on his lap and also a chanting beads on his hand chanting his brothers name for eternity .Despite the weight of his guilt, Raijin remains determined to atone for his mistakes, knowing that it is the only way he can hope to find peace and reconciliation. In these recent times monks have made a  monestry nearby to seek help and guidance from a god.\n\nSoftware:Procreate\nDimensions: 4492px X 3160px\nTotal strokes made:159526\n\nThis artwork is a collaboration of @cryptogodnaman.eth & iambhattasso",
