Modifying the algorithm will give it an infinity of new contexts.\n\nIt’s possible that the most interesting variations in these images are the gravitational anomalies.\n\nThe geometric expression of the infinite variation defies the definition of a singular object; it’s a chain of interlocking structures; interwoven.\n\nOriginal fractal formula and sound design.\n\nRevisiting a three-dimensional fractal formula from the year 2019.\n\nThe Fractalogist.\n\n",
