    "description": "I took a walk at dusk, exploring a dirt road I had not been down before.  The fog was creeping in and as I reached the end of the path I was greeted with this view infinite view of an ocean without end.\n\nI sat there and enjoyed the cool crisp breeze. All was silent but the sound of the waves and an eagle that passed by me too fast to capture.\nThis is one of my top favorite moments that stays with me and brings me to a calm place.  I hope it invokes something in you.",
