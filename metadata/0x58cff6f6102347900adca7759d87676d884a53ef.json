    "description": "\"The Stand\" by Jason Ebeyer, 2022\n\nI am pleased to present my first ever colour 3D digital sculpture. The form exhibited is that of the original character who has been the star in most of my work forever. This character has evolved with me as my art style has grown in and out of different mediums from back when I first started exploring art as a child. \"The Stand\" to me is a representation of taking steps forward into the void of the unfamiliar and new.",
