    "description": "The year was 2015 - We were on tour doing a show in Laughlin, Nevada and on the bill with us was a guy who's show i grew up watching on MTV... pop culture icon & comedian, Andy Milonakis. \n\nI used to hear him freestyle on 'The Andy Milonakis Show' and always thought he had mad skills with funny wordplay. Well the night of the show i watched his set and realized he was a serious emcee with a passion for hip-hop music, crazy stage presence and ill comedic gift between bars. \n\nWe ended up connecting on new song called 'RAD!' dropping exclusively for soundxyz. Add this to your collection & premint the drop.",
