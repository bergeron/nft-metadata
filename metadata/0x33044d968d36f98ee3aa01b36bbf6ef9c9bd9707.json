    "description": "AI DPP - Artificial Intelligence, Disruptive Pattern Pixels\n\nAI DPP is an exploration into the generation of camouflage using Artificial Intelligence (AI). The works were created through machine [learning] and human collaboration, referencing the use of camouflage in the military, pop culture iterations and natural occurrences in the animal kingdom where camouflage originates. \n\nTo generate an output Artificial Intelligence learns from the patterns in the data set, much like traditional camouflage in the natural world and for military purposes, which recognises it’s the patterns in terrains and it’s surroundings that need to be utilised in order to conceal. \n\nAI DPP was established before the artist entered NFTs, the decision to mint these works cites the lure and popularity of anonymity, and ultimately blending in, in the Web3 space. \n\n Each NFT is a 1/1 with 20 works in the initial series",
