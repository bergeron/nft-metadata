    "description": "The first NFT from the Vision of Life collection. The video was shot on thermal imagery during an air alarm on the streets of Ivano-Frankivsk, Western Ukraine. Place of conditional security in the country in state of war. \n\nThe Touchdesigner patch simulates the effect of blurring and pixelation of military photo and video materials. These effects are used for security, hiding faces and architecture in the background. The view from the thermal imager is usually aimed at a potential victim or at the enemy.\n\n“Vision of Life” is a charitable NFT project for the Port Frankivsk voluntary organization.\n\nDirected by Diana Derii\nSound design: Maks Yos ( ypenko )\nTouchdesigner patch: Diana Derii\nOperator: Diana Derii\n\n",
