    "description": "A collaborative project between 2 artists is like the conception of a child.\n\nEach individual brings their own self on the table.\nTheir own creativity, vision, style.\n\nThey bring their own history, and their hard work.\n\n\n\n**Colinsdoodles** is known for his 100% handmade painted portraits, his great personality, his drawing talent and his unique style.\n\n\n**Cake One** is known for her clean crisps 3D renders, mostly portraits too and her special attention to lighting.\n\n\n\nThey both decided to team up, moved by their mutual respect and true friendship to create something new and beyond both of them.\n\nLike a child, a collaborative project can't be claimed by only one of the creators.\nIT's genuinely a perfect mix of two artists where the result is more than just the sum of two individuals.\n\n**Like a daughter who has her father's smile but her mother's sense of humor, this one:**\n\n*She's got your eyes.*",
