    "description": "We are people of the 4th millennium.\nHumanity is no longer the same as before.\nWe are the ones who stayed here- half humans, half code (program).\nOur skin glows like a silicon wafer.\nWe almost destroyed nature on Earth, but there are still growing flowers somewhere.\nAnd these flowers became a modern cult, an obsession, animal passion.\n\nPeople are the Gods who created the new world,\nbut the Gods above people are nature.\nFlowers are the only thing that the Earth still gives to humanity.\nHumans go crazy when they see flowers, smell them, taste them, dance with them, touch them, admire them...\n_\n\n35 mm film \nZenit- E: Kodak Vision200",
