    "description": "The UC Clock displays 1440 different hues, one for each minute of the day. Each mint is tethered to a specific randomly assigned minute of the day. All 1440 NFTs display the color clock in its entirety and the specific minute that each NFT is tethered to will appear brighter and more saturated during that minute than the rest of the clock. This enables you to own a unique color, exclusive to your NFT, that correlates to a distinct minute in the 24-hour clock.",
