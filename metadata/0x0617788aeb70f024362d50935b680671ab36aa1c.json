    "description": "I made a cage out of myself and sat on its corner of loneliness , thinking about the outside world, the passion, the life, about the real existence.\nBut I'm not even enough for myself, how can I be ready for you, how can I find a way to you ?\n\nI have to find a way , I have to get out of this small room so that I may find a sign from you , a sign from your laughters from your dances.\nI must be real again, perhaps I'll be free this time , maybe you’ll find my shadow again…\n\nby 'Fx'",
