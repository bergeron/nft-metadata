Things are man's companions, and they, too, are in space.\n\nCertain things are peculiar to each stage of human life, but stages replace each other, and things remain, filling up space.\n\nAnd at some point in our lives, we realize that in order to move on, we need more space or fewer things.\n\nBut it can be hard to say goodbye to things that have been your companions for a certain period of life, just as it can be hard to say goodbye to people close to you.\n\nA person is looking for a way out.",
