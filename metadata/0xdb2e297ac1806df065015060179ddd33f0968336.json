    "description": "1/1 piece\nWhat you are looking at is a photography.\n\nMy aim is to take photographs that can be interpreted as abstract art whereas they are  figurative art works that represent objects or events in the real world. By creating an illusion of abstract art, I am trying to tell the audience that we don't always need 3D softwares, or paint to create art. What you're looking at is indeed real world objects photographed in an artistic way.\n\nThis is one of the genesis pieces of the collection called 'Supermatist Photography' showing superior quality of figures (real life objects) rather than supremity of shapes.\n\nNo computer rendering or painting is involved. That's why it is possible to see imperfections. ",
