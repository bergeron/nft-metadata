    "description": "The Aibits collection is unique in that it is created using artificial intelligence algorithms that generate artwork based on a set of rules and parameters established by the artist. This results in an endless array of possibilities and a constantly evolving collection that never becomes repetitive or predictable. Each Aibit is created using a combination of algorithms that work together to produce stunning visuals. The algorithms used include fractal generation, cellular automata, and reaction-diffusion, among others. These algorithms generate complex patterns and shapes that are impossible to replicate manually.",
