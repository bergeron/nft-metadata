    "description": "On March 21, 2021 during the equinox at the exact moment when day and night were of equal parts, Chester Cheetah saw his own shadow cast upon the Pink Panther whereupon the Pantherâ€™s skin turned orange and bore the black spots of Cheetah. In this moment, Cheetah became conscious and aware of all things, thus beginning his journey towards total enlightenment! Traveling all time and space, he communes with Lao Tzu, author of the Tao Te Ching, and he tells Cheetah he must experience the 10,000 things to gain greater awareness.",
