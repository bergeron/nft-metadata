    "description": "This is a mix up of the recordings of the digital copies I made from the painting \"Whisperings of Love\" from French painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905). Here, like in the previous work MULTIROSTRO1, the image is placed as just a element more, influenced by the onyric, psychedelic style of the first GANs, a suitable effect for the esoteric complexity of AI. As a whole, this and other pieces in the same format are an exploration in the qualities of the image in the contemporary world, as animated statements, from gifs used in our daily mobile conversations to the big screens repeating an endless advertising in the luminous billboards of the street, an image of kinetic nature, movement and light, colour and light. An exploration of movement, of the digital creation where the looping video is also a mental space, a kind of image, -perpetual, cyclical - more present than ever, thanks to the formats such as GIFs among others",
