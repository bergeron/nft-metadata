    "description": "G Loop \n\nOur universe looks pretty chaotic, I give you that. For me, cosmology has always been filled with topics that make me fascinated. With my major being physics, I learned that gravity, as one of the four fundamental forces of nature, is the most absorbing one, despite being the most undiscovered force in the world.\nIn this visualization, I intend to emulate a simple system based on Newton’s law of universal gravity. I considered the first 3000 numbers of Recamán's sequence in Cartesian coordinates as gravitational points and released 210 free particles in seven separate groups with initial locations and different colors in space to move in the gravitational field resulting from my gravity particles. The outcome, which you can see, is the recording of the particle paths.\n\n4000x400 px - PNG\nMade entirely with code written in P5.js, July 2022",
