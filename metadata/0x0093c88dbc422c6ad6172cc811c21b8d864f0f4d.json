    "description": "I wanted to mint this piece as a tribute to my  early supporters. I love creating art, but I really love creating abstract art. This is the FIRST piece I’ve ever minted, and while creating it I tried to capture my mood. As you can see, there’s lots of warm colors and something that has always brought happiness and joy to my heart was the textures of a stain glass window; specifically the different mixtures of colors and how they flow so perfectly in glass has always been so fascinating to me. I tried draw inspiration and make my own colorful warm stainglass window and capture my happiness within that window that I made for you here. Every time you look into this piece I want you it to bring you pure happiness and joy. \n\n\nThe fact that I could figure out how to mint this project is a huge deal to me. Thank you for supporting.\n\nI look forward to OUR journey together",
