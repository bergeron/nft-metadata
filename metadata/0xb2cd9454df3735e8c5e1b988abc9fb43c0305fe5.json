    "description": "All alone on a dark and stormy night. The rumble of thunder fading in and out followed distant flashes. Gradually, they started getting brighter and the rumble soon turned to earth trembling booms. I stood in this same spot for what seemed like an eternity, but time was running out. Soon the rain will overtake me, and lightning will reach for the ground at a range too close for normal comfort and safety. My lights were set up and ready, the camera in place looking down the center of the road. With a single, powerful, cloud to ground strike it was over.\n\nArtist: Tim Baca\nISO: 100\nFstop: 8\nShutter Speed: 13.0 seconds\nCamera: Conon EOS R\nLens: EF16-35mm @35mm\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in\nadvertising, display privately and in\ngroups, including virtual galleries,\ndocumentaries and essays by holder of\nthe NFT, as long as creator is credited.\nProvides no rights to create commercial\nmerchandise, commercial distribution, or\nderivative works.
