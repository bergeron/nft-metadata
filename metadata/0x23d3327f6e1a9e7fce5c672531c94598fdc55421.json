    "description": "The idea of this painting formed in my mind (as usual) when I was deeply meditating, seeing something softly creeping on me. It left its seeds while I was sleeping. A green tree emerged from my dream and covered me up in the peace of water. The vision that was planted in my mind still remains. It fills me like a restless dream, Within the sound of silence.\n\nresolution = 1500*2000\nbit rate = 10411K\nframe rate = 25 FPS\nformat = mp4\nSoftware = PS, AE\n\nOriginal painting in Watercolor 24\"x18\"\nMotion designer: mlico\nInstagram: @work.sajad.moradi\ntwitter: @mlicooo",
