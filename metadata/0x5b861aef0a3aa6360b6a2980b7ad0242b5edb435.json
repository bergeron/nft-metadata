    "description": "I made this art during a day when I felt down and just started painting with no direction. I just wanted to make something hoping that It will distract me from all the negative surounding that day. After making this I felt better looking at the textures and colors I felt a good vibe energy every time i saw it and till this day it give me good energy looking at my artwork.",
