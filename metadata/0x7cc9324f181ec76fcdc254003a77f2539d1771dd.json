    "description": "According to quantum properties physical bodies in the absence of time can be in different coordinates at the same time. Spacionism uses these remarkable compositional properties to create these works of art based on quantum principles. Spacionism is defined as the visual representation of the properties of waves. Which are two dimensional in the use of space such as; light, heat and the center of gravity of the earth to mention basic examples. Thanks to this principle we can play on what it would be like to exist in the second dimension.",
