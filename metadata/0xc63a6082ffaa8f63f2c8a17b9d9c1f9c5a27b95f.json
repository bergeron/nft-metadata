    "description": "We often seek meaning in the context of things. What meanings we may assign to things when there is no context available.\n\nThis art is part of a photographic and design experiment series to investigate the importance of context in a work of art and beyond. Free of embellishment, elaborate identities, and narratives, my work is solely relying on designâ€™s inherit powerful language to engage the viewer in a dialogue. All the elements in this body of work are arranged thoughtfully in blank spaces with as much less information as possible in all the situations allowing the viewer to engage, prob, and make meaning of his own out of them.\n\nThrough this work, I am suggesting that context at times just serves as a backdrop hence should not be the only factor for understanding the sensitivity and gravity of an event or situation.\n\nTitle: No Context 01\nSize: 1200 x 1200 Pixels ",
