    "description": "Did you know that a year in ancient Egypt started on the first decan of the Leo sign, which was personified by the image of the Lion-Serpent called Chnoubis?\nIt is believed that this figure served as an inspiration for the Gnostic Demiurge Yaldabaoth image. That’s Solar Phallic deity and that’s the reason why I chose these shapes for this image, playing with the geometry and silhouette of the ancient gems. ",
