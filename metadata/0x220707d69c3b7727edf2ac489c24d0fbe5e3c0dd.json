    "description": "InSporeAtion\nAcrylic on Canvas\n24x36 inches\n2019-2020\n\nI began this painting in Amsterdam during the Truffles Therapy workshop that I helped organize in 2019, which facilitated legal psilocybin therapy in a safe and wholesome environment. My life was changed by the magic mushroom and I believe in the effectiveness of its healing potential if used with reverence as a sacrament.\n\nI have been continually humbled and amazed by the power of these little teachers, which have so much healing potential and wisdom within them if we can orient ourselves to silence our minds and fully pay attention. It is my hope that someday this medicine can be acceptable and legal among all nations, and I think it is one of the great heresies against nature that we have made these harmless and beneficent allies illegal. \n",
