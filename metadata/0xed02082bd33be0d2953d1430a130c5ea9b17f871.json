They scavenge for resources, battle hostile entities, and expand their territories with a fierce determination that knows no bounds. For in this brutal world, only the strongest and most resilient will survive. And the Bubble Bots will stop at nothing to ensure their own survival, even if it means taking on the darkest and most dangerous of challenges.",
