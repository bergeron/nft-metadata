    "name": "Dry Season Courts",
    "description": "Every year in November the dry season drains the Mekong River river—a natural border that separates Thailand and Laos. As it recedes, sand flats are quickly repurposed by people living close by until the land is reclaimed when the water returns. \n\nThe flat, sandy, packed surface serves as an ideal pitch for one of the most widely played sports in southeast Asia—Sepak Takraw. Takraw combines the area-of-play principles of volleyball/badminton with the contact principles of soccer as players volley a small, bamboo-woven, hollow ball with their feet, head, knees, and shoulders over a net towards the opposing team. \n\nThe day before this image was made, local youth gathered in the early evening with shovels, posts, nets and chalk powder to construct and mark their courts that would stand for the duration of the dry season. \n\nWaiting until sunset the next day—when the afternoon heat had subsided—they returned to fit in as many matches as possible in the quickly fading twilight.",
