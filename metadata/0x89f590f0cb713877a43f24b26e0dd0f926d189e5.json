    "description": "This is 1 NFT from the unique collection \"Predators and Favorites\".\nThis miracle was created on a cozy, warm summer evening in the park with crayons. And later it was refined a little bit with graphics. But in my opinion, it turned out great!\n\nArt 4000 x 4000 px\n\nNFT is unique.\nThe lion is the king of beasts. Let him be the king of your collection! ü¶Å\n",
