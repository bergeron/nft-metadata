    "description": "Be water and be gentle to yourself. We are sharing this mindful moment with you, which we enjoyed so much on our vocation in Guangzhou, China. \n\nI’ve never had a chance to observe the contour of the sun, but now, the waves harmonize it’s aggressiveness, soften it’s light. While the clouds are floating away and the shuttering leaves are creating their own song, the sun stays still, warm and bright. \nMay you also find the warmth, peace and joy in this piece. \nEnjoy.
