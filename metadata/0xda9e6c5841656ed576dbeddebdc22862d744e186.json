    "description": "Humanos (NFTs series)  were made from handmade drawing/stop-motion animation. The animation was created during the time I lived in Boston. I like to think of B-town as a place where I found myself. Getting lost in the city, biking in the snow, experiencing the seasons like never before, undergoing various harsh circumstances at the same time I forged some of the most beautiful friendships with people I felt deeply inspired by. \nHumanos is a reminiscence of my Boston experiences, but also in a way the recounting of what it is to be a human in the world, a human that dreamt to be an artist.  This collection would not have been complete without the collaboration of Nate Tucker an amazing percussionist and composer based in Boston. Each Humano has a unique music track.  50% of the earnings from this collection will go to Nate Tucker. The track used in these NFTs series are an excerpt from some pieces Tucker will release on an upcoming album. https://www.noheliavargasb.com/humanos",
