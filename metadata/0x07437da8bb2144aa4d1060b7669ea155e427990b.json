    "description": "When fall comes, the cold breezes begin to make their way through the landscape, reminding the residents of how fragile warmth is, and how easily it can be taken away from them.\n\nOnly in these winds can we find Kakao, which, when ground and drunk, keeps one warm throughout even the coldest of nights. The winds carrying the near weightless seeds are now rarer, thus beginning the skirmishes to hoard the precious Kompono for one's own.",
