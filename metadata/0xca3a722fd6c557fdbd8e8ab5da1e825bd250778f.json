    "description": "Getting that perfect shot is a matter of having patience and not giving up. For me as a landscape photographer, a morning with a blanket of fog are the perfect conditions. They are however not very common and even if there is fog, there is no guarantee it is at the location you want.  \nI already knew this location, Castle the Haar, and I have wanted to photograph this place with morning fog for some time. It took me a year to get the photo I wanted! Many early wake up calls and driving to the castle, but disappointed when there was no fog. I started planning and always have a plan B location so that I would not get up for nothing! Finally on this beautiful spring morning everything turned out perfect. Even though just before sunrise, the fog was on the wrong side of the road! But after sunrise, it turned a little bit magical and this was the result.",
