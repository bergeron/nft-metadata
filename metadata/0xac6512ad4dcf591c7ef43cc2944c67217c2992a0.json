    "description": "The Second creature in the 'color pop' creature series. Done in one of my trademark styles where I use very minimal color to create a visual 'pop' that draws the viewer's eye in to the painting and on to the creature.\n\nEach year there is only one finished painting of a creature NFT done in this style. These pieces are ULTRA rare.",
