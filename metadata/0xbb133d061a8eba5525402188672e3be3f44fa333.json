    "description": "\"Fragile\" captures the essence of human vulnerability through its portrayal of shattered glass figures lying on the ground. This project serves as a poignant reminder of how easily we can break and how important it is to handle ourselves and others with care. Through its striking imagery, \"Fragile\" urges viewers to reflect on the importance of empathy and compassion towards our fellow human beings.\n\nEdition 1/1 by Antti Karppinen",
