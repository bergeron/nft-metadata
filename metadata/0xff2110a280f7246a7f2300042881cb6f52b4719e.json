    "description": "Friday night Northern Lights photographed in the center of Reykjavik above Hallgr√≠mskirkja.\nIt was one of the best moments of my life when I walked in and immediately saw the lights in the shape of dragon directly above the famous church. I laid down on the ground and quickly shot vertical panorama to capture the whole scene. Shortly after, it was all over.",
