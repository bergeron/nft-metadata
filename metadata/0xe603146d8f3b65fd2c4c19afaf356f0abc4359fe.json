After reading a book named \"I\", I became more interested in being in a challenge related to my artwork. \nThe question will remain with the audience from the beginning to the end.  Who am \"I\"? And do you see me? Why do I deny my existence? Where can I be?\n\nHope for Iran is a collection of artworks from Iranian artists. \nIt is a testimony to the strength of the Iranian people and the diversity of their art.",
