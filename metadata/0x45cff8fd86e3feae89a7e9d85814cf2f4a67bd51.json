    "description": "'The Drunken Concubine’ is inspired by the famous Chinese Opera which tells a story of a disappointed concubine who, when stood up at a banquet by the Emperor, decides she will dine alone.  \n\n‘Xiqu’ continues my exploration of traditional Chinese painting and culture through the deconstruction and reinterpretation of ancient Chinese texts on painting with the novel technology of AI. \n\nThis time my subject is traditional Chinese Opera. With its elaborately exquisite costumes, masks, cross-dressing, dramatic expressiveness and rich allegory this vivid collection is a visual feast in homage to tradition through technological experimentation.",
