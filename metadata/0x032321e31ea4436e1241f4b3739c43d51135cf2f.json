    "name": "Fractal Statue",
    "description": "The fractal statue was inspired by Bernini sculptures, when we started doing 3d animation we experimented with abstract fractal imagery. We were able to reimagine these old sculptures, reference history, & pay homage to these incredible creators and modernize them by incorporating digital elements.",
