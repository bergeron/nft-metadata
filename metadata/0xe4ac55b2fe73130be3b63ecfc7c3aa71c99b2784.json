    "description": "Golden light\n\nThis minimal but intense scene crossed my way on an evening walk. It represents the small, raw moments, that we tend to oversee in our busy everyday life. But they are always there. Even in the dark times there is beauty and peace.\n\nThere was no post-editing, except of slight crop - as I love keeping my photography process minimal, too.\n\nLocation: Dresden, Germany\nDate: March, 2022\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
