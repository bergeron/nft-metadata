    "description": " Rebirth is a “simulation of Evolution”\n\n A new life begins with the big bang inside the digital scene. Cell structures; it evolves into tissues, organisms, vertebrates, reptiles, dinosaurs, plants, insects; underwater and surface life, fauna and flora are formed. The happenings that take place in this universe remain within the limits of knowledge that exist in real life. Evolved substances are born as a parameter of real life, with the ignition of lights. In this scene, I go on an expedition by taking pictures of those moments.\n\n Rebirth is the beginning story of a new life in which both myself as an explorer and completely different lost information find themselves. At the base of our mind, which suddenly begins to see beauties we are unaware of, it believes the black hole in the formation process of the universe. And in times of nothingness, questions how ambiguous the reality is.\n",
