    "description": "Nerd Bird\n\n“There were no birds in the sky. Birds are busy finding their own way in a world where they cannot fly.”\nThrough the story of birds, which are capable of flying freely in the sky yet are often confused as to where to go, we have made it possible for us to sympathize with the confusing emotions we may experience in life.\nBut this work also conveys hope. Even if a person has lost their way, I tried to show them the courage to stand up again and find a new path through the images of birds that do not want to lose their color.\n\n\n[DONGZADONGHWI]\n\nStrike a pose! On the surface, the frenetic characters and colors who inhabit Korean artist DONGZADONGHWI’s work are dramatic enough to turn heads in busy traffic. But one double-take reveals a whole ecosystem of emotions roiling beneath the surface. As a millennial on the cusp of South Korea’s tidal wave of global influence, DONGZADONGHWI’s childhood was tumultuous, but it was still a childhood rooted in the 90s nevertheless. Thus, a fascination with rock and roll idols developed, the more rebellious the better. From Japan’s Hide to England’s David Bowie and back again to native Korean rock star  SeoTaiji, these solitary figures loomed larger, louder, and more colorful than life itself to the young artist- and their styles, attitudes, and even poses still strut beneath the strokes of his artwork today. Yet, they are also in conversation with the patterns and images found in traditional Korean folklore, the kind of stories filled with hope that are so often told to boys and girls who cannot go to sleep at night. Given this context, the frequent motif of a bird is a fitting choice for an artist who approaches each work like a chapter in a bildungsroman, mixing equal parts childlike wonder with reckless teenage abandon to produce something that yearns to break free and take flight upon a global stage. As a video artist since 2015, DONGZADONGHWI enjoys collaborating with musicians and his progression to the realm of web3 was a natural one- his thirst for color only rivaled by his search for life’s meaning beyond mediums, from painting to sculpture and now NFTs.\n\n\nhttps://dongzadonghwi.art/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dongzadonghwi/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dongzadonghwi",
