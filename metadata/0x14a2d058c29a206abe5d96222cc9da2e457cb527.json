The little guardian is named after the great pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus, because everything is movement, change and eternally living fire.\n\nEach image is a reminder not to fall into deep sleep, in the form of a symbol of the four states described by Buddha in the transit of life in search of awakening.\n\nCotama\n\nTitle: The Truth of Suffering\n\nCollection: The four noble truths, Heraclitus Chihuahua\n\nDigital art\nArt 1 of 1\n5000 x 5000 px\n300 PPi\nPNG\n46.8 MB",
