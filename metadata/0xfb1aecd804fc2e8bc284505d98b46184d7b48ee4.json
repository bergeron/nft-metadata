    "description": "The Patch Tool is one of Photoshop’s most frequently used functions – it duplicates and uses pixels of your selection to replace target pixels, therefore achieving the goal of retouching and repairing your images. Taking the feature as the main creative approach, I patched photos that I shot about the city of Shanghai. After the target pixels got overlaid once and again, the original images started to get blurry and gradually became abstract – only by carefully observing the details can you identify some fragmented information.As a native Shanghainese, I’ve witnessed the city’s gentrification at an incredible pace, which has made many places completely different from what they used to look like. With the remark, it occurs to me that while the original images have been demolished by the excessive use of the Patch Tool, the effects seem to have created results of greater sensual stimulation. However, do they really represent the better outcomes?",
