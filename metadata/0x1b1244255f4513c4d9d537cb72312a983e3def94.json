    "description": "The ultimate desert survival animal is the Camel, they can survive up to 15 days without water. One of the reasons that they can survive that long is because of their humps.\n \nThey store fat in their humps (not water) and can use this to help them go longer without water.\n\nThis single NFT edition artistic photograph was taken from Tabuk northern Saudi Arabia during sunset framing it with the mountains.",
