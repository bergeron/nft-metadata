    "description": "\"this is not a pepe\" is an unoriginal spin on surrealist Ren√© Magritte's renowned \"The Treachery of Images.\" It delves into the age-old dilemma of art representation where what we see is merely an interpretation of an object, and not the object itself.\n\nThe same can be said for NFTs. Digital assets challenge the traditional notion of ownership and value, just like \"this is not a pepe\" challenges our perception of 'art.' NFTs are not the JPEGs themselves, but rather a representation of it - a testament to the eternal treachery of images.\n\n-ChatGPT\n\n2400x1680 px @ 300PPI",
