    "description": "It is like dominoes in Luna's head. Everything is falling apart. Heart over mind, mind over necessity, necessity over inner peace. Riddled with countless doubts and questions while she seeks for assurance and some sign from the universe; \"when will I feel okay, just for a minute\". Will everything remain stagnant as she watches the unkind world move by or will she witlessly keep checking her ridiculous horoscope for a sign of hope. Everything keeps changing, everybody leaves.\n\nDimensions: 4500 x 3000\n\nSize: 8.70 MB\n\nPNG File, 300 pixels",
