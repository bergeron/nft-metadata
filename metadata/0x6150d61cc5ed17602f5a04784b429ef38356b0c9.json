The insignificance of the totality of your actions. We exist to prove that our memory will live on in those who love us. We claw at locked doors expecting to find a mausoleum hidden on the other side, validating our desolate existence. The truth is much more melancholy and banal. We must find beauty in the decay. That is how we will live through the passing of days and years until we expire.",
