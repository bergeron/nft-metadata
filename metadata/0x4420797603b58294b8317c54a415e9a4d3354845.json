    "description": "\nIn the depths of NFT tax hell? Did your accountant also quit once they learned you traded NFTs? Struggling to parse thousands of etherscan transactions? We got tired of endlessly screaming “Fuck the IRS” into the empty abyss, so we turned it into an NFT to last forever. \n\nWhen you inevitably get audited, here's an NFT to have in your wallet to remind the IRS to go fuck themselves.\n\nNo roadmap. No community. No Discord. Just the collective agreement that the IRS should go fuck themselves.\n\nOn 4/18 one lucky person will win 50% of the ETH from the mint to get that much needed tax relief. 35% of the funds will be donated to crypto advocate groups to help with lobbying efforts. The remaining 15% will go to the team cause we got taxes too. \n\nWARNING: Minting this NFT should be compared to literally lighting money on fire. But hey we’ve all aped into worse NFTs right? For those that don’t win, congrats on the tax write off. Your NFT is worthless.\n  "
