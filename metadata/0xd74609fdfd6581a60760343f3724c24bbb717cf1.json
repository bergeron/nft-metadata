    "description": "With this my photo, I won the 1st place in the Turkcell International Photography Contest on \"Art Knows No Barriers\" in 2017.\n\nEvery child's dream is to play. But unfortunately, some children may have difficulties in realizing this dream. It's not impossible, of course. This little girl, who made four children's models by arranging the lids of small pet water bottles, shows us that if people want and persevere, no difficulties can prevent them from reaching their goal.\n\nArtist: Serkan Ülker\nEdition:1/1\nCamera: Nikon D810\nDimensions:6000×4000\nResolution: 300 Dpi\nDate: 31.03.2017",
