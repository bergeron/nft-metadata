    "description": "A woman works with colorful fabrics hanging down from her stilt house in order to be dried in the sunlight. Handcrafted fabrics are very traditional and popular in Inle Lake, Shan State in Myanmar. The tradition of making handcrafted fabric has today faded into obscurity, and Inle Lake is one of the places in Myanmar where you can still observe this ancient technique. These handcrafted fabrics are made using natural dyes and dried under sunlight. This process controls fabric shrinkage before sending the fabrics out as finished products in the market. This photo represents the art of traditional fabric work in Inle Lake, Myanmar.\n\nEdition:1/1\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
