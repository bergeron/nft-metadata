    "description": "Color snapshots of Echo, who was a homeless youth and one of the two main subjects in Raised By Wolves, and her first child. The black and white background is constructed from cut-up contact sheets depicting life on the streets.\n\nFor ten years Jim Goldberg worked closely with, and documented, runaway teenagers in the streets of San Francisco and Los Angeles as they fumbled through lives colored by addiction, abuse, and violence. The book focused particularly on the stories of Tweeky Dave and Echo, two charismatic and deeply troubled young runaways whose lives became intertwined. Raised By Wolves expands upon a style of documentary photography combining original photographs, text, and a variety of other illustrative elements including home movie stills, snapshots, drawings, diary entries, and images of discarded belongings. The exhibition includes these materials as well as single and multi-channel video, sculpture, found objects, and light boxes.\n\nEdition: 1 of 1",
