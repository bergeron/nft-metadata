    "description": "A solar equinox is a moment in time when the Sun crosses the Earth's equator, which is to say, appears directly above the equator, rather than north or south of the equator. On the day of the equinox, the Sun appears to rise \"due east\" and set \"due west\". This occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September.[a]",
