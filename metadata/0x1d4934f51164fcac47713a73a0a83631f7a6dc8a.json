    "description": "Pulled off on the side of a desolate road in the middle of nowhere, South Dakota, I fight my car door open against the howling winds. Camera in hand, I run down the hill toward a tattered wire fence and look out toward the rapidly approaching storm.\n\nAn abandoned, decaying farmhouse sits alone upon the vast expanse of rolling green hills, seemingly out of place from its surroundings. A herd of cows nestles around it to shelter from the storm's powerful winds and blowing dust, and I could hear their muffled calls in the distance.\n\nI raise my camera and fire off several bursts of its shutter when a magnificent bolt of lightning strikes the earth right in front of me, maybe a few hundred yards away. I quickly glance at my LCD screen to see if I captured it, and my jaw drops as the final composition is revealed: a perfectly crisp and massive lightning bolt dwarfs the little farmhouse and its herd of sheltering cows.\n\nChills run up my spine. Within the textures of the tumultuous clouds above, one can envision the furious face of Zeus staring outward as he hurtles his massive electric daggers toward the earth.\n\n\nArtist: Jessica Moore  \nTitle: \"Zeus' Fury\"  \nEdition of 50",
