    "description": "From high in the sky I have always been drawn to the complex landscapes below. I was inspired to start this collection in 2020 as I was traveling around the country during the pandemic for in person doctor appointments due to some health complications. \n\nThese images are part of a growing collection of aerial shots and how they offered a reprieve to the intricacies of traveling at this time. The landscape below was so complex it often had me questioning my impact on this world and how every bit of this earth makes up its beauty in its entirety. \n\nThese first 5 photos in this collection are a representation of the reprieve and peace these scenes gave me as I traveled the country and navigated this health journey.
