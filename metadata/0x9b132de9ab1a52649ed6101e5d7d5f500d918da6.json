    "description": "Over 8 years ago, when russia's invade in Ukraine began, I decided to create a poster in a pin-up style to support soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine fighting in the Eastern Ukraine. Unexpectedly, that poster had huge success on the internet with a lot of people asking if it was possible to buy it and whether I would continue making them for other voluntary battalions as well as for official subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I decided to continue, just for fun at first. After some time Iâ€™ve accumulated certain amount of posters custom-made for specific subunits. That is when it turned into an idea to create special series to represent different voluntary battalions and official subunits of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nIt's time to turn these posters into NFT. \nThe first poster is dedicated to the Donbas Volunteer Battalion.\nFile size: 5906px x 4169px\n",
