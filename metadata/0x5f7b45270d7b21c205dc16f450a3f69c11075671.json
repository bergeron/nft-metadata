    "description": "This is an experiment of photos that my Grandfather created during WWII which have survived all this time.  My grandfather was very passionate about photography and even as he came back from war took on painting in his spare time as a passion project.   I really love this work and I truly believe this should be shared with the world as time ages and slowly deteriorates I would love this work to live on in the digital world.\n\nPlease I would love to share these pictures and I hope you all enjoy and I plan to send a portion of all sales from this work to a veterans charity.  As soon as I do some research and find a veterans charity that will accept crypto that will be my main goal and will be sending 15% of all proceeds to charity and will be actively held in a secondary wallet until I find the right charity.",
