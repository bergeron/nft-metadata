    "description": "Buck Moon 1/1 NFT by Jeff Charron\n\nThe full moon in July is known as the buck moon because it coincides with male deer shedding their antlers so they can grow new, more impressive, sets. I see it as a message to let go of the past so that a better future may begin. I took this photograph shortly after moving from the city I had lived in for 15 years, to a house out in the country. A stressful experience to say the least. Witnessing this scene gave me a sense of peace and an understanding that everything is going to be okay.\n\nGetting this shot took dedication and planning. I saw this view earlier that month, just a few miles from my new home, and knew that it was special. After studying maps and moonrise angles, I realized that it would align perfectly. The night before the moon was full, I set out to the exact location to practice and dial in my settings. This let me focus on timing during the night of, allowing me to capture the moon just as it rose above the tallest peak in Vermont.",
