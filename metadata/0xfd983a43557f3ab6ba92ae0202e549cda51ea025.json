    "description": "For this image the interaction between the physics of crystals construction and its visual impact through polarized lighting was what guided me.\n\nDesigned to spark the viewer's imagination, these photograph seamlessly explore the connection between science and the inherent artistic appeal of a natural phenomenon.\n\nThese clustered crystals were created from a chemical compound known as magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), these crystalline structure is formed through evaporation, as the water leaves the solution crystals begin to organize and appear at the bottom of the glass, growing in different directions and thicknesses.\n\nThese especially crystalline structure became the perfect element to create this striking abstract macro image that appear to be some kind aerial landscape from icy regions of another world.\n\nArtist: Bruno Militelli \nTitle: Sierra\nFormat: JPEG\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions:: 4158x6240px\nLicense: Extend Editorial\n",
