    "description": "De rerum natura is an uchronia where all the trees have disappeared. It is also a reflection on virtual worlds linked to the eponymous poem by Lucretius. The 3d objects are hollow, they are only membranes or barks. \n\n“Of all the objects there are what we call simulacras, kinds of lightweight membranes detached from the surface of the body, which fly in all directions in the air.\n… subtle figures and images are emitted by objects, and emerge from their surface: these images, let us give them by more or less the name of membranes or of bark, since each of them has the shape and appearance of the object, whatever it may be, including it emanates to wander through space. »\nLucrecius (written a first-century BC)",
