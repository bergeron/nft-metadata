    "description": "Never post shirtless on twitter. Never buy a yacht on credit. Never lever up on three bad trades in a row. Those are the lessons from Three Arrows Capital's epic fall from grace. By some accounts the 3AC founders, Su Zhu, and Kyle Davies may have squandered as much as $18 billion in AUM, after betting big (and bad) on GBTC, LUNA, and Staked ETH. We may not know the ultimate damage for years, but creditors claim they are owed up to $4 billion. Quite the turn of events for \"the smartest guys in the room.\"",
