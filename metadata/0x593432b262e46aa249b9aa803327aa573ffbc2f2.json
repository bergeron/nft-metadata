    "description": "Like a tree brutally uprooted from the verdant banks\nOf some swollen river that breached its borders,\nAnd carried away by swirling waters\nTo be cast into the endless ocean where all rivers end,\nLosing its leaves and limbs along the way\nTill all that’s left is a denuded trunk.\n\nNot resting yet, but wafted on the foam\nAlways on the move, to nowhere in particular\nJust drifting, riding the crest of wave after wave\nTouching one shore today, another tomorrow\nOft marooned by ebbing tides, and then buoyant again\nRammed against craggy rocks at times\nBattered and bruised, broken and beleaguered\nStrenuously striving yet, to stay afloat till\nAs time takes its toll and pieces fall off \nIt finds its final resting place\nScattered over the ocean floor\nTo be covered in course\nBy sediments of mud and muck and maritime life.\n\nSuch is the conundrum of being.\n\nDimensions: 6720 × 4480\nFile Size: 13.6 MB\nLocation: Marari Beach, Kerala",
