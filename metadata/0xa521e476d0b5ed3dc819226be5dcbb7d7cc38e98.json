    "description": "High above the crowded streets of New York City there exists a private oasis. A place unseen by most, and experienced by only a few. The few who have ventured out onto the rooftops of NYC to pursue beauty with our cameras. It is here above it all, where the air is thin and the views are spectacular, where this edition was shot. This is the view from a rooftop on 5th Ave between 16th and 17th Street.",
