    "description": "A Wild living European hamster (Cricetus cricetus) grabbing some clover on its way back from a successful foraging trip.\nThe European hamster is classified as critically endangered across its global range by the IUCN Red List and you won't find them easily in the wild, but they found refuge in some cities – like here in Vienna. It shouldn't be confused with pet hamsters, because they are twice their size and can get quite aggressive too. They can be fierce fighters – especially in mating season.\n15% of net profit will go directly to an organization taking care of wildlife in and around Vienna (very likely the IGL-Marchfeldkanal).",
