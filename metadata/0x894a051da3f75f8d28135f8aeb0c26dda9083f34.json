    "description": "I set up my artistic research with artificial intelligence - working with DALLÂ·E 2 - as a journey into my subconscious, staging only my imagination.\nI started looking for faces of couples that represented emotional situations.\nThis research involved me so much in the continuous and deepening iteration with artificial intelligence.\nI did not want to give definitions for the different types of couples.\nEach couple seems to have its own story, its own particular relationship, and I leave it to the viewer to interpret the looks on these faces, to be fascinated by them, as I was.\nThe stripes are the common feature, my \"signature\" on the photos.\nI accept facial imperfections as a feature of artificial intelligence.\nI called the collection \"Humans A.I.\", fascinated by these photographic portraits of people who do not exist, but are there, waiting for our gaze to return theirs.",
