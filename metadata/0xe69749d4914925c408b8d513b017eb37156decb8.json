    "description": "Photography is not so different from poetry because poetic indulgement can only bring justification to a beautiful vision.\n\nAlbatross is not a click that signifies only a dreamy morning but it shows two persons at opposite ends of a boat. And that’s the reason I clicked it. I found it so much relatable to life that the merit of the snap just increased 10 folds. We often compare our lives to boats, we being the master of our own sea but how many times do we consider that others are our co-passenger too? How many times do we stop to look at them, to hold their hands and to look deep in their eyes?\n\nAlbatross in real world signifies good luck and optimism to persons travelling in sea. Also, the strongest of patronus’ in the Harry Potter world. So let my Albatross be the good luck for you all to give that promise another go, try a little hard to hold on.\n\nLocation - Tripura, India\n\nEdition - 1/1\n\nDimension - 2711 x 3389\n\nCamera - Nikon D500\n\nYear - 2018\n\nLicense - Extended Editorial",
