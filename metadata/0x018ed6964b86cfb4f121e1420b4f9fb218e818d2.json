    "description": "The feelings of freedom, pleasure and the good life can be evoked by the imagery of the ocean, the women and the yacht. The ocean is often seen as a symbol of freedom and vastness, representing a sense of escape from the constraints of everyday life. The two women enjoying the sun on the coast also suggest a sense of leisure and pleasure, as they are depicted in a relaxed and carefree. yacht boat on the shore could symbolize luxury, relaxation, and leisure, as well as the connection between the ocean and the urban lifestyle.\n\n3500x3500 PXL  \nArtwork 2023",
