Also, for those who have “MANYFOLDS”, I will explore the burning mechanism soon for various editions or perks within the grand ecosystem. \n\n”://MANY-FOLD” is my collage attempt of manifold.xyz , memefi’ing them along with MANY-FOLDING a number of respectable communities I love. \n\nThis is truly life changing for me as it is a new approach in how I express myself and artwork within the web3 space. I definitely have plans to provide more value to those within the MAP ecosystem and branching out into more things moving forward. \n\nMuch love and thank you everyone for your love and support. Kindly share your minted OE of “://MANY-FOLD” and tag me on twitter and let’s get the MAP community together, strong. booyah !! \n\nY’all are amazing. Thank you.",
