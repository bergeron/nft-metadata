    "description": "Part 1.\n\nAll the clocks are broken, the time portal has just been destroyed, the shackles of time have been removed, and she stands there and says, \"It's OK\".\n- What does all this mean?\n- Do you know this rule? If you run, you stay where you are. And to get anywhere, you have to run as fast as you can. Time doesn't like the slow, time doesn't like the lazy.  The one who overcame the chessboard of life and left it last is usually the one who ran the most.\n\n",
