(Overseas, of course).\nThe NFTs will be issued on the ETH chain, and the animations will be stored in IPFS.\n\nBuddhist metal crafts created between 1950 and 1990 found dormant in the warehouse were chemically treated to regenerate them as the WABI-SABI Pot. This creates a collaboration between “past” and “present” craftspeople.",
