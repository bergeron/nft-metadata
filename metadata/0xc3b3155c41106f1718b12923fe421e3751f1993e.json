    "description": "The 'Look Mum' series of works are oil paintings of art collections, within which Zoë has painted her own piece. This is a painting of the collection itself. The idea for this came from her frustration with both the art world and the fact that she can no longer show her parents her work, due to them passing away. Zoë has used this method of surreal satire and Trompe l'oeil to create this alternative reality. This is the first ever Zoë Moss NFT as a premium digital artwork. This infinite video showcases a close up and infinite view of the painting, here you can see the full details from the original oil painting in a new style. Edition: 1 of 105",
