    "description": "A mighty angel with the ability to destroy anything. She has the power to control wind, thunder and hailstones. Wherever she strikes, nothing remains but rubble and wreckage.\n\nHer staff \"Stardust Focus\" is so powerful that it had taken her years to learn to wield it as she desires. Mortals have tried to obtain this staff numerous times. But the power is far too great for humans to even hold in their hands. The poor ones all burnt to ashes in an instant while still holding the staff.\n\nHer real name is Ranes, but most people fearfully call her the \"Storm Maker\".\n\n1/1 artwork created by Sutthiwat Dechakamphu aka TheRafa_Arts.",
