    "description": "Have you heard the song of flowers? Sometimes I listen to the spring and the sound of water like music. Children's voices mixed with these beautiful sounds is the name of the miracle, think everything is fresh. Because everything is set to be renewed. Nature renews itself, people change, animals change, flowers are renewed.\n\nDid you ever think they didn't exist? This photo was taken to make you think. Nature destroyed by man and a dried flower left in the hands of man. Factory chimneys, burned forests, waste, methane gas and that dirty smoke. Human is famous for self-destruct. A person uses the eraser in his/her hand like a spear, does not erase the writing on the paper, but tears the paper.\n\n",
