    "description": "Insane or maybe just misunderstood ….\nA breed that originally escaped from the infamous BEDLAM FOR THE UNBALANCED OVINE for whacked out sheep. \nThe institute for sheep suffering mind maggot was located in the dark ‘bloody hills’ of Salem county until it was burned and razed to the ground in 1866 by local nuns hopped up on holy spirit and miracle moonshine cocktails\n\nA mean rugged beast with the personality of an angry iceberg, it leaves a trail of frostbite.\nDelightfully unhinged and beautifully unbalanced with a touch of pop eye and prune head this sheep looks like its been slapped by life’s leather sap and shoe horned \n\nIt suffers continuous tics and twitches causing shakedowns and shoulder shrugs\nAlways a snappy dresser … but … beware …\nIt carries pockets full of eye pokes and face slaps.",
