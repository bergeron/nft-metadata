    "description": "Hokunohoaupuni rising over T큰t큰 Pele, the Milky Way rising over Madam Pele, the Goddess of Fire at K카lauea on The Big Island of Hawaii.  This was my bucket list shot, our first family vacation post pandemic, planned strategically with the eruption of K카lauea and a new moon.  \n\nThere are multiple benefits to creating a bucket list, setting goals and personal aspirations to help us feel accountable allowing us to thrive on the feeling of hope.  Finding hope when facing terminal illness is challenging but is also life sustaining while writing your last chapter.\n\nMy dear friend, Tara, diagnosed with multiple myeloma at age of 37,  is 1 year post stem cell transplant  & still on chemo as there is no cure for her disease. She has been unable to travel the last 10 years & I would like to take her on her bucket list trip. 100% of the funds from this sale will go towards her bucket list trip, the last she mentioned dreaming of  was Iceland.
