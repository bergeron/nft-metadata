    "description": "When I was 13 years old, I was diagnosed with a mental health illness - an eating disorder. At the time, I was in complete denial. As a 13-year-old, the word “mental illness” felt weird, taboo, and scary all at once and I refused to be labeled by it. I fought against my family, my doctors, and even myself until I finally decided to take the first step towards recovery. It wasn't easy, but it has definitely been worth it. It wasn't until I started sharing my story that I realized how much my disorder has shaped who I am today…and that is what “Chains” is all about..\n\nFor a long time, I felt a big disconnect between how I acted, and the person I wanted to embody/reflect. I’ve always been a firm advocate that our mind is our most powerful tool, and if we use it the right way we can overcome any obstacle and achieve anything we want to. Yet, there I was – being destructed and almost defeated by my own mind. It was this incongruence that inspired the song…\n\nI made this song for everyone that’s ever felt trapped in their own mind, unable to live authentically/true to who they are. “Chains” is a reminder that we can all chose to let go of the beliefs holding us back and decide to truly live. I want everyone who listens to the song to feel inspired to fight their own demons, and realize that sometimes, there’s beauty in all the chaos.\n",
