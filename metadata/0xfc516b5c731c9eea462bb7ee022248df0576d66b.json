    "description": "The source of energies, the concept did come to me while I started undertand and learning yoga\nspecifically when I started reading about the Kundalini\n\n\"A kundalini awakening is a challenging psychophysical episode, usually arising from prolonged engagement with religious or spiritual practices\"\n\nWhere we connect with the divine, through guided meditation and strict and controlled rules the energy is exposed to the person, the person experiences tremendous release of energy through him/ her and the life of that person will never be the same , he/she will experience pure blissness in his life \n\nThis is my visual representation of that experience\nThere are some details in it ,  \n1 ) It is feminine energy ( bottom female illustrated) \n2) Below world is the mortal world and above the celestial world indicating the ascend of the being\n3) Circle representing the perfect stored energy source and fold opening to the eye , connecting to the soul of the being\n\nlove\nvishwas/visualsbyv",
