    "name": "SP I: Self Destruction.",
    "description": "Self-destructive behaviors are those that are intended to harm you physically or mentally. \nThey may be involuntary. You may also know exactly what you are doing, but the urge is too strong to control. Self-harming behavior may be a coping mechanism that you did not realize you had developed.\nSelf-harming behavior is when you do anything that is bound to cause damage to yourself, either emotionally or physically. Some self-destructive behaviors are more obvious, such as :\nsuicide attempts, compulsive activities such as gambling, overuse of alcohol and drugs, or self-harm.\nMore subtle forms of self-sabotage also exist. \nYou may not realize you are doing it, at least on a conscious level. Some examples are\nself-deprecation, insisting that you are not smart enough, capable enough, or attractive enough.",
