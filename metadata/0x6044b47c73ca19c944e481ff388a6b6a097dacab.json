    "description": "PsycJoe is a psychedelic piece that captures the conflicted emotions of a rabbit who simultaneously loves and hates life. \n\nThrough vibrant colors and surreal imagery, it invites you to explore my inner world and my desire to break free from the confines of my mind. It is a reminder that even in the midst of turmoil and uncertainty, there is still beauty and wonder to be found.",
