    "description": "Hey there I‚Äôm Major WAV! I‚Äôve been making music for a brief 2 years but I‚Äôve always been very passionate about it knowing I would end up working in the industry in some capacity. I never thought it would be the role of the artist when I was younger but here we are.\n\n‚Äúcupids revenge‚Äù is a single off of my debut EP ‚ÄúFloral Arrangements‚Äù (which is out now) and really highlights a time in my life where I was single for a very long time just working on bettering myself. This went on for over a year and I felt ready to pursue a serious relationship again but I wasn‚Äôt actively seeking that out. I was just going with the flow until one day I met someone and little did I know I would fall deeply in love with her and she would be my girlfriend in just a couple short months. \n\nThe song is obviously about falling in love but more specifically it‚Äôs about the timing of the universe of putting that person in front of you at the right time and place. Thanks for taking the time to check this out and I hope you enjoy the track üíò",
