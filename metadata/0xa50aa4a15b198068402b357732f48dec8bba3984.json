    "description": "The windows reflected the rainbow after the summer rain. Once again, nature did not miss the chance to imprint its mark on man-made buildings. The windows showed waterfalls and the vibrant colors that only nature can create. We stared at this riot of color with our eyes wide open. It seemed as if the world of glass and concrete had stopped, but the forces of nature were relentlessly moving forward. I really wanted to live among this beauty and harmony. The world behind the glass convinced me that it was attainable.",
