    "description": "This photograph was taken in the surroundings of the Salar de Atacama, next to the Baltinache lagoons.\n\nDuring the day, the sun's rays heat the atmosphere and the gases that make it up. These gases are made up of atoms and molecules that, when in contact with the sun's radiation, trigger a process called photoionization. Photoionization consists in the fact that an electron from the atom receives enough energy for it to separate from it, leaving the atom ionized. At night, the solar radiation ceases to affect and the ionized atoms and electrons recombine and a photon is emitted. That is, light that we perceive as nocturnal luminescence and can vary from greenish colors to intense reds and oranges.",
