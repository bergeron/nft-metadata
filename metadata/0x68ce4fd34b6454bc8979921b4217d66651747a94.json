    "description": "On a long journey of lunar records I got this photo that means a lot to me since that was not the main objective and it was a completely unexpected click. Deserving to be the first work of this collection of moons. His name Prometheus.\n\nBecause this photo brought fire to ignite even more the desire that existed to register more things like this, which cannot be planned and require a lot of patience to complete.",
