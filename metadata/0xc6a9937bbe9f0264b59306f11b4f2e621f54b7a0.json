    "description": "\"24 Hours in Tokyo\" is my way to give back to all of those collectors who have supported the \"Seconds of Life\" collection. \n\nEach edition unlocks a physical screen that will have a custom-tailored version of their 1/1 piece which will be displayed on it perpetually.\n\nAs always I'm deeply grateful for your support, and I hope that this unlockable brings a part of Japan and my art to your home.\n\nIlan Derech\n\nTitle: 24 hours in Tokyo  \nBy: Ilan Derech  \nLocation: Kyoto, Japan  \nShot on: Leica M7 & ZEISS ZM 1.4/35  \nFilm: KODAK PORTRA 400  \nYear: 2022",
