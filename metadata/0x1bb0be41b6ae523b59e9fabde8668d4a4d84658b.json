    "description": "As the very first mint of the BLeUdles Collection, this 1/1 represents the birth of a definitive work of artists emerging on the blockchain.  \nBLeUdles are a collaborative collection of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that are made up of various unique artworks by Eli J Coleman with the cc0 visual trait known as \"BLeU\" designed by Johnatan \"Tjo\" Tabares. BLeUdles include variations of analog, blue watercolors and traits. The BLeUdles collection also includes dozens of rare interpretations of the artists' interpretations using BLeU as its \"foundation\".\nThe BLeUdles universe is ever-expanding with new collections spawning for its owners.\nOwning a BLeUdles allows you to participate in community-driven discovery. This makes our roadmap collaborative to be decided by the project founders and BLeUdles collaborators. Minted on Foundation, BLeUdles is our building block to added community experiences exclusively throughout the blockchain.",
