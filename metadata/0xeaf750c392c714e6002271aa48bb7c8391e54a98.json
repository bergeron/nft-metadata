    "description": "Sulautuja (the one who blends) is amalgamation of mythology, glitch and abstract patterns. Artwork can be seen as a representation of the cyclical nature of life, and the interconnectedness of all things in the natural world.  \n\nSulautuja is a work that invites us to question our assumptions about the nature of art in relation to artificial intelligence, and the nature of representation itself.",
