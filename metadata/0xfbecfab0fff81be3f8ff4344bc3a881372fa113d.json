    "description": "Made with red and blue ink, with dip pen and brush.\n\nI drew this rooster trying to release my stress from working nonstop at a temp job during the peak of covid crisis.\n\nI found it so hard to be that preoccupied with work that didn't allow me to draw whenever I wanted.\nI felt as though I lost my  voice.\n\nThis Rooster is my scream - I AM HERE!\n\nIt was also sooo much fun drawing it!\nChallenging me in every technical aspect of it - It helped me take my mind off being so busy at my day job.\n\nDimensions - 3500*2559 Pixels",
