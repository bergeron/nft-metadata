    "description": "There were two main sources of inspiration behind \"Pepesco Totti\".\nThe first was my personal connection to the legendary footballer Francesco Totti, who was not only an idol of my childhood but also a symbol of loyal and commitment to his hometown of Rome.\nTotti refused offers from top-tier EU clubs throughout his career, SACRIFICING (and therefore, making sacred) his personal achievements, to become a popular legend.\n\nThe second source of inspiration was the culture of Pepe. Few know that my IRL nickname has always been \"pepe\" - by Giuseppe.\nI've always been fascinated by the internet culture and it's phenomena, and pepe may be it's biggest expression.\nPepe is for the people, like Totti. We are all pepe.\n\nPepesco Totti is my first 1/1 minted, representing my personal journey. \nA remix between two places: my roots - Rome, and the place where I've chosen to commit in the years to come - the digital communities of the decentralized online world.\n\nMixed media, 2597 × 3387px.\n\n",
