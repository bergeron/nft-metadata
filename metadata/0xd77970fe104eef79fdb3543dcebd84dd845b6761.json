    "description": "In the spring of 2020, the COVID pandemic tore through the world and dramatically changed the lives of billions. \n\nLike many people around the world, New Yorkers were forced to spend months trapped inside their small apartments. \n\nThe industrious TPigeon passed the time by hanging out on his rooftop. He viewed the city from above with his sharp artist's eye, while he waited for his opportunity to migrate. \n\nOwn a piece of history by picking up 1 of 25 editions of this rare photo of this majestic creature. \n\n50% of all proceeds will be donated to the Save the TPigeons Foundation*\n\n*Disclaimer: The Save the TPigeons Foundation is not a real charity. ETH that has been earmarked for the foundation will be deposited in Tibalism's wallet. https://twitter.com/Tibalism",
