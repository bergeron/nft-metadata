    "description": "This collection, \"The Body Remembers The Score\", is a self reflection on healing the inner child. As I struggle with mental health, suicide attempts and ideation, and low self worth, I decided to do my first self portrait session to mark the occasion of growth and healing the inner child. I started to understand how, while traversing through the valleys, a journey of healing cannot be complete until you heal the inner child. As you both walk through this journey, you remember the trauma, the sexual and verbal assault, you remember the moments. As I walked through the valleys, looking towards the peaks of healing, my inner child comes with me. Healed.\n\n\nAs I walk through the valleys of healing, I bring my younger self with me. Troubled, tired, she stays with me. Wide eyes, curiosity, seeking shelter. How will I protect her as I heal me?",
