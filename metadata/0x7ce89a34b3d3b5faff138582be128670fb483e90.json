    "description": "FUSION is my first ever animated collection. With nearly 15 years experience as a photographer and 5 as a florist, the creative fire has been ignited, bringing you moving images to collect and trade.\n\nIn winter 2022 I joined the NFT community and wanted to create something totally new instead of pulling old work from my archives. You could say I was feeling a certain type of way about my journey as a florist after being out of work for 2 whole years. I've always wanted to bring my photos to life, so I took this as an opportunity to merge my two passions and learn something new. I hope you enjoy it!",
