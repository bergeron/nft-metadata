    "description": "The dish was not the usual kind. That jelly-like, seaweed-derived stuff that we were all used to from high school: no deal to these guys. They did not eat it and they did not reproduce in it. What more to expect from things that swam and spun and danced inside a drop of liquid sulphur? Hardly surprising they had no stomach (figuratively speaking, of course) for agar. \n\nThe plastic too – those little round trays – no good. They, or something they secreted, burnt through it in just over seventy-nine seconds. Glass lasted a little longer. The stuff we built the on-surface domes out of lasted the longest. It held up to their air… made sense it held up to their waste excretions. That, after all, was what had created their atmosphere in the first place. \n\nMay 2022-August 2022, digital illustration.",
