    "description": "Inspired by historical mafia crime bosses, I added my own touch to the technological design we're familiar to while keeping it recognizable. It's the first character in the series with a sense of style and looks that mirror mine, from the HOMER inspired jewelry to the sneaker head attitude, and he's the one calling all the shots in this violent universe.  \nThe posture was inspired by a shot i took of my friend three years ago for a project I never got around to finishing until now.",
