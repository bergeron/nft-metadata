Of them we should feel proud but you are not a tree, you can decide to move and take root in another\nplace.\n\nAs one moves into the future, the way loudest and \nclearest way to do it is if you have a good sense of \nits past and origin.\n\nThere are only two lasting legacies we can hope for\ngive our children. One of them is roots, the another, wings to fly high.",
