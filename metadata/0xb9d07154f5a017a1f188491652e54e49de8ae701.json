    "description": "There was a large fig tree in the backyard of my grandfather's house that produced several kilos of figs every year during the fig season.\nAfter my grandfather passed away, the tree became an obstacle to dividing the land properly. We didn't know what happened, but suddenly it dried out. Some said salt was poured under it, some said urine, and others said boiling water. Regardless, the tree dried out.\nHowever, several years passed until the tree sprouted again from its previous spot.",
