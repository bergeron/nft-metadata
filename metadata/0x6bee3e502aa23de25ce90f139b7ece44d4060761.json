    "description": "Self-portrait with headphones and nose-up lifting shaping clip. From Body Care series. 2016.\n\nFormally, it is a series of selfâ€”portraits and irony over the genre of a ceremonial portrait, but also a visual statement about the naive nature of modern man's perception of his physicality. This is a project about collective hysteria, which arises on the basis of global consumption and unjustified expectations.",
