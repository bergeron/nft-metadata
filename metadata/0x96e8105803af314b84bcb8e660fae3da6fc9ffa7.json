    "description": "'bedaya' - Arabic for beginning - threads the Arabic alphabet into an interconnected seam of repetitive forms. Language is the foundational basis to communicate and create understanding for living beings. In turn, my debut collection of moving images with sound is analogous with my beginning to understand and communicate through the blockchain, a new medium that is deriving meaning from open spaces and creative expression; weaving threads of community to intertwine people for the greater good.\n\n'bedaya' is created in collaboration with nullsight.\n\nbedaya #4\n00:10\n1080 x 1080, mov\nApril 2022\n1/1",
