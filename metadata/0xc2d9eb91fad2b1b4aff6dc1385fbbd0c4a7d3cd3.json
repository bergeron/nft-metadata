    "description": "I was born in Ukraine and moved to Saint-Petersburg, Russia, in 2013 and then married there a few years later. On the night of 19.02.22, I had a dream that I was walking in the underground of Kharkiv. It was green and had become darker and darker. In the dream, I was trying to use my phone flashlight but the darkness is so dense that I still couldn’t see anything. Then, I understand — there is no way out and I will never come back. Then, I suddenly woke up. After this dream, I finally decided to return to Ukraine to be there if the war starts.",
