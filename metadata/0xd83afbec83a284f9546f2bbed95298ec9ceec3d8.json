    "description": "The Bottle is a glitched up graphic statistic about the over consumption of plastic bottles. When I was researching the SDG effortâ€™s, I came across a fact in Goal 14 that inspired me.  Around the world, 1,000,000 plastic bottles are consumed every minute. I have seen plastic bottles litter streets, fields, and beaches for years, but the number of purchased bottles per minute floored me.\n\nMy goal was to represent the repetitive cycle of plastic bottle consumption.  The bells dings and a new bottle appears on the screen.  The water is consumed, and the bottle is crushed.  Another bell and another bottle.  The cycle repeats.",
