    "description": "My first NFT is a small city in the internet called City Jubilee without a lot of walls where we can see windows into other places like the outside world that is sideways. It is based on a collage from “Miss Information Progression” (2007-17), a series of works where I wanted to explore a landscape for lived relations that are not normally visible. Collaging from details found in magazines, structures build towards the next found fragment and grow that way. I move from within the space of the page to the space of the web to see what is around it.",
