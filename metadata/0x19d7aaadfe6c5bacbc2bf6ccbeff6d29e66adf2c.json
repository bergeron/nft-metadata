    "description": "'Sarah Words' by Irish artist Sarah Woods is a collection combining her writing and her IRL abstract paintings. This unique collection will live on the Blockchain, acting as a stand alone digital asset while providing access to discounts on Sarah's physical art prints.  For example, when purchasing a token through the manifold contract, there is a hidden code in the metadata that will give the owner a 15% discount to use on my online store, sarahwoods.net \n\nSarah Words tokens may vary in style and will be available on multiple platforms at various prices to allow anyone and any budget to enjoy her work. For example, the open editions sold on Objkt is sort of like her journal that sells a more simple style of her writing. \n\nFor open editions of 'Sarah Words' please check out my collection on Objkt.com as well as joining my Discord to catch the many discount codes and giveaways that I do. Both links are in my linktree link provided. Thank you so much for supporting my art.",
