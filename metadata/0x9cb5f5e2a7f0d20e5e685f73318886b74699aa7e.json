    "description": "We are all a resource - in the future. AI gave birth to this unearthly art, while we control it .. But this is not for long. All cyborgs are punks, all punks are cyborgs.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nIs a project that demonstrates the possibility of cooperation between Artificial Intelligence and human in art. If you asked me 5 years ago \"Could I be friends with AI and make art together?\" I would say \"What the hell?\". Now the time has changed and technological solutions have entered our lives. It would be foolish to deny the interaction with AI in the creation of beauty.",
