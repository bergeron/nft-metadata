    "name": "Crypto Saints #12 Against War!",
    "description": "Today in my democratic country Ukraine there is a war with Russian aggressors.  My idea of ​​creating a new epic for the Metavers took on new meaning.  Saints Crypto today guard the life, health and future of my country.  All proceeds from the sale will be transferred to the fund to help my fellow citizens.\nMy Saints Crypto were created from nature itself with the help of digital technology and artificial intelligence.  Their stylistic similarity with the masks of African tribes refers us to the history of proto-humanity, which emerged from the African continent 200 thousand years ago.  As an artist, this thought inspires me, pushes me to draw unifying lines from the distant past to the future.",
