    "description": "“I went down a million stairs, at least, arm in arm with you and now that you are not here, I feel a vacuum at each step. Our long journey was brief, though. \n\nMine still lasts, but I don’t need any more connections, reservations, traps, humiliation of those who think reality is what we are used to see.  \n\nI went down a millions of stairs, at least, arm in arm with you, and not because with four eyes we see better that with two. \n\nWith you I went downstairs because I knew, among the two of us, the only real eyes, although very blurred, belonged to you.”\n\nEugenio Montale",
