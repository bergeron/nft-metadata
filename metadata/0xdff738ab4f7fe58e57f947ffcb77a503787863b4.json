    "description": "\"Aging Together\" is a 6 second video by new media artist Sa1ntDenis. The work showcases a colorized archive photo from the artist's family album, depicting the artist's great grandfather and his wife sitting on a bench and slowly aging together. The photo was taken during their time in France as emigrants. Through this piece, Sa1ntDenis explores the theme of the passage of time and the enduring nature of love and commitment. The use of archival footage and colorization adds a sense of nostalgia, inviting viewers to reflect on their own experiences and relationships.",
