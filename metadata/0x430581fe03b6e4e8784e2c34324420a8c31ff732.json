    "description": "Las luces de mis errores nos traen aquí, atraviesan el pecho y llenan mis ojos de fuego buscando el futuro - \nVAL SCHNACK\n\n-------  \nCIEGA from the series HODT\n\nScanned 120mm negative film, this piece exists in physical form as a print with handwriting.  \n-------\n\n'Herself and Other Difficult Tasks' is a poetic visual diary that explores the photographer’s states of vulnerability and growing pains. It contains a selection of photographs taken between 2020 and 2022, which somewhat organizes a non-linear journey that she goes through during the lapse of time where her sense of self was cracked open and dislocated to create space for re-recognition. \nwords by Mana Pinto",
