    "description": "As with all of the photographs in this collection, this is NOT a computer generated image but a \"long exposure\" photograph, typically measured in minutes rather than fractions of a second. Details of the settings used for this particular photograph are further below.\n\nTo create the photograph, the camera and LED source are on separate pendulums which are set in motion. In this case, the ratio between the pendulum frequencies was close to a 3:2 ratio and in the same rotational direction. \n\nEven minor differences in the ratios, speed, orientations or amplitudes lead to very different images.\n\nThe colouration comes from the LED which was set to sweep through the rainbow at almost the same period as the faster pendulum, leading to the colours grouping together within the photograph.\n\nMinimal editing has been done in Lightroom in order to crop the image, remove hot pixels and balance some of the colour.\n\nSettings:\nCanon R5 + EF16-35 f/4 IS on Canon mount adapter \nISO800, \n35mm, \nf/5.6,\n121s",
