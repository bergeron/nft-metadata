    "description": "This is the first piece of an extensive collection in which I seek to tell small stories bathed in a melancholic and abstract air. Lines are the unique aesthetic style that has accompanied me throughout my own search and here I reinforce it (once again).\nThe ego must die is a piece that seeks to reflect the illusion of identity, where a denied face dissolves in the company of many. Equality before unity at the moment when we get rid of the personality. All bodies are connected to each other, none is separated, because none is autonomous in real essence.\nWelcome to my imagination.",
