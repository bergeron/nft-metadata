    "name": "Porsche 993 Cup Body Line",
    "description": "While shooting this legendary 1995 Porsche 993 RSR 3.0, I had the thought to light paint it and showcase the body lines of the car. A vehicle itself is a work of art, and I'm blessed enough to be able to showcase that art through my own art. The 1990's Porsches were especially beautiful. This particular 993 Cup was the last one to leave the factory and has been in private collections and museums ever since. Just after photographing this particular one, it was shipped to the Philippines to it's newest owner, and may never be seen in the US again. This piece inspired my future collection, \"Body Lines\" but I always wanted this piece to be a special 1/1.\n\nSpecial shoutout to @CoopNFT for helping me with this shoot!",
