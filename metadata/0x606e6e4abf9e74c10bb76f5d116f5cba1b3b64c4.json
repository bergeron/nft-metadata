    "name": "Spring Caretaker",
    "description": "This beautiful creature wakes up only at the beginning of spring. She likes to sleep, which is why sometimes spring comes so late. But when she opens all her eyes, she vigilantly watches and protects so that every spring leaf, every warm breath of wind is safe...She closely monitors compliance with all spring laws and plans, and if she notices any violations, she resets the levels, covering the area with a snow blanket. The spring caretaker loves to walk and look at the world, flowers bloom where her foot comes. She is invisible to the eye, but her presence is always palpable, her protection is always assured. She is beautiful and she is divine.",
