    "name": "Trudging Through Wilderness",
    "description": "Lord Ram was exiled to the forest for 14 years, where his beautiful wife Sita, and younger brother Lakshman accompanied him. \nThe trio witnessed many scenic moments amidst their journey through the wilderness. Even though they became tired by continuously making their way amidst the wilderness, they kept walking.\nThis painting tries to manifest the picturesque scene where they could have come across in the course of their long journey.\nRealizing how the wood can be slippery, Ram holds Sita's hand firmly as they cross the bridge formed by the dead fallen tree. Lakshman walks behind, carrying a huge leaf, to shelter Sita and Ram from sunlight. \nThe Nature bursts in ecstasy on witnessing the arrival of these three beautiful souls, and unfurls a rainbow near the foot of waterfall.\nThis art piece has been digitally drawn on Procreate app.\nMay the soothing vibes emanating from this painting calm you down!\n",
