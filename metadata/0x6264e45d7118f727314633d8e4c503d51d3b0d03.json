    "description": "This is a Genesis Tasty Toasty that is pending migration to their OG holders for the Tasty Toastys collection. Migration will be carried out by the project team when enough funds have been raised for this exercise, e.g. completion of the sale of the entire collection. The project team does not want the community to fork out any additional costs, hence this stopgap measure. Tasty Toastys is a limited edition collection of 7,600 NFTs that live on the Ethereum blockchain.  Tasty Toastys is the first digital product line derived from Toasty, a lifestyle brand founded on the philosophy of sharing warm and toasty feelings, with people from all walks of life.
