    "description": "\"Space War\" is the second collection of AI-generated artwork by Libertas. Shocked by the chaos and anxiety around the world now, this collection includes 888 unique art pieces and hopes to remind us how beautiful a peaceful world should be. As governments are expanding territories with threats, weapons and even wars, the hearts of people are broken at the same time. We hope to use art to unite and bring peace to all generations."
