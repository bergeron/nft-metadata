    "description": "Charitable project to help Ukraine. 80% of the money from the sale of each NFT (and further from royalties) is converted into BTC and transferred to the wallet of the Ukrainian Army, after the end of the war to restore the country and help the victims. Screenshots of transactions will be published on our social networks, links in bio. 20% will be used to create the next collections to help Ukraine. NFTs have a huge range of prices so that everyone can contribute according to their opportunity. It's time to act, not just pray.",
