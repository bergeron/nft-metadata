    "description": "We live connected in a parallel world where we share our emotions, feelings and images where we need the interaction of \"likes\" from other avatars to find safety and comfort. \n\nMore than 1,000 blue and white balloons were attached to cover the surface of two canvases of 50 cm x 70 cm each.\n\nThe canvases burn to create an uncontrolled plastic meltdown that distorts the image to symbolize the labile and false gratification that people have in sharing and receiving LIKEs from their virtual friends. \nThe ego burns but only ashes remain at the end.",
