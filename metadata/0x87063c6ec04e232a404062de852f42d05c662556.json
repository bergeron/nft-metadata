    "description": "Kenny Scharf's Emoshow explores the value of emotions by experiencing and sharing the creative process of understanding and expressing them. People often feel and express the same emotions differently depending on their circumstances. Likewise, Emoshow holders can create multiple image NFTs of Kenny's Moodz series, the basis of the Emoshow by Kenny Scharf collection, in different colors. You can even name these newly created image NFTs however you see fit. Build relationships by sharing these NFTs to people you care about. Perhaps they could become your Emoshow neighbor.\r\nWe have prepared an Emoshow Village where Emoshow holders can inhabit with their wonderful neighbors. Surround yourself with beautiful people, and share your feelings with like-minded folks. While you enjoy the perks of having wonderful people around you, they might bring you revenue in the future.",
