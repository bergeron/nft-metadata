    "description": "Shot during the December 14th 2020 Total Solar Eclipse, this image captured the moment of totality as the Moon completely covered the Sun, turning day into night and revealing the Sun's faint outer atmosphere. High altitude clouds added an eerie, surreal overtone to the event as the great eye in the sky stared down upon us. \n\nBattling against 80 km/h wind gusts, dust storms and even rain during the partial phases of the eclipse, the observation campaign in Patagonia proved to be a taxing and extremely demanding endeavour both for myself and my equipment which required heavy servicing after the event. The morning of the eclipse the sky was deeply overcast, and as totality approached small clearings popped up in the clouds. When the time came a gap opened in the lower clouds and I was able to capture the event in one of the most intense make or break moments in my astrophotography career.",
