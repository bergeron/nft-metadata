    "description": "Thursday Dec 2nd 2021, adidas Originals revealed their leap into The Metaverse, announcing a four way collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney & Punks Comic. As part of the announcement the three stripes introduced their own \"rebellious optimist\" ape, Indigo Herz (BAYC #8774).\n\nSignature Sneaker 'Indigo Herz' not only takes on the name, but also the traits and visual aesthetic from the adidas owned Ape. The Blue Fur, Fisherman's Hat and Heart Shaped Glasses are the obvious features, but an additional detail is the sole color, which nods to the Firebird Tracksuit worn by the three characters in the collaboration trailer.",
