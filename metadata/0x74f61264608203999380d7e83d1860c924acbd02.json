    "description": "Happiness and anger, sadness and excitement, all rush in together. All elevated emotions in one moment and absolute emptiness in the next. Inexplicably grateful, confused, happy, and amused. Is it possible to feel all this together, when all tormenting thoughts, memories, and glimpses of the past are rushing in? Which emotion is true, which memories are authentic, life feels beautiful, and living feels horrific, these fluctuations make seem everything unreal, untrue, and everything conquerable yet everything so vain?\n\n -  \"BIPOLAR DISORDER\" is a piece by Manisha Sikdel",
