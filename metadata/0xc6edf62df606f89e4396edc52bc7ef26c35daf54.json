    "description": "seabed, a painting🎨~\n\nthis image means a lot to me as it was one of the first times I really dove into a painting's potential depth and felt it flow in such an exciting natural way. my attempts before were often more surface-level.\n\ni look fondly back upon it because of how fluid and confident i felt about that deep-dive, and how fun and positive it was to feel how it connected with all of my friends and community.\n\ni felt excited to be able to take people on a journey to vivid imagined worlds to appreciate them with me and share in the peace and wonder.\n\ni invite you to join in on the journeys i wish to continue to share and connect through🙏~\n\nthankyou 😌\ntake good care, cheers~",
