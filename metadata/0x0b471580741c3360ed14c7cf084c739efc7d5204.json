    "description": "As our first NFT collection, we will focus on honoring one of the most prominent and highest selling, post-mortem, Black painters and artists of all time, Jean Michael-Basquiat, in collaboration with Animation artist, and musician HighWestHus.\n\nThese generative pieces will include elements inspired by his signature style of abstract expressionism, while also including attributes representing diversity and inclusion. Effectively giving our platform an aesthetic identity outside of our economic structure and mission, while also providing initial liquidity to treasury and LPs.",
