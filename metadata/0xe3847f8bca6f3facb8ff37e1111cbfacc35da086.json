    "name": "FANUCO",
    "description": "“Fanuco” is a portrait painting on canvas.The word meaning of “Fanuco” is “A man with freedom’’.  Fanuco is a common man. The hard and bold strokes on his face speak us about his rich and vivid life experiences. There is no real person called Fanuco but there was an inspiring face behind this painting whom I met while I was on a road journey. I used warm colors to portray his face.                                    This collection named “Bold Strokes’ has 6 acrylic portraits of old people who represents different communities and culture. I used bold strokes to paint these faces. The wrinkles on their faces are bold and beautiful. The patches on these faces are the manifestations of their life experiences. They have travelled a long way and still ready to travel a long way with lots of courage. I find lots of life in these faces. They are epics. We have to look and read their bold strokes and experience their life journey. ",
