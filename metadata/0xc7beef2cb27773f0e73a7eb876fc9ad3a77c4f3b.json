    "description": "This metaphoric image, Depicts my personal creative process. Or to be more specific, my first step in any & all creations I have ever made.  And before I ever touch a pencil to paper, it all starts in my crazy mind. Ever since I was young, I would get these flashes of beautiful worlds and images I have never seen before in my life. Only after this process in my head has been \"shown to me\"  the actual creation begins... \n\nThis image shows myself on a mountain peak, looking at an impossible view of NYC above the clouds fading into a bright sky where anything is possible! I believe this is a great representation of my metaphoric thought process when I first start the creation of a new piece.",
