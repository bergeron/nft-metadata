    "description": "Every time I look at the sun, I get the feeling that the world is so much bigger than we are. There are things that are bigger than us, processes that are bigger than us but still we are an important part of the world. The sun sets every day and we hustle all our lives every day just have a happy ending. \n\nSunsets are a proof that endings can be beautiful too! \n\n\nDetails  ~\nArtist: Rohit Tandon\nEdition: 1/1\nLocation: Goa, India (2022)\nShot on: Sony A6400\nDimensions: 3741x4676\nCollection: Around the world with @yayavaar",
