Next set Release Date 12/10.\n\nThe world is a beautiful place. So full of color, and life. And what's more, it's all made up of geometric abstract shapes. God looks down upon the world, and sees nothing but perfection. Each shape is placed perfectly in relation to the others, forming a harmonious whole.\n",
