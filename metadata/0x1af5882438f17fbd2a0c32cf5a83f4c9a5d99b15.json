    "description": "Suffering from autism, Sam, like other autistic people daydreamed a lot. He used to see whales everywhere. Others only criticized his behavioral and called it a time waste but he loved it. Though his different way of seeing the world does had some downside , it is this along with his heightened ability to observe things landed him a job in an astronomical observatory as a stargazer. The whales spoke to him in a language only he could understand, sharing secrets of the universe that he alone could uncover. It was then that Sam realized his autism was not a hindrance, but a gift that allowed him to see things others couldn't.",
