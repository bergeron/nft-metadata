    "description": "This 1/1 photo taken from a helicopter represents A \"highway interchange\" in the city of Montpellier. I chose this aerial point of view to show what the urbanism looks like from above and unfortunately there is no name of architect for this work. I have a passion for highway interchanges. I find that they all have a particular shape and when we look at them from above they often remind us of known shapes as for the other photos of this collection. The question is: what does this highway interchange make you think of? A butterfly? A clover? Only the architect knows and for us it remains the imagination, each one interprets it as he wants.",
