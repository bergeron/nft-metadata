    "description": "Sky Pods, created by  A0K1VERSE, in collaboration with oncyber and Inferstudio, are the next step into the A0K1 metaverse. \nThe pods represent a virtual home that can be used to display art, listen to music, and gather with friends. \nThe Phantom Sky Pod features a gallery ring with room to display 35 works, multi-level living spaces, a gravity-defying pool, and a mixing studio with a performance platform and open-plan floor area. Phantom pods fuse the typologies of apartment and art gallery, with an interior design that is completely distinct from the preceding passport tiers. A variety of nooks, shelves, and curved walls can accommodate vast and diverse digital art collections and the interior spaces are textured in dramatic charcoal blacks, with incorporated sub-surface scattering materials. \nThese pods also feature oncyberâ€™s Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material system allowing for realtime dynamic reflections, reflecting the concept that in virtual worlds it is computational complexity rather than physical properties that determines material value. The Phantom pods are suspended amidst surrounding high altitude clouds, and at night they reveal tinges of a green aurora under a starry sky.\n\nBy purchasing this space, you gain access to use it as a 3D exhibition for your digital assets on oncyber.io",
