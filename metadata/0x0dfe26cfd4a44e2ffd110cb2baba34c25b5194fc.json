    "description": "This is one of my favorite self portraits. It reflects my desire to finally calm my anxieties and calm down. But this is not possible. I'm 18 years old. Now my country is under threat of destruction, as well as hundreds, thousands of talented artists. Some of them could be the future of our country, but are dying under the rubble after the bombing. I'll send 50% of the sale of my works to the needs of Ukraine. ",
