    "description": "Description – the name of the work, at the same time its essence and its constituent\nelement, does the word contain the essence of things, or is it a contract of the parties?\nTwo–dimensional space is our three–dimensional vision presented on\na plane - a 3-dimensional model scan embodied in two-dimensional printing\non silk. Three-dimensional space is a 3D model printed on a 3D\nprinter. The work is a demonstration and research, but can be\ncreated under an individual request.\nThe NFT itself is a collection, the sum of all media and media, each of them\nit is a fixation of reality, but each has its own limitations and\ndoes not fully describe it.The deconstruction of form has led to the study\nof ways of describing and deconstructing meanings.\nThe process of exploring the form through different mediums shows that\neach of the variants is a self-sufficient work of art, but at the\nsame time does not fully describe reality.",
