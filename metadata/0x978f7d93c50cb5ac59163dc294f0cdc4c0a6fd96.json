    "description": "Paper blob is an otherworldly creature that feeds on old books. It is a small, amorphous creature, barely larger than a book itself. It has eyes, mouth, and other features.\n\nWhen it comes across an old book, it will attach itself to the book and start to devour it. The book will slowly disintegrate as the paper blob consumes it. The creature seems to take particular joy in destroying ancient and valuable books.\n\nSome believe that paper blob is a manifestation of the anger of the old gods, who are upset at the way humans have forgotten them. Others believe that it is a force of chaos, which delights in destruction for its own sake. Whatever the truth may be, paper blob is a deadly foe of old books.",
