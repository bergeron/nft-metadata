    "description": " Before we could only watch them on television, and today they are all around us â€“ even children operate them. Drones fly where a man cannot or does not want to go. They are used for crop pollination and supervision, delivery, entertainment, but also for serious military actions. Drones are the technology of the future that lives in our present. Today, they are being tested and used to carry mail, and to deliver medicines to recipients in the remote and hard to reach. Packages descending from the sky are not the thing from the future anymore.",
