    "description": "The early bird catches the worm so the saying goes. This is the tale of our young fisherman and his travails on the muddy Riverside getting splashed by the murky waters as he hunts for his daily bread. He watched the light of the sunrise at dawn on his boat, he felt the heat of the sun smack his face at noon as he rowed into deeper waters  and he saw the sun setting at dusk while at shore. Here, hard work meets heritage handed over from fathers to sons. Here intensity of motivation meets stamina of motivation, without pulling in the haul, hunger pangs threatens his dear ones. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown and turbulence lies the hand that casts the net. \nThere is dignity in labour, he was told as a child; for “It is only through labor and painful effort, by grim energy and resolute courage, that we move on to better things”",
