    "description": "Work information. Technique: Oil and tempera and gold leaf on canvas. Dimensions: 80x120cm Year: 2023 Artist: Gilson Bezerra Geometric abstraction. Used colors: Blues, greens, oranges, reds and violets. All of my work over the last 15 years has been structured around abstract art. Both lyrical and geometric abstraction. Geometric abstraction, over the years, has solidified in my work. This work here is part of a series of paintings where I used the same technique: oil, tempera and gold leaf on canvas. It is a painting where color and geometric shapes come together to convey peace, harmony and inner healing to the people who observe it.",
