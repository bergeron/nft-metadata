    "description": "“To Infinity and Beyond !” Is one of my first panorama of northern lights but my absolute weirdest. Everything happens by accident. For that work, I was only supposed to practice. And then I saw this huge growing arch, I noticed the red aurora and the milky way. So I decided to do it more seriously. \n\nThis is a panorama of 9 shots.",
