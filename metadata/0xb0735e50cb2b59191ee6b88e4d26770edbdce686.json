Hear Me Out!!!  \nI'm pushed out of the group because I'm perceived as different. \nI'm labelled a misfit because I'm unusual and \"something\" might be wrong with me.  \nYou call me a black sheep because I'm not the usual.  \nThe jokes on you though.  \nBecause I'm not scared to be my weird unique self.  \nI'm strong because even when talked about, I continue in my path.  \nI've embraced my uniqueness and I'm loving this weirdness.  \nYes I'm a misfit, but I didn't chose to be.  \n I'm just it and I'm not sorry.",
