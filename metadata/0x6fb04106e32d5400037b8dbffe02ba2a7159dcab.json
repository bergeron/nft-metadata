    "description": "Infrared can be confusing... Many times, I've been asked if it was day or night, winter or summer...\n\nThis piece is a timeless composition using infrared light. The result is a black-and-white image that confuses the viewer by not knowing if it's taken by day or night.\n\n\n// Process\n\nThe foreground and the tree have been captured around 12 am, at 850nm, under a bright sun. The stars around 12 pm, in visible light, during a dark night. The filter  IR 850 nm, lets only infrared light hit the sensor and create a true black-and-white image. The bright blue sky, which doesn't reflect infrared, appears dark and was perfect to add the Milky Way.\n\n\n// About the NFT\n\nArtist's name: Jonas Hangartner | J0n45.eth  \nTitle: M1DN16H7 5UN (pronounce Midnight Sun)  \nEdition: 1/1\n\nAvailability: NFT and print (edition of 10) \nResolution: 3744 x 5616 px  \nCoordinates: 46.583614, 6.469248\n\n\n// About the artist\n\nHi, my name is Jonas Hangartner, a photographer from Switzerland.
