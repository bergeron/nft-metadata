    "description": "The lands pulse with pools of darkness and shadow, almost cold to the touch and yet alive. Out of the Void steps the Worlokk cloaked with hat and cape, but covered in shadow. His arrival is no coincidence. He has scoured many worlds with his void magic in search of something most dear to him - conquering civilisations across the cosmos in his unquenchable quest for power. Over the aeons, the Worlokk has traveled far and wide. Now he is ready to spread chaos and shadow in the lands of Geoda, amassing an army to flatten the world until he finds answers to questions he has long searched for. But until now he has not encountered a land, ready and willing to defend itself as stoutly as the warriors of Geoda. Yet he is ready to unleash his full might upon the lands.",
