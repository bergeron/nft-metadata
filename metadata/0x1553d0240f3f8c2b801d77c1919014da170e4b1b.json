    "description": "An aspect of photography that I love is that it has the power to play with your imagination while visually transporting you to a destination far away. Like many of my other salt lake images, capturing this kind of photo takes days of planning, although nothing could have prepared me for the abundance of colours I was met with at this particular location. \n\nAfter travelling for hours deep into the Western Australia outback, the intricate patterns of this salt lake made me feel like I was on a whole new world and looking at the layers of a planet. The long shadows made by the trees really put into perspective how vast and barren this landscape is. ",
