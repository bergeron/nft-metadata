    "description": "GiveWell Inu presents to you...through a vision brought about by the one and only Vitalik Buterin himself, a 1 of 1 collection of our Utility NFCTs.  Coined 'Non-Fungible Charity Token', each are individually unique aesthetically but all retain the same function of use.   This new form of charitable NFT will give it's holders the ability to receive ETH rewards from our very own GINU Swap.  Under the umbrella of our Proof of Giving Ecosystem, these NFCTs will not only reward their holders, but the proceeds and the creator's fees will donate to GiveDirectly Foundation as well.  GiveWell Inu is promoting a healthier future for crypto and we will be saving lives along the way!",
