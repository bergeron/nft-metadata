    "description": "Dear Anna tells a story of inner conflict and of inner peace. It speaks of the mindâ€™s complexities and the ever-changing relationship we have with self. Some days love becomes hate, hate becomes fear, fear becomes insanity, insanity becomes passion and passion becomes love. \n\nOur inner conflicts are often the catalyst for transformation and for growth, but can also be the weight that drowns us into shadow and darkness. Others often serve as mirrors, as the reflection of the depth of our minds, but sometimes that inner voice is all we need.\n\nAll images in the collection were photographed in camera on one single exposure; no post-editing was used to create any effects.\n",
