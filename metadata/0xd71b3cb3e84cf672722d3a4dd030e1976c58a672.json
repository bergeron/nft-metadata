    "name": "The Southern Pinwheel Galaxy",
    "description": "The Southern Pinwheel Galaxy (NGC 5236 or M83), is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 15 million light-years away \nin the constellation borders of Hydra and Centaurus. \nNicolas-Louis de Lacaille discovered M83 on 23 February 1752 at the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nM83 is a massive, grand design spiral galaxy. The peculiar dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 lies near M83,\nand the two likely interacted within the last billion years resulting in starburst activity in their central regions.\n\nThe star formation rate in M83 is higher along the leading edge of the spiral arms, as predicted by density wave theory. \nNASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer project on 16 April 2008 reported finding large numbers of new stars \nin the outer reaches of the galaxyâ€”20 kpc from the center.\n\n\nData:\n\nTelescope: Planewave CDK24\n\nCamera: FLI ProLine PL9000\n\nTotal Exposure Time: 15 hours and 50 minutes\n\n\nCredits: Moreno Mantilli / Telescope Live",
