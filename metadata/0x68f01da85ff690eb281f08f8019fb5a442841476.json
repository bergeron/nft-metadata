    "description": "I remember we were in Reykjavik when we saw the clouds disappearing slowly. After a short talk, we took the road to this amazing waterfall, which I knew was perfect for sunset pictures.\n\nThe road of the south that led us there is a straight line that we followed for hours. The wild ocean on our right, the steep mountains on our left. The wind coming from the ocean was strong and was pushing the car very often. The sun was going down under the thick layer of clouds, bathing all the land in a warm golden light.\n\nFinally, we arrived at the parking lot. Many people were there and it was late, so late that I didn't even take the time to wear my coat and ran straight to the waterfall. The powerful fall got me wet well before I arrived at the spot. I climbed the stairs 2 by 2, so impatient to make my picture. Finally, I set up the gear, the light was strong, I clicked. It was in the box.\n\nCountry: Iceland\nDate: 10/10/2021\nArtist: Joffrey Briaud\nSize: 4129 × 6196\nLicense: Unlimited Commercial",
