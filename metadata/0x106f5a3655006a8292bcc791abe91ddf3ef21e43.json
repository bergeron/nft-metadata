    "description": "The world was becoming beautiful If We were kind We loved nature. And We heard the sound of horses. Running in the rain The world is not beautiful We made it ugly Because we only saw ourselves. We did not even see others. The sun is shining forever. And we do not enjoy. From nothing. Not of life. Not together. Not alone The sky wanted to cry. On the grave of man On the corpse of art The time has come. We are done. We consumed it ourselves. We consumed the world. Art is dead We laughed together To dance the leaves in the wind. When the hands of the clock stop. Nature laughs at us.You have to go slowly Like a snail And you have to be patient Like a spider.",
