    "description": "At first it seemed a little scary and dangerous, and how wrong we were. It was a contact with something primal inside, a little wild, but free and beautiful. The wind and the hills all around, and it seemed like you could ride a horse far and away forever.  The air is overflowing with the scent of the meadows, the horse is strong and incredibly beautiful, he feels your gaze and strength. And you are in a state of bliss.\n",
