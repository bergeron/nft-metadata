    "description": "The beginning of my pointillism journey. \n\nThis was my first EVER pointillism piece, completed well over 15 years ago.  \n\nA young child holding a flashlight up to their face, more than likely telling a spooky ghost story.  Drawn with only the primary colors, Red, Yellow, and Blue.  This piece marks the moment that my passion for pointillism art began.\n\nIt's only fitting that it becomes token #1 in this collection.\n\nPure Joy. ",
