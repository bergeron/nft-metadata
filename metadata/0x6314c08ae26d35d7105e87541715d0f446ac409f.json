    "description": "Upon a mountain's crest she stood  \nHer hair in wild disarray  \nAs pieces of her blew away  \nInto the dust of yesterday\n\nBut still she stood, unbroken, strong  \nHer eyes upon the distant sky  \nA fierce determination in her song  \nAs she refused to let her spirit die\n\nFor though the winds of fate may blow  \nAnd strip her of her all  \nShe'll find the strength to let it go  \nAnd rise again, after the fall\n\nAnd so she'll stand, upon that peak  \nA beacon in the dark  \nA symbol of the strength we seek  \nWhen life tears us apart.\n\n_____\n\nThis is a photographic artwork with a real human, who was lit, posed and photographed in studio. Ai was used to create the backdrop and composited into the portrait.\n\nAbout the artist:\n\nVictoria West is an activist, story teller and a Master of Photographic Arts, who's work is inspired by what she cares most deeply about. With a painterly style, her photographic composites are entirely lit, composed, shot and edited by Victoria. Her attention to detail and craft has won her many awards. She has been a member of Team Canada in the World Photographic Cup 2019, 2020, 2021, & 2022, and brought home a bronze medal in 2019.  Sheâ€™s also made history by being awarded the title of Portrait Photographer of the Year, 2019, 2020 & 2021, by the Professional Photographers of Canada.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use for private print display and in virtual galleries. \nProvides no rights for commercial use, merchandise, distribution, or derivative works.
