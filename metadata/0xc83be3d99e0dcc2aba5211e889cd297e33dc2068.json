    "description": "A derivative of Bored Ape Yacht Club Token #1980. \n\nJessica is a partner at GoldApe Snacks on Ape Street. She started her career in the 1980s at a time when female bankers were in the minority of finance professionals. Jessica has always done it her way, and focused on finding value where others were not looking. After a lucrative investment banking career, Jessica was able to retire and join the Yacht Club where she is commonly seen on her 75-foot yacht Diamond Hands.\n\nOne of the young girls that Jessica mentors is in the girl scouts. Her troop is selling cookies, and also has the option to give back to a local veteran's charity. Jessica is lending her likeness to this derivative in an effort to raise funds for this cause.",
