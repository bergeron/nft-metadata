    "description": "Throughout our lives we are forced to make a certain choice, it permeates our existence, because we are preconditioned to categorise everything on black and white, good and bad, beautiful and ugly. Such categories greatly limit our perception of reality. \n\nDespite our tendency to embrace discrete evaluation, life isnâ€™t a fight between two extremes, which it seems to be. \n\nInstead, it appears as a subtle and fragile balance between elements, existing in everlasting symbiosis with each other. \n\nThe material chosen for the visualisation of a futuristic hero appears as an organic glass, ephemeral and fragile garment, just like our own idea of reality, representing the concept of eternal balance. Its transparency depicts the purity of a hero and reflections appear as a soul mirror. The hero finds himself in both light and dark, depending on the light scene. Optical diffractions and contrasting backgrounds serve as transitional stages in attempts to grasp the essence of reality.",
