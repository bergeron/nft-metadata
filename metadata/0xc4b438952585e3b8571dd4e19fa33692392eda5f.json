    "description": "In the first place it’s pretty clear that we interact with an organizational matrix, a kind of informational field,\nWhich contains all of the information within each of its portions,  it’s a holographic type organizational matrix. \nBut there is no quality of experience at that level, objects are not separated they exist \nin an extraordinary complex reality beyond our understanding\n\nPiece inspired in the work of genious Dalí surrealism and the extraordinary mind of Jacobo Grinberg ",
