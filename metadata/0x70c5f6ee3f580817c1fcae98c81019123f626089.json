    "description": "Before we can rise, we must realise that we are worth a life full of love, peace and joy. As we start to rise above the trauma, the river becomes less narrow - making a way for us to live the life we desire.\n\nNaurita Briscoe and her daughters, Niesha, Kashana, Siannah, Kiara, and Shennaye collaborated to produce this work. \n\nNaurita and her daughters are Kuku Yalanji artists from the Mossman and Daintree regions of Far North Queensland in Australia.
