    "description": "The Tesseract is a core formula of the algorithm discovered by Lewis Carroll that Yetiz use to fold space and travel between dimensions. The lore is when Carroll discovered the Tesseract he opened a wormhole in the Hellfire caves of Oxford finding the Yeti galaxy, who he entrusted to protect the sacred algorithm from falling into the hands of humankind. Once Carroll returned to Earth he published a series of books and poems, considered literary nonsense, that depicted experiences from the Tesseract. If you own this NFT your Yeti will be threaded to every story from YetiLabz on the blockchain. Upon the release of Level 1, the Yeti who holds a Tesseract will be a keystone to folding space for other Yetiz. Its algorithm can be shared or traded as an NFT to another Yeti for their cave travels without being burned in the next level evolution. This is an item of extreme utility, desired by many.",
