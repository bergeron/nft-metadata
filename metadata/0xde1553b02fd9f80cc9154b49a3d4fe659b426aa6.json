    "description": "Evermore is one of my songs that I wrote in one sitting, and is for sure one of the most vulnerable songs I've written to this day. The music video shot followed the same spirit; at an abandoned dance studio where I expressed myself without a plan. The gif is some moments from that day. \nThis collaboration event is a perfect opportunity for me to share this with you. There isn't lots of rock music in Web3 and Pete and I would love to use your support to be able to finish this song and share some more of what we got <3",
