    "description": "Raven is a powerful figure who transforms the world from loss, to prophecy, to insight. Raven connects the material world with the world of spirits beyond. Raven is a collection of original, generative, poetry, music and art. \n\nThe music and poetry were composed by Emil, recorded at Salt Spring Studios and performed by Emil G Music.\n\nStable Diffusion, trained by SpaDogs, was used locally in the studio, to create the art for this project.  \n\nThe end result, ethically produced, original poetry, music and art.\n\nSide note: Vinyl records were played in the studio while the neural network did its thing.  \n\nWhat’s not to love?\n\nQuadraphonic is encoded using Involve Encode™ Surround Stereo down-mix & universal stereo audio format.",
