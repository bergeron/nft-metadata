    "description": "There is something that is impossible to do all the time, even if it is something beautiful - like hugs and kisses, like the feeling of the breath of a loved one on your collarbones - it is yours, truly intimate, and not yours at the same time\n \nThere are feelings that flare up instantly and disappear when the right moment is missed. So fast that you can't blink. Becoming easily accessible, many things can lose their meaning. And there are feelings that carry through life, no matter how quickly they were born\n \nThere is something that needs to be taken care of. Maximum care. Precise caution, but not weakness. There is something that cannot be held, and is very easy to frighten off.\n \nAnd then there is something for which none of us suddenly has names, templates, frames, or suitable recipes. I think itâ€™s called Life",
