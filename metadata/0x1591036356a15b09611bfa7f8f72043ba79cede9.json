    "description": "I was stepping onto a plane, heading south to see her and capture Autumn\nwhen I got the news.  \nMy beautiful photographer friend had died.  \nAlthough I got the camera out a couple of times my heart just wasn’t in it.  \nIt wasn’t until I put the drone up here that I could let the tears fall.  \nThere was something freeing about soaring high above the earth.  \n\n\nI cried for the battle that was so bravely fought, but couldn’t be won.  \nI cried for the total waste of it all.  \nI cried for all the tomorrows, that will never come.  \n\n\nIn memory of Victoria Bowman  \n\n\n“The perfect light in an extra special sunrise.  \nThe most vivid color in a heart-stopping sunset.  \nAnd the brightest sunshine in a cloudless day”  ",
