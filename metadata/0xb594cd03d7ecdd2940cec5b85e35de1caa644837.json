    "description": "'Golden Soul'\n\n48\" x 30\"\n\nSculpture on canvas - Kintsugi Series  \nInsulation material, dense foam, acrylic, and resin on stretched canvas\n\nKintsugi is the Japanese/Chinese art philosophy of mending broken pottery with gold. The broken pottery ends up stronger and more unique due to the sophisticated handcrafted mending process.\n\nPolen applies Kintsugi to human beings. We all break, yet we are free to re-create and heal ourselves unapologetically in any color or form. Imperfections are to be embraced.\n\nGolden Soul is a broken soul turned into pure gold. She went through her metamorphosis in her own ways. Maybe you are too all your broken parts mended together and shining as a whole. \n\nThis NFT is paired with the physical work of art by the artist Polen Cerci in Miami 2022/2023\n\nThe buyer of this NFT can redeem the physical work on https://artfora.com",
