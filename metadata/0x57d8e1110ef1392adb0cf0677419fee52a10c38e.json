    "description": "Upside down. It was what she was used to. She no longer remembered the world, that world. When everything was different. And had it ever been.\n\nHer grandmother spoke of the days before the end of the Earth. Before everyone had to leave home and hastily load onto ships.\nToday is day 178, the day of her birth. \nNo one here counts months, it's useless.\n\nExactly one time a year you can see the sun, but for 34 min. The asteroid that obscures it shifts only a few degrees. She was born at this \"sunrise.\" Perhaps it is the best gift she has ever received in her life.  \n\nOn this planet, the sun only illuminates one part of it. It's always just one part. The planet revolves after the luminary and doesn't give a chance for day and night to change. Eternal twilight. And the Sun is habitually called a completely different star.\n\nThere beyond the horizon is the world she dreams of. Here underground is her reality. Entire cities. People never come to the surface. Today she's up. \nHer name's Miracle.",
