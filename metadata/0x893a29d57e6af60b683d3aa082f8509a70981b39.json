    "name": "Outré Victrola - Domesticated Goddess",
    "description": "Outré Victrola is a 4590 x 4590 PNG File that portrays the Domesticated Goddess Dancing in the forgotten spaces of the past.\n\nIts quality is such that you can get a good look at the Goddess and her various adornments.\n\nIt has a washed out hue which takes into consideration both the full color and black and white moments in the video of the same name.\n\nStory:\n\nThe Domesticated Goddess had many names in the \"before\", all blissfully forgotten during the process in my work lab. I began to restring her wires and she was clear in her desire to be free from the demands of her station, to be one with the wide open sky. Now the birds are her companions aiding in her movement, through time and space where only the wild creatures know her now. \n",
