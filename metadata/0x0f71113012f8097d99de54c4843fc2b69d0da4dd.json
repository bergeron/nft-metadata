    "description": "“Tell me about your city; Where I live, the city is covered in colours, so colourful it’s lurid. Such a wild place to be young, it's full of young people. \nYou can easily get a job or make money just as easily as you could get swindled or scammed. It's populated by a lot of high income class citizens but full of lower income class citizens, it's relatively peaceful but noisy and rough at the same time. The city is so colourful it almost hurts to look at it, especially when it's closing hours and the roads are covered in vehicles and drowned in headlights, almost painted red with backlights. \nYou see people zooming off on motorcycles to beat the traffic. The roads are so dangerous that sometimes I forget myself and enjoy the speed and the air blowing on my face. Other Times I vehemently warn the rider to slow down. \nSo, what is your city like?” \n\nwork is currently on view for the next month in GAZELL.iO's project space in London.\n\nVerisart certified: https://verisart.com/works/adesola-yusuf-e1a434af-3fb6-4d20-9f53-987b27494dfc\n",
