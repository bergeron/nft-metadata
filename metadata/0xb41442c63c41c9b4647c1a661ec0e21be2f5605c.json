    "description": "I wanted to explore object materiality to see how moving from one to another could create in between states to create a hybrid new material. I was curious if I could treat objects much like paint on a pallette. As a jumping off point, I used Disco Diffusion that leverages an AI Image generation. I guided the AI to create a sequence of bouquets made out of motorcycle parts.  I then interpolated those frames together and used that to render a 3D video to give the image physical qualities. ",
