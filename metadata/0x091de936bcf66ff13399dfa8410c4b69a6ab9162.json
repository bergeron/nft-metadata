    "description": "Heist came into existence because of the need for more 150 BPM tracks in my DJ sets. I often play around with forward pushing tracks blended with halftime downbeat ones when I'm DJing and with that in mind, I started messing around with this bass sound I'd learnt how to make from a Stranjah tutorial and ended up making this whole track around it. \n\nI started my web3 journey through Catalog, minted my genesis in July 2021 and it's been quite the journey ever since, I feel fortunate to have collectors and to have collected a bunch of music myself. I've always been keen to drop on this lovely platform and when Sound got in touch it felt right to put this club-friendly banger out.",
