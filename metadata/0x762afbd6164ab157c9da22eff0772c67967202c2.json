    "description": "Sitting under the stars has been an infatuation of mankind since the beginning of time. The stars were the basis of stories in ancient cultures and have captivated many people even today.\n\nHiking into the vast dunes at night would be a daunting task without scouting ahead during the daytime. Shots like this aren't possible with mere luck. I recorded my previous hikes and marked locations for possible locations and decided to shoot this ridge near the Alkali Flats trail. Winds were whipping at near 40 mph and reset the foot prints that can disturb a beautiful dune scene.\n\nThis shot was 21 images combined for the night sky and one image taken at blue hour from the exact same spot. I planted my camera on this ridge at 3:30am and didn't move until 6am to complete the vision of this shot.\n\nThe stars over the gypsum of White Sands aren't easily accessible due to the neighboring missile testing site but it is possible thanks to permits. The extra effort pays off in White Sands Galactic Park.",
