    "description": "Float embodies an adventurous spirit, appreciation of the earth and the world without limitations.\n\nInspired by my connection with nature. The idea came from a very old drawing I made for myself when I started surfing and fell in love with the ocean. Years later, after more experience as an artist, I still love the emotions and the memories it brings back so I decided to recreate this piece and bring it to life.\n\nYear created 2022\nMint 2022\nAnimation by Thawatchai Chunhachai\nMusic By Artificial.Music",
