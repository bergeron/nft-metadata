    "description": "Sky Fire is a 1/1 endless loop of serenity. \n\nAs I carefully laid flat on the ground, to keep my eye line with that of the camera, I guided my drone through this small gap to reveal one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever witnessed. \n\nIn life, we often find ourselves stuck in the shadows.

Let this video take you on a visual journey out of the shadows to a state of reverie.\n\n4k H.264\n35°17'14\" S 149°5'39\" E\n",
