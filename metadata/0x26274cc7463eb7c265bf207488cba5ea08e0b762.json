    "description": "I can't feel anything. Hold on. Wait! I need to hear. Quiet, please. Who's there?\nIt's so wet. The walls are damp, slippery, and cold. I feel like I'm standing up to my ankles in water. I'm not alone in here. Someone's crying... Or laughing? This is very strange, I don't understand. For some reason I can't speak, my voice is gone. I try to take a deep breath, but it's painful. It's very dark, I can't see anything. Only sounds. Splashes of water and sounds of someone's hysteria. I can't even speak or call for help. It's so cold, I can't feel my fingers, I'm shivering all over my body. Why am I naked? I don't remember anything. How on earth did I get here?\nThink, think, think. What was the last thing I remembered?\n\nSuddenly, a light began to appear over my head, and the heavy, stone lid of the well began to move aside. I squinted my eyes from the blinding light and looked around the faintly lit well, trying to see who else was here, but... I found myself alone. How is this possible?\n....",
