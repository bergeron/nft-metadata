    "description": "Honor Award in the World As I See It in Lewisville Texas Oct 29, 2022 at Grand Theater Lewisville. Organized by Lewisville Visual Artist League. \n\nCOVID forced people to start working from home and connect the world using their phone, living our lives and tastes through it. More connected and aware of global issues. More exposed and easily tracked and targeted by companies selling their products and services. An affordable tool to see, discover and learn the beautiful and the ugly things of this world.",
