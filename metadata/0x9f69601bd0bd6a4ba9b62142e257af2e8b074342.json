    "description": "Good and Evil? \nLike a game that is part of life itself, with a decision you advance on the board, you do not know on which side of the scale you are and the butterfly effect becomes latent without us seeing it, with every breath and every breath that comes and goes accompanied by a flicker that, uncertain as fate and accurate as a shooter, puts us in our thread. But there is always something to do... Or not? Just play, now that you know you're on the board.",
