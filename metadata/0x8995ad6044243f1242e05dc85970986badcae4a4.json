    "description": "24\" giclée print signed by Nick Kuder. \nFramed in 0.75\" black maple with a 2\" mat. \n\nNick often switches from rational and systematic to spirited and intuitive, resulting in work that is equal parts Apollonian and Dionysian.\n\nSchematic is a highly formalistic work based on mathematical and consequential systems, utilizing such elements to build an aesthetic framework that generates thought provoking and playful artistic production.\n\nOffering an investigation into the possibilities of forms using a restrained and elegant language, Schematic is arranged in a predetermined mathematical sequence, yet the rhythmic progression through the forms via experience reveals an innate and intimate artistic gesture.\n\nSchematic was acquired by the Hashes DAO for its permanent collection in November 2021 from the Sotheby’s Contemporary Curated series featured alongside works from Andy Warhol, Kaws, Banksy, and Marina Abramovich.",
