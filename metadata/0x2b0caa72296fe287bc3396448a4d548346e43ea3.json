    "description": "This AI-generated artwork tries to capture the essence of a bright day at the river while still being a high fashion photo. I have been pushing realism with AI since I started, combining multiple tools, and I like to explore fashion and build an ambiance with a nice portrait. \n\nIt has no-gender clothes that challenges beauty standards and bring a soft touch to the model who appears half-uncovered at the torso. Plus, the high fashion top which looks like a window is increasing the idea of having to open himself, and discovering his true self, his true nature, and embrace his own fragility / masculinity, while surrounded by nature. \n\nHow is it made : Midjourney / Stable diffusion / Photoshop edits\nEdition: 1/1 \nYear: 2023\nCreator: Grambert Matthieu\nDimensions (in pixels): 1440 x 1800\n\n",
