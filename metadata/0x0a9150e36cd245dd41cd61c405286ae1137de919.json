    "description": "One morning I checked my weather app and it told me that it was a foggy morning. A quick glance out of the window confirmed this.\nIt's kind of a disease but when I see fog I automaticly grab my camera and hit the streets.\nOn this special day I took my flying camera for a walk and together we discovered what's happening above these clouds. And now I can tell you it's magic!\n\nThe Cologne Cathedral was built in 1248 but no one else has ever shot a picture like this!\nThe uniqueness is the reason I offer it to the NFT community",
