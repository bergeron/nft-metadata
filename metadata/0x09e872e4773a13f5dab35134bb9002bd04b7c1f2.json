    "description": "I have taken the stylus in my hands many times, but it is difficult for me to collect my thoughts in order.\nHard.\nI painted this picture all these days, on the 14th day of the war, I finished.\nHere are all my emotions for these terrible 14 days.\nThis picture means a lot to me, here is all my pain and faith in victory.\nI will remember this day forever.\nThe scariest day.\nThe beginning of the war.\nFebruary 24, 07:20\nCall from mom:\nDaughter, do not worry, the war has begun, they are shooting ...\nAfter these words, I understood that trouble had come, I understood that I needed to do something, run somewhere, make decisions.\nAnd now the first siren... What to do?  I replayed this situation in my head many times, it seemed to me that I knew the algorithm of actions.\nBut, at the sound of a siren, I was confused.\nI had a heavy bag, backpack, 2 cats and a dog.  I was holding my five year old son by the hand.  We ran from the top floor down, the elevator is off.....  \n\nI pray for peace.",
