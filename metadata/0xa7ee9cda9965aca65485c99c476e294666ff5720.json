    "description": "Did you know that every petal, like a fingerprint, is different and unique? This artwork stems from vivid emotion. The petals themselves are lonely, but they are unique. Every petal is floating in the air. When I created this work, I wanted to make the viewer feel like they were watching a flying petal, supported by an invisible structure.",
