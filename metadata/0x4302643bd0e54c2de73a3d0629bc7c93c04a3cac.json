    "description": "Diptych refers to the period when Leonora Carrington collaborated and worked together with Max Ernst. The artists supported each other and made sculptures of guardian animals to decorate their house. Ernst created his birds and Carrington created a plaster horse head.\nThese kind animals can become your lucky charms.\n\nXenoCat June is a multidisciplinary artist. In her nft practice she explores the possibilities of the intersection of images and contexts taken from classical art and painting with mass-cultural phenomena and technological perspectives.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus.",
