    "description": "In the beginning there was only darkness. But out of the emptiness arose a spark, a glimmer of light that flickered and danced, illuminating the darkness with its radiance. And the light emanated a warmth and energy that pulsed through the darkness.\n\nThe light began to move, its movements fluid and graceful, its shape growing and expanding as it created the universe around it. It spun the galaxies into existence, formed stars from stardust and painted the cosmos in shades of gold.\n\nAs it worked, the light grew stronger, brightening and radiating at every moment. And in the midst of that glowing light, a new form began to take shape: the form of a man, standing tall and proud, his body filled with the same energy as the light that had given him life.\n\nAnd thus was born the universe, formed by the Glow of Creation.",
