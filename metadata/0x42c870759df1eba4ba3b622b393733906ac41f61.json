This piece captualtes our vibes, dreams, and everything in between. The piece was brought to life by the talented @Army_Artwork, who recently went through a tragic web3 incident and lost all of their web3 savings. The SBBbrotherhood commissioners unanimously agreed to donate 100% of the funds of the mint to Army_Artwork hoping that they will at least recover some of the losses and continue to bring beautiful art. \n\nThanks to all for taking the time to mint this piece.  \nLong live the SBBrotherhood.\n\nCommissioners:  \n0xExodia  \nChun0069  \nAdinalini  \n0x8andy  \nMisterWrister  \ndgtl#1986  \nTotsNFTs  \n0xElectrico  \nNFTHugh  \nslowerpie  \nDanteoo0  \nnfty00  \nillumanbeing  \nhuntclubhero  \nmcheng40  \n0xeddy  \nblvckstar  \nShikamaru  \nKUANG_NFT  \nVoncrossfit\n\nNo utility, just vibes",
