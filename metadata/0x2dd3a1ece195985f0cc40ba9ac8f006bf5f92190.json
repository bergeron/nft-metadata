    "description": "Once again you will be blown away by the social irony distinguishing MYFOâ€™s artworks. Micky Dollar is a cheerful but thoughtful artwork celebrating the show business in its true essence. All the common imagery linked to the sense of appearance and possession, as well as to the exploitation of the image and the ostentation of wealth is contained in this NFT where irony plays with seduction, and the adult relates to the child. The most famous character in the world of comics will lead you to this histrionic representation of opulence bordering on lust. ",
