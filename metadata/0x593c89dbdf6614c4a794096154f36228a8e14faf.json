    "description": "Blind faith by Regina Kim\n\nAmong the overflowing information, there are cases in which the human brain is dominated by one-way, not interactive, information transmission. This is called blind faith, and filters information from media, social networks, and Internet communities, such as those who are addicted to pseudo-religions. \"Blind faith is a terrible belief that traps the ego, blinds oneself, and cuts off communication with others. In order not to be dominated by others and misinformation, you must have an unshakable and correct standard of self.\n\nAbout Artist\n\nHer topic is 'Beyond borders'. Working on collage, Regina Kim wants to create an intense surreal world by overlapping, rearranging, and removing borders between images. Also, she is expanding her world of art by visualizing the various emotions she encounters through life, her thoughts on human rights, minorities, the environment, peace, etc. Regina Kim's orientation is to stand on the borderline and observe various worlds with a wide spectrum. As an artist, it's about creating a world without borders.\n\nInstagram: @regina.graphic\nTwitter: @reginagraphic",
