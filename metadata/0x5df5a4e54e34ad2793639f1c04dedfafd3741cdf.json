    "description": "I travel the sky. Even I, who love my tainted homeland, have finally decided to travel the galaxy.\nThe universe is bigger than I thought, and I am not sure I will find my next home in the time I have left to live.\nI'm just amazed that there are so many civilizations that are more developed than my home.\nLong, long in the future, I will use my life to travel the universe to find a home where my descendants can live in peace.\nUntil that time comes, we will continue to communicate with each other forever. Where shall I go next?\n",
