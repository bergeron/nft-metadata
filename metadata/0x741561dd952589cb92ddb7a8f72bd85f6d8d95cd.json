    "description": "Snakes hold a spiritual omen, meaning rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing. Transforming not from one surface identity to another, but to let your spirit arise and realize that you are truly immortal beyond the mind and body. The rebirth this talks about is not one of being born again, instead meaning to realize your true state of being in this life, while you are still alive.",
