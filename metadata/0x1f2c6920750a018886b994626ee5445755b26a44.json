    "description": "Antarctica is full of incredible beauty and painted in different shades of whites and blues. Huge icebergs, fjords, mountains, ice caps and of course untouched wild nature with hundreds of penguins awaiting you on shore. You have to cross “Drake’s Passage”, one of the roughest seas on Earth, if you want to get there. But when you see the first icebergs and you realize that you have arrived, all your struggles are forgotten. Antarctica is like a different world, unlike anything you have ever seen before.",
