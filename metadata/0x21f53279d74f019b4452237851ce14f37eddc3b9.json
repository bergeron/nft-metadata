    "description": "The Park is a group of friends, musicians, artists, producers, collaborators, instigators, and dance floor starters from the country of California.\n\nHere to speak artist to artist and help revalue music together. \n\nChange takes time, The Park is here for you, URL in the discords, IRL on the road from Madison Square garden to that seedy dive bar, in the coffee shop, talking to friends, doing work together on the daily. \n\nTalking about change, Tess Henley shares: “Rainwater is about regeneration and renewing one’s self through life’s challenges. Everyone goes through change. For an artist or creative, regeneration almost seems to be in the DNA. It’s exciting that this song is part of a community of people who are thinking about this need and putting it into action.” Web3 + Music NFT’s are that action for The Park and fellow artists creating new realities together on chain. We thank you for listening\n\nJosh Lippi - Bass, guitar \nBen Schwier - keys, piano, synths\nTess Henley- Vocals, Keys, programming \nDerek Taylor - drums, percussion, organelle \nTim Anderson - guitar, Juno 6, mix, master, vocoder \n\nRAINWATER\nI am green \nI am a fragile being\nI am grown in grace \nBare the scars on my face \n\nWho you wish to see\nWont always be\nWhat makes me \nUnapologetically free \n\nAnyone to be\nBut I need you more\n\nTake a minute to see\nWhat I love you for \n\nThey call her \nRainwater\nThey call her\nRainwater\nWashed over and over anew\nIn everything true\nThey call her \nRainwater\nThey call her\nRainwater\nWashed over and over anew\nIn everything true\nRainwater \nRainwater\nWashed over and over anew\nIn everything true",
