    "description": "At first glance, you might think that the people in this painting are just a bunch of strangers who have come together to take part in some sort of festival. The way they stand shoulder to shoulder, as if they're all part of one larger unit, hints at something more important than just a gathering.\n\nThe people in this painting have come together to leave home and live as strangers, one of the most difficult things to do. You need courage and strength and the ability to live without your family. And yet many people have done it before us!\n\nDespite the persecution, my people still journey across oceans in search of liberty, justice, and greener pastures.",
