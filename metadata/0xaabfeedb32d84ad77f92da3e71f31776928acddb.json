    "description": "This one's for those who struggle to find a reason to smile.  For those who suffer in silence, never able to reveal their true authentic selves to the world.  For those who grieve the loss of pets and loved ones and yet wake to a new day hoping for lasting love.  This one's for those who feel lost and inexorably glued to anxiety and fear.  Take a breath, step outside, and try to smile.  You are not forgotten.  You are not alone.  We're bonded together in the cosmos.  I'm sending a smile to you."
