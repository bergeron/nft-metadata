Since my very first days in Crypto Art you have encouraged my experimentation and supported my creative expression where ever it may go.  For that belief in my 'heart work' and my vision I am eternally grateful.\n\nI hope you will accept this small token of my appreciation for all that you have done to speed me on on my journey thus far.\nThank you\nV",
