    "description": "“Histories of Rooftops” — 4k (3840 x 2160) | 2m 52s. Ai neural style transfer treatment of drone footage of Union Square Park in New York taken by Mohler in 2021. Originally exhibited at \"Unsolicited Airdrop\" in New York November 3rd-5th, 2021. A continuation of the \"Painted Cities\" series which explores the subconscious of Ai and painted video. The process consists of first going out and filming moments around New York. I look for moments with high levels of motion and architecture. I use neural style transfer with a particular set of rules to apply the water color textures and tone to the base texture of the input video, creating completely new imagery. Harnessing the machine as a tool to imagine.  \nSound by Luke Mombrea",
