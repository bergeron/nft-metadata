    "description": "\"Hunter of the Sky\" is basically based on Noise and GLSL texture operators.\n\nIn this artwork, I imagined an eagle, which saw its prey on a both rainy and sunny day. A rainbow appears in the sky as the eagle is flying. The composition reflects a hunting moment in an abstract way.\n\nIn this project, firstly, I built the chain of operators, and then the artwork created itself generatively. I worked on the details afterwards.\n\nMade with TouchDesigner\n         1920 x 1080\nNehir Ers√º, February 2022",
