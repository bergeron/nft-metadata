    "description": "In the world of the Minerpunk dwarves, there is a precious ore called Dcoff. This ore is composed of Ethereum and serves as the primary source of energy for the Minerpunk dwarf society. The Minerpunk dwarves depend on Dcoff ore for their daily lives, as it provides the energy needed to power their cities and machines, and serves as the foundation of their industry and technology. Whenever a new vein of ore is discovered in the mines, the Minerpunk people gather together to begin the difficult work of mining this valuable resource.",
