    "description": "Sometimes real time is lost or we get lost in it.\nSometimes we are confused who and which one we are. The one who is here or that one in our dreams. We only know that sometimes the \"I\" we dream of is closer to the truth than the \"I\" in reality. \nMaybe it's better to meet ourselves in our dreams.",
