    "description": "Magnum 75 #1 by Werner Bischof. Athens, Greece. 1946\n\nThe Magnum 75 collection is the inaugural NFT collection by Magnum Photos. Created in 2022, the collection brings together works by 76 photographers taken across seven decades. \n\nEach drop will be curated in dialogue with three leading picture editors from across the globe and selected to embody the agency’s past, present, and future. This collection release coincides with the agency’s 75th celebrations and its Annual General Meeting in New York. \n\nThe first collection has been curated by Alejandro Cartagena, co-founder of Obscura.\n\nAlejandro Cartagena said: \"To look into Magnum’s vast archive is to look into the evolving history of photography as a language. For this selection, which marks the first steps of the agency into yet another horizon for photography with the emergence of blockchain technology, I decided to focus on the ingredients that make certain images stand out from the rest – the elements that all photographers should be aiming for. These 76 images celebrate not only the endurance of Magnum Photos but the quality that has made this longevity possible.\"\n\nEdition: 1 of 1\n\n© Werner Bischof/Magnum Photos 2022 All Rights Reserved \nwww.magnumphotos.com/terms-conditions/",
