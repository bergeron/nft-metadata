    "description": "Wohels is part of a limited 2d looped animation series which is constructed from black lines that form and reform abstract transmuting shapes and figures on a white background. These non-linear narratives aim to access a pre-oral knowledge that meanders in between the conscious and the unconscious mind, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. As far as feminism opens up space for a different kind of knowing, I see this process as feminist. I see femininity as an existential condition rooted in all human beings through which we can access chaotic worlds that escape the order of language.",
