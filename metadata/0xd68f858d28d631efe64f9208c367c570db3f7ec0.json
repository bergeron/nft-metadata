    "description": "This photo is about life of humans and new generations after world war atomic apocalypse. they live underground in the deep and dark tunnels to be far from radiations . I used children in this photo Because they are a metaphor about our  future generations that after this incident They can only look at the outside world through narrow and opaque windows And they  always asks their parents that  What was the world like before atomic apocalypse ? Running in the fresh morning air in the meadow and Sleeping under the blue sky and watching the birds fly towards the golden sunset horizon... These are only  small part of the experiences that we will not be able to touch and feel  again after this incident.",
