    "description": "Amir Karimi for Exquisite Workers\n\n“The ticking cube acts as an alert to show us how much our environment is being destroyed in each second. It is a symbol of purity carrying the idea of simplicity. It is a reminder to all of us so that everywhere we see an environmental issue, that cube will be pictured in our mind encouraging us to make some changes. Every second air pollution level is getting higher due to energy use and production. Every year air pollution is responsible for nearly seven million deaths around the world. Have you ever thought about its serious and devastating effects? Did you know that deforestation, acid rain, the hole in the ozone layer, and climate change are the result of air pollution?!” - by Amir Karimi.\n\nArtwork details: Exquisite Workers x Climate champions Amir Karimi from Iran whose sophisticated dream-like 3D works have been featured at The Wrong Biennale, Spain, DigitalArt4Climate '21, Iconic Mints by WSJ+, and WOW Summit Dubai '22.",
