    "description": "My name is TK, i am singer, songwriter, and producer, based in Los Angeles, CA. I am the founder of an NFT platform titled AfroZero, that highlights black and indigenous people of color in Web3. I'm excited to bring you my genesis music NFT titled \"Heaven On Earth.\"\n\n\"Heaven on Earth\" is a song about the power of your imagination. A story of two friends who escape reality together, and build a blissful world of love and fantasy with a little help from a magic mushroom. A dream sequence takes them on a journey deep within, through moments of self discovery and conversations with their ancestors. Throughout their journey they come to find an understanding and appreciation of the very world they left behind. They realize that this world we live in is a beautiful one, and we must all do our part in preserving it, to experience a true heaven on earth. \n\nPerformed, written, produced, and engineered by TK. \nAdditional Guitars by Aidan Graven. \nBackground Vocals by Refi.\nCover art by Karey.\nGolden Egg cover by TellaMan.",
