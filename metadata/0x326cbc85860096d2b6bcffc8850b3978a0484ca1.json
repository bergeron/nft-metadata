    "description": "Before time, before the first second\nThe universe lay dormant, a vast expanse.\nNo stars twinkled, no planets spun\nNo galaxies formed, life hadn't begun.\n\nBut within this void, a spark of light\nIgnited, a cosmic fire burning bright.\nAnd with this flame, time began to flow\nCreating space, and matter, and all we know.\n\nFrom this primordial fire, so fierce and hot\nCame forth the universe, all that we've got.\nSo let us give thanks for the gift of time,\nFor the past, the present and all that lies ahead in its climb.",
