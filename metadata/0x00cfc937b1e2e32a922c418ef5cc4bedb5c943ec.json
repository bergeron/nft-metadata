    "description": "The Whale perfectly summarizes the entrepreneurial spirit of the Crypto industry. Pioneers, roaming the vast open future like the Whale roams the deep blue; fearless and ready to seize the initiative for growth in those unmarked seas of limitless opportunity. But it is not the Whale's size that defines him, but rather the habitat in which he exists. Whale and the ocean are one. Indivisible and bound to one another since time immemorial.",
