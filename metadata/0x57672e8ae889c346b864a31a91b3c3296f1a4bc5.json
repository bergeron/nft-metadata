    "description": "Thank you for considering purchase of this NFT. \n\nIt was minted on Earth Day: 89% of proceeds will go to ecological charities. (I'm aware of the irony of using the Ethereum blockchain.) \n\nThough conceived and produced by Darren Bader, this video isn't an official Darren Bader [Moses Hosiery] artwork. That really shouldn't matterâ€”content speaks for itself (says Darren Bader); value has all sorts of variations, connotations, fluctuations, etcations (says Darren Bader). And who wants a Darren Bader artwork anyway?\n\n6% of proceeds will go to keep Spring Cleaning and/or Post-Hibernal Journal afloat for at least a few more weeks. www.vrnljrnl.org\n\n5% of proceeds will go to an Ethereum wallet address randomly plucked from Etherscan.",
