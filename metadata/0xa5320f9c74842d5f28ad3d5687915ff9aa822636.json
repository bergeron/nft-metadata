    "description": "The war started on 24th February, somewhere between 5-5:30 am. the first bombing in Kyiv happened at that time, at the Airport. That is when all hell broke loose and the bombings kept happening every other hour. They were informed about the sirens and the bomb shelters and they did everything they could to save their lives at that moment.",
