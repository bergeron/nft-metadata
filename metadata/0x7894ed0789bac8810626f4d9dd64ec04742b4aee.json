    "description": "Chimera is a mutation, its genetics a merging of past and present. \n\nNew creative mediums almost always ingest those that came before. Pictograms and hieroglyphics turned into paintings, which eventually became moving images and photoreal graphics. Spoken words evolved into written text, eventually becoming complex screenplays, computer code, and a world of hyperlinks. Most mediums are not discarded, but combined or extended to incorporate new technology or ideas. \n\nWhen a new medium comes into existence, the capabilities of both the artist and viewer increase. The potential subjects within said medium can grow in complexity as well, some fully dependent on the medium that holds them. Other subjects are timeless, popping in and out of multiple movements and genres throughout history. An example of the latter is still life. From ancient carvings through contemporary art, scenes of commonality, beauty, and metaphor have persisted. Traditionally viewed as a type of technical practice or meditation (the bottom of the “hierarchy of genres”), some examples of still life have gone on to be among the most important works in art history. \n\nChimera is a natural progression of still life. It is an old tradition in the very new medium of on-chain generative art, a movement that will have an enormous presence in the future. Chimera simultaneously reaches into the past while exploiting the capabilities of the present and seeks to represent a unique moment in time, a generation of art in between digital and physical realities, encapsulating where we came from and where we are going. \n\nNOTES:\n\nChimera is graphically intensive. Modern hardware is recommended. Ensure that your browser has hardware acceleration enabled.\n\nThe charitable portion of this release will be donated to various cancer research efforts.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n“A”: Toggle animations\n“R”: Toggle autorotation\n“C”: Capture screenshot\n“H”: Capture HD screenshot (CPU intensive) \n\n—\n\nThank you to all that participate in, share, or otherwise support this release. It means more to me than I can say.",
