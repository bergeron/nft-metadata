They double as membership cards into the Degenz DAO, which grants holders a number of different benefits.  Genesis holders get special access to exclusive areas around the Degenz Den metaverse, including Cryptovoxels space, Discord channels, and a Genesis room on the website. Genesis holders also receive free unlockable cryptovoxels wearables, airdrops, are entered into raffles, can periodically claim Honey Tokens, full commercial rights, and are automatically whitelisted into future Degenz Den collections.",
