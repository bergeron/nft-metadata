    "description": "Yakutsk, Russia - 2017\n\n\nEcdemomania : (n.) \n1. A morbid impulse, or obsession, to travel or wander around.\n2. A compulsive wandering away from home.\n\n\nFrantic race against the clock. Hop a train. Fleeting encounter. Next stop. Fugitive friendship. Jump in a bus. One night stand. Ride. Clog the drain of time. Fail. Try again. Walk. Be the stranger again. Follow a path. Get lost. Often. Don’t understand. Don’t try to understand. Lose yourself. Let go. Run away. Search. Run after your shadow. Hang on to it. Let it go.  \n\nBe in motion. Do not stop. Refuse to settle. Do not take root. Only way to fight against the anguish of time passing and its frightening traces. The distance traveled as the only weapon against Chronos. Every kilometer is an illusion of victory.\n",
