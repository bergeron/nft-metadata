    "description": "Inspired by Dutch Golden Age art, I create machine hallucinations by casting neural nets in parallel AI dimensions, creating portraits of entities I conjure up — each with their own life, personality, emotions and sense of purpose.\n\nCreating these portraits, I sense a feeling of loss; of exile, sadness, and a longing for pasts left behind — but I also sense pride, resilience, hope, and new dreams forming in a new land.\n\nTheir lives have become a part of me, and I have become part of them.\n\nTechnique: Generative Adversarial Network AI\nDimensions: 1024 x 1024 px\n",
