    "description": "Blue Sunset is one of our Lost Horizons. It was a serene and tranquil escape in the state of Florida, USA. But now this water has been turned to mud as the land makes way for urban progress. We'll never see this angle of serenity again. This is one of two landscapes within this collection that we have now lost on the edge of time.",
