    "description": "This artwork, generated through 3D software, represents a meticulous experimentation with the bending and deforming of light, the light deformed by a transparent object, and the emotional effects it provides. For this artwork, I reduced objects and volumes to the minimum possible, and let the light to be protagonist. Light is distorted, refracted and bent, and this deformed version of light interacts with the space around- revealing it and some sense also deforming it. \n\n\nNFT resolution: 2000 x 2400 pixeles\nSigned physical print: 100 x 120 cm (39,3 x 47,2 inch).
