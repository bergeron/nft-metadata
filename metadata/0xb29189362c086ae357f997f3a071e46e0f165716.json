    "description": "I remember being in the studio mumbling over this song to come up with the idea. The only actual word that came out was \"California\". After living in LA for a few years I felt like I always wanted to make a song that painted a picture of my new life out here. It took me a while to figure out exactly the concept I wanted to go with but eventually landed on the California girls vibe. I lead with my vulnerable side but as the song progresses I end up letting go of the second guessing and decide to enjoy the moment. I always picture this as the perfect song to take shots at the bar with your friends. ",
