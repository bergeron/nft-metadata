    "description": "What made this person travel a great distance, forgo sleep, undergo long hours of face-painting, and then dance his way to the cemetery in blistering heat?\n\nThe answer is two-fold: pure devotion and a desire for self-realization. And he isn't alone. Every year, tens of thousands of people perform these grandiose rituals. Most people follow a practise known as \"Kaliakam,\" in which they completely transform themselves into their favourite deities by having their faces painted and by dressing in divine costumes. They sometimes express their devotion towards the Supreme Soul by piercing different parts of their bodies with metal spears, knives, and/or hooks. Some devotees even perform animal sacrifices to please their favourite deities.\n\nBy having their faces covered in vibrant colours and by wearing divine outfits, they are actually getting rid of their worldly identity and, consequently, their ego (Ahamkara).\n\nThe Ātman has thus taken the first step towards Nirvana (eternal liberation).",
