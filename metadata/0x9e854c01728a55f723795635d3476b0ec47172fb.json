    "description": "From my solo trip to Croatia, October 2021. \n\nExploring places through my viewfinder allows me to look more openly towards places as sometimes it could be viewed as limiting, however for me it made me feel at peace while being alone in another country. It gave me an extra opportunity to enjoy the quiet, off season, islands in Croatia in a different way and follow up on people's daily lives. \n\nShot on Ilford b/w film.\nMamiya RZ67, 110 mm lens. ",
