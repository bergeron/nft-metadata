    "description": "I envy those with gentle hearts, whose spirits dance like butterflies on life's tapestry, free from doubt and unrest. To them, the world of dreams unfurls as a treasured gift, a captivating sanctuary where every night reveals naught but celestial visions of pure ecstasy, entwined in the tender embrace of an aching soul.\n\n\nArtist: Erik Witsoe\nDigital Image\nOpen Edition \nCopyright remains with the creator.\nLicense and Copyright: Â© Erik Witsoe 2023\n"
