    "description": "My Art is called “Human is NOT available”, this is a reference to the words “the subscriber is not available now, call back later”. When we are soullessly informed by an answering machine on the other end. So the man of the future will no longer be available, figuratively. The theme of a person’s departure from reality is revealed, where robots and artificial intelligence will control everything, people will go to metauniverses, and reality will become a luxury, simple human qualities and ordinary human life will sink into oblivion. The theme of cyberpunk and dystopia slips through.\n\nI portrayed a cyborg, and maybe a robot - a street artist of the future. He soullessly informs us from the future that a human is no longer available.",
