    "description": "We submit to you, \"POWERS,\" the 3rd track off #SEEINGRED. Written and recorded by Billyracxx ft. King Chip. \"POWERS\" is a nocturnal spiritual that evokes feelings of pain and rage channeled toward empowerment.\n\n#SEEINGRED is the new mixtape by cult leader Billyracxx. With #SEEINGRED, the iconoclast artist bred in Eatonville, the first U.S. town founded by emancipated people, delivers another full-length expression of Black American freedom.\n\nThe original #SEEINGRED minting contract excludes the King Chip feature on \"POWERS\". Thus this grant will mark the first ever on-chain mint for Cleveland legend King Chip, who has Kanye cosigns and extensive collabs with Kid Cudi under his belt. As always, Chip brings all killer, no filler to his guest spot.",
