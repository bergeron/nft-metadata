    "description": "I created this in March 2021, during another lockdown and spending my time listening to Americans talk on Clubhouse about Oprah's Interview with Harry & Meghan while at home fires ravaged California, and devastating impacts of the pandemic.  However sometimes we try to escape to those ideas of the American dream, the damsel finding her prince and that it'll all work out if you try enough. Sometimes it's the only thing that gets you through the day. Keep on dreaming for the Good Life ~ this time it might just come to you.\n",
