    "description": "This pretty lady is called the Trinacria, and she is the symbol of Sicily (my favourite part of Italy). If you go there, youâ€™ll probably see it everywhere: in their flags, in tiles, ceramics, decorating walls and pretty much in every souvenir store. She is awesome. Her head is a Gorgoneion, which is basically a winged medusa head, and she has 3 legs arranged in a circular pattern (representing the Triskeles, an ancient Symbol made of 3 spirals connected at the center).\n\nSo as an animator, the question had to be asked: How does she walk? Here's how I imagined it.",
