    "description": "**I would gladly go down in flames, if that's what it takes to remember my name.**  \n  \n**But what I can't stand is this crumbling despair, this slow decay, this burnout.**\n\n---\n\nAs a musician I’ve always tried to make art that’s an honest reflection of where I am in my life at any given moment. And to be honest, the past few months have been one of the most challenging periods of my life.  \n  \nWith my home country of Sri Lanka going through its worse economic crisis in decades it’s been incredibly hard to keep my head above water, let alone create. There have been times when I’ve not even touched my guitar for days on end, which then ends up making me feel even worse. The feeling of burnout has been very, very real.  \n  \nBut as always, and even in these darkest of times, art has been the vine I hold onto to keep myself from sinking. And I’ve been so blessed that art has always found a way to flow through me.  \n     \nThis piece of music and visual art is an exploration of this feeling of burnout that we all struggle with sometimes. And it is a gentle reminder that even in these moments of crumbling despair, there is peace, serenity and strength to be found. I hope this resonates with you.  \n  \n---  \n  \n**Artist:** Lasith Fernando  \n**Collection:**  Editions x Lasith Fernando    \n**Edition:**  1/33 ERC-1155 token  \n  \nAll tokens in this collection are minted on the [Editions x Lasith Fernando](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb7f1ac306f2dbb26152fe512a74b6872a1be262b) custom smart contract.    \n  \nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
