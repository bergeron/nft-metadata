    "description": "I've had a vision for some time,  \nA chromatic scope for arts, entwined  \nBetween lens and pigment, \nWater and mind.\n\nSome paradoxical fission in my imagination,  \nFinally, come to life, \nThrough trial and frustration.  \nInvisible, \nIntangible  \nUntil it clicked. \n\nLike most great discoveries in science,  \nAn accidental reaction. \nWhere they seemingly randomly aligned:  \nWatercolour and photo combined  \nPerfectly. \nJoy and epiphany.\n\nNow I'm running  \nOn some high.  \nTry to catch me.\n\nMedia:  \nDigital photo, captured in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada.  \nAbstract watercolour (physical).\n\nArtist:  \nAlex Mackenzie created all aspects of the final image, including the original photograph and watercolour.",
