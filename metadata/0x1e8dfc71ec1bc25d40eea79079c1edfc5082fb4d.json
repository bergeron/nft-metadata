    "description": "Well, brother, here you go - I minted a “Non Fungible Token” like you asked me to. No, I don’t suddenly feel any different. Don’t think I have any powers activating. Still, this seemed important to you for some reason. I’m glad you have found something you’re so passionate about, though, and wish you all the best. Yes I chose this photo just to create a permanent record of proof on your beloved blockchain that you wore those ridiculous glasses even back then. Love, sis.",
