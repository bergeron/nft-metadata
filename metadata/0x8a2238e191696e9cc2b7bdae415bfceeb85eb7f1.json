    "description": "This music video was shot in a desert in California. Somewhere hours outside of San Diego.\n\n\"Man, this video shoot was so crazy. It looks flashy we got stranded out in the desert for like 5 hours with no water in 102 degree heat, and got rescued by an old white hillbilly with a Trump themed pick up truck. At the end of the day it was fun af and an adventure for sure.\" - Allan Kingdom \n\nAs an independent artist and entrepreneur Allan Kingdom funds all of his own projects from direction, camerawork, marketing, and photography, to recording, mixing, mastering, and engineering. \n\nAll NFT owners will be invited to a private listening party online before project drops. Will also receive tickets to a surprise future event. \n\nDirected by : Kirk Thorn\nFPV Drone : Colin Ringas \n",
