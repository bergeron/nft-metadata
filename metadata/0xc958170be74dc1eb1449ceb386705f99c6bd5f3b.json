    "description": "This book is a love letter to deep tech, a celebration of great leaps of innovation, and a playbook to help ambitious founders succeed in making future-changing deep tech projects. Rana shows us that it is indeed possible to have both crazy ambition and relentless execution. He embraces this contradiction.\n\nMaking Moonshots shows us examples of innovations that promote human flourishing: advancements in longevity and climate science, great works of art. It’s a book about how to build great companies, but it’s also about how to reach our greatest potential as humans. It asks, \"Why should we live in a world of incremental scientific and technological progress when the human race has proven in past eras that we are capable of so much more?\"\n\nThis edition of Making Moonshots is itself Alexandria’s first shot for the moon: an attempt to create a Great Library for the Multiverse, with books that are safe from loss and censorship and a focus on radically positive futures.",
