    "description": "Spirit of Lockett Meadow is a piece based on one of my favorite places in Arizona, Lockett Meadow. I fell in love with many beautiful places in Arizona during my 7 years living there, and Lockett Meadow always stood out to me. The towering aspen trees in the mountains of Flagstaff light up the meadow with their vibrant yellow leaves every Fall. \nI went into the project with no time limit, which was a freeing process considering how fast paced the visual industry can be, and spent several weeks worth of my free time working on the piece.",
