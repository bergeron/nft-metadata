    "name": "The Greek God Dionysus",
    "description": "Dionysus is widely known as the god of wine and grapes, this being true, this is only a small aspect of him. He is the god of the untamed wilderness, irrepressible male procreative energy, intoxication, shamanism, magic, joy, hallucinations, madness, and sexual healing. Traditionally his devotees were Maenads, the woman who led the Rites of Dionysus. From the mythology, it appears he is a symbol of womanâ€™s empowerment, untamed expression, and libations. This is Dionysus.\n\nIlles, Judika. Encyclopedia of Spirits: The Ultimate Guide to the Magic of Saints, Angels, Fairies, Demons, and Ghosts (Witchcraft and Spells). Illustrated, HarperOne, 2009.\n",
