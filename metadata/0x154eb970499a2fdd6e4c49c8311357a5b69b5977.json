    "description": " The rose is a very complex flower symbol. According to legend, this \"queen of flowers\" grew in paradise without thorns, but gained them after the fall of man. The rose has two opposite meanings at the same time. It symbolizes heavenly perfection and earthly passion, time and eternity, life and death, fertility and virginity. In my work, I want to show the rose as a dress given its unique characteristics. ",
