    "description": "Inspired by the Local Natives song of the smae title.\n\nHey now, is it the dawn or the end?\nThe hours we talked\nYou wished we'd stopped\nActing like it's nothing at all\nIn the first act, you'll gun 'em all\nThe kick back in New York\nShoulder was always hard to ignore\nHey!\n\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes\n\nHey now, the slip, the doubt, the itch\nYou bow so long to live beyond\nNow you're walking, humming your song\nMirror in the bathroom, nails getting long\nAw please, tell me I'm wrong\nIn the third act, it's gotta go off\nHey!\n\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes\n\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes\nEven if I'm on your side\nI saw the way you close your eyes",
