    "description": "JGravityy grabs Active Camo and captures the flag to take the win over Reality Check and close the series 2-0 in the first open series at HCS.\n\nJGravity is the Halo Team Captain for BLVKHVND and is dedicated to winning and climbing to the top with his team. He brings nothing but dedication and passion and is hungry for gold.\n\n\nThe very first open series from HCS, JGravityy, and the soon-to-be BLVKHVND Halo Team defeated Reality Check to win the best of three series. This series was hotly contested because of a technical glitch, the CTF Aquarius match-up had to be completed twice, moving into sudden death. After this clip was released to Twitter, the entire HCS community was in an uproar with organizers and the Esports Lead Tashi exclaiming that this video was the “heart” of the Halo competitive scene. If there was anything to define Halo in 2021, it would be “Shut Up, I got camo.”\n",
