    "description": "I rescue homeless cats and dogs in Russia, and I'm scared to imagine what happens to people and animals in Ukraine. I don't support it!\n \nHow many kittens and cats are forever trapped inside the basements of broken houses? How many dogs just don't know where to go, where to hide, where to run, where to find a person, who help? How many wild animals, out of fear, rush deep into the forests, leaving their former habitats?\n\nThat's why 60% of the amount will go to help animals, including animals that are in distress on the territory of Ukraine.",
