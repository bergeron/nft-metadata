    "description": "This sketch was me sitting in the hostel lounge area in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica. I was waiting for my breakfast in the morning looking at this super cool table across from me. I loved this angle, the way the sun was hitting the wood, and the scene of these weird chairs. \n\nTo the right of this page was a few quick lines of surfers at the beach I was trying to remember from the evening before.
