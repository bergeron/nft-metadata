She traveled the world, leaving in her memory all its features and traditions.\nBut the world is changing rapidly and today her soul is drawn to peace and harmony, to nature. She absorbed all the colors, she becomes a part of this world. The more unstable everything that surrounds, the look becomes more confident. In her head is balance and confidence in the future.",
