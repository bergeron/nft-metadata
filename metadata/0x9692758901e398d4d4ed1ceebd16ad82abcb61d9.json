    "description": " “The Theatre” is part of Billy Dinh’s series “The Last Ones” from Chicago, Illinois. USA. It features the Chicago Theatre during the sunset of Winter 2019. \n— The Last Ones is a photography series showcasing the emptiness and scale of normally populated areas across urban parts of the world. Each photo takes advantage of these lonely moments as the individuals wander the deserted almost post-apocalyptic dystopian-like version of each place. There’s a certain eeriness and mystery to each image with how the figures are within their environments. It’s as if they are one of the last ones left. ",
