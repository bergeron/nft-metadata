    "description": "Day 1. \n\nFrom a B兎te of the Old, is a collection influenced by what Web3.0 means for fashion and exploring where my identity fits into this new digital revolution. Each shape and material takes on a story of renewal. This is translated from a play of literal interpretations mixed with what is absorbed from the literal. The collection seeks to convey a fruitful future from what is sprouted from the old.",
