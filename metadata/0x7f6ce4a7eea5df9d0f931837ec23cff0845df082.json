    "description": "A collaboration with a very talented Brazilian artist who worked on video's sound - Lil Terror\n\n\n\"Uncertainty\"\n\nThere is inside your heart\na bitter, brutal death,\na place of deep upset\nwhere the lyre cannot breathe.\n\nOnce a boiling fire,\nnow your blood is frozen.\nAnd your eye has no tear,\nyour heart — no compassion.\n\nAnd when asked: “What occurred,\nwhat does your heart yearn for?”\nHe raises his arms skyward\nyet gives to men no answer.\n\npoem by Galaktion Tabidze who was a major Georgian poet in the early 20th century",
