The project is inspired by \"Kandor\"(1999-2011), a series of representations of Supermanâ€™s fictional birthplace by artist Mike Kelley. In Superman mythology, the city of Kandor is shrunk and bottled by the villain Brainiac and later rescued by Superman. Having been born in the real Kandor but displaced as a baby, Superman nurtures the miniaturised replica of his birthplace, which acts as a metaphor for his lost past. Lost Home Worlds is a series of worlds trapped inside bottles, inside rooms, inside landscapes, inside computer simulations. Each world is a representation of what has been lost and an emblem of grief and memory. Like distant memories, the miniature worlds are inaccessible yet present and unforgettable. \n\nEach piece is a programmatically generated NFT, presented as an interactive website, hosted permanently on arweave.\n\nSound by Elliot Munn.",
