    "name": "Hun the Thief",
    "description": "Hun the Thief was once a happy and carefree child, living in the bustling city of the Order. But when the Order came to power, they destroyed everything Hun held dear. His parents were killed, his home was destroyed, and he was left with nothing but the clothes on his back. He soon learned to survive by stealing whatever he could, and became a master thief. Now, he lurks in the shadows of the city, waiting for his chance to strike back at the Order and take what is rightfully his - the Holy Grail. \n\nDiscover more at https://midanft.com/portraits/ ",
