    "description": "pi(x)el is a project bridging identity, diversity and technology, which will take on different formats across a range of media (performance, interactive sculpture, video art, wearableâ€¦)\n\nwith pi(x)el, filip custic harnesses technology to sculpt a changeable body, unconstrained by the established norm.\n\nan hyperrealist sculpture, immobile in a rectangular pedestal, wears a suit of digital screens. Strategically located over features including the mouth, eyes or genitals, each screen is a treasury of body-part images filmed from a diverse cast of models. With a simple swipe, the viewer can change these images, using the suit to shape a new body which looks beyond gender, age or race.\n\nthis unique NFT is part of the pi(x)el series with a total of 5 pieces.\n\nthe images shown on screen are the result of an exhaustive casting process in which Custic set out to express the human body in all its diversity.\n\neach piece displays a selection of different images on the screens.\n\nmoving away from the idealised bodies of his previous works, pi(x)el embraces wrinkles, spots and scars, focussing on reality to celebrate human uniqueness.\n\na 4K quality video will also be provided.",
