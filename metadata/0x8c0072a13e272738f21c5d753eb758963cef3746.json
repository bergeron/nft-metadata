    "description": "bitMangrove is a series of works by Jeremy McKane. The idea is to turn code into conservation. What would we have done in 1986 when the first macintosh computers changed the world, what if they told us that blue carbon was the secret to our success. The Superweapon for our pending Climate Catastrophe. The thing is, we still have time. Its the vision of the artist to create pieces like this that help become effective science communication tools so that we can do something. Since the inception of the first bitMangrove the artist and his team have helped identify the root cause of several coral diseases with a plan on how to isolate the threats. It is the artists hope that with more of these works we can address these issues before they become catastrophic. ",
