    "description": "Pepe the Frog is not only handsome, but also smart. He can perform a number of tasks that require his attention. For example, no matter what Pepe does, he always looks at one point, which means that he is not distracted by extraneous things. And this is very good, because he can only look at one object. This allows Pepe to focus on one goal. Besides, Pepe is very curious. He is interested in everything that surrounds him.",
