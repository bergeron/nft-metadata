    "description": "WE WEAR THE DARKNESS ON OUR FOREHEADS\n\n...\n\nA dark art project by Hulki Okan Tabak minted on his Manifold deployed ERC 721 smart contract DARKNESS. All artwork is 1/1 under normal darkness conditions. Further loss of light to be avoided. \n\nHarking back to Dylan Thomas, dear friend, collector, artist, viewer; rage rage against the dying of the nuance, of the different, of the special, of the stand out, of the vocal and the quiet, of the human, of the humane.. Rage rage against not the darkness on our foreheads but the darkness concealed that deaths the light of life and hope.\n\n...\n\nAll characters created with the help of AI tools and are fictitious.
