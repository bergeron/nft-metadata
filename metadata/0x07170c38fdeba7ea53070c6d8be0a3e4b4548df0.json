    "description": "// AN ARTIST FINDING A WAY //\n\nLet us pull back the mask and unleash the inferno\n\n[[ 3 BURNS FOR 1 ]]  \n[[ BUT 1 IS BETTER THAN NONE ]]\n\nAs an artist, my inspiration for the collection \"Inferno Unmasked\" comes from the constantly evolving world of digital art and the growing appreciation for unique and experimental forms of it. As a lover of glitch art, I sought to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in this medium, and to create a collection that would challenge and inspire both myself and the viewer.\n\nThis collection is a reflection of my own personal journey of self-discovery, as I strive to grow as an artist and a human being. The imagery, with its static and flashing objects, demonic figures, and the \"burn me\" theme, is a symbol of my willingness to let go of the past and embrace change, in order to reach new heights in my artistic and personal pursuits.\n\nWith \"Inferno Unmasked\", I hope to not only showcase my love for glitch art, but also to spark a conversation about the ever-evolving world of digital art and the role it plays in personal growth and self-discovery.",
