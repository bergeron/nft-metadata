    "description": "“In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness.\n\nAnd God said, \"Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.\" And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close to mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. \"What is the purpose of all this?\" he asked politely.\n\n\"Everything must have a purpose?\" asked God.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said man.\n\n\"Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,\" said God.\n\nAnd He went away.”\n― Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle \n\nThis piece inspired by \"The Creation of Adam\" a fresco painting by Italian artist Michelangelo and this is our version of how the creation of mankind looks like, the creation of us, and Convert.\n\nThis piece is a collaborative work between our studio and Bottle Smoker as the audio artist.
