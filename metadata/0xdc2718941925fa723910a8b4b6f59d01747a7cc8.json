    "description": "“The Great Wave off Kanagawa” is a powerful and iconic woodblock print from Hokusai’s series “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji.” It depicts a towering tsunami wave overshadowing three boats, while Mount Fuji stands in the background. The composition emphasises the insignificance of humans compared to the might of nature. Hokusai’s masterful use of colour, particularly the vibrant indigo of the wave, adds depth and intensity. The intricate details of the waves and the delicate depiction of Mount Fuji showcase Hokusai’s technical skill. This masterpiece captures the harmony and contrasts of the natural world, leaving a lasting impact and becoming a symbol of Japanese art. This is the first ever officially licensed Hokusai Katsushika NFT as a premium digital artwork in 3D by ElmonX. Holders can view and interact with the NFT in Augmented Reality. Edition: 1 of 336",
