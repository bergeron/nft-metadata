    "description": "The source is not always present but our gratitude and understanding of where things flow from creates a source of its own. We seam to always be in a steady flight upwards but it is important to remember those who have been flying with you or pacing the surface still trying to fly themselves. When the wind knocks us back, or we take a wrong turn, those behind you should be viewed as your back stop rather than people you see the need to push out of your way in order to get back on some track of your own. Maybe you were on the right track but needed to regather your strength and steps. Being the veins directly connected to the source now means you are the vessel of energy for your community. It is not lonely at the top once you realize there is no top and attempting to claim the top would simulate trying to connect two positive magnets. No one would swim out to surf if they knew there was only one wave to catch! ",
