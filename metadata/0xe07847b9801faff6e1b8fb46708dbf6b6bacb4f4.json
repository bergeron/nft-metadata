    "description": "The first track from SHLippin's second album \"Several Harsh Lessons.\" SHTraight is the musical representation of lying about your state of intoxication, feelings, and anything that might display some form of vulnerability. The unsteady feeling of each instrument used in the track adds to the idea of a distorted perception, and wobbly demeanor. ",
