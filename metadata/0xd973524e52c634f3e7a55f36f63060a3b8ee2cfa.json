    "description": "Comprised of C.R. Kunfermans initials and the words photo, photography, as well as his full name, and some punctuation symbols - this is the original ASCII mark on the CRKPhoto Contract. The text/character art is based off C.R. Kunferman's Profile Photo/Avatar that he has been using since 2003 on everything from online digital art and photography websites, forums, email lists, social media, and many websites he developed. \nIn October of 2022, this avatar was first scene upon his entrance to the NFT community on twitter. This is the first official token of the C.R. Kunferman Photography Collection, featuring over 25 years of photography, and more until he is no longer able to hold a camera.  \nPortions of NFT sales, royalties, and donations will be gifted to Micheal J. Fox Foundation.",
