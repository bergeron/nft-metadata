    "description": "STRANGE WORLDS  \nFrom The Transparent People series collection  \nWe pass them every day at the central station, in the city squares, and in  \nthe main streets. \nThose streets where, at least for some, it's convenient to collect alms to purchase food products in the best case, and cigarettes, alcohol and maybe drugs, in the worst case.  \nA large part of these people do not want to be transparent. Most of them are looking for a warm corner and help. Others turned the street into a home.  \nWhy do I take pictures of them over and over again?  \nTo raise awareness so the system should do more for them.  \nApparently my eye and heart are attracted to the transparent and want to show everyone that it is there, that it should not be ignored, and that even if it's looks different or strange, it is part of us.\n\nTechnique: Light painting photography, created in real time captured to the camera in one single photographic frame.",
