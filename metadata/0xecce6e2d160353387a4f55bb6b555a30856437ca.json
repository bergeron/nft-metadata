    "description": "1st art piece of collection C0DED1\n\nLife is about understanding Yourself=Universe\nDECODE CODED One speaks for itself.\nDECODE CODED One is about decryption.\n\nColor Hex (hexadecimal) uses combinations all 10 numbers in the decimal system 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and letters A through F. In our experiment we use hexadecimal value as a language.\n\nHuman and machine are equally involved in the creation of each work.\n\nCommunication:\n•\tThe human mind creates a color code that is identical to the content of the art work.\nThe code, which only a machine can perceive.\n•\tIn turn, using this color, the machine visualizes art that is perceptible to humans. \nWatching this art both you and machine think about the same thing (#DEC0DE #C0DED1)\n\nArtwork by Irakli Dolidze.\nPixel Perfect, 2160x2160, PNG.\nidolize, 2022",
