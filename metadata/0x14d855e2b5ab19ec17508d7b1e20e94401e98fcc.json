    "description": "'For Sale' is my Genesis work in The Displaced and Voiceless Series. I was inspired to create this piece and series based on the exodus of field/woodland animals I observed, from a field they previously lived in near my home, due to construction.\n\nThese are some of the most common animals, and due to human nature, precisely because of their perceived lack of rarity, this often results in a perceived lack of value. And so I made him a 1/1!\n\n50% of this sale will be donated to wildlife conservation.  \nCheck out the website at https://displacedandvoiceless.life/",
