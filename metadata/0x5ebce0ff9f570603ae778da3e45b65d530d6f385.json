    "description": "Reproduction makes the original the same, and there can be no reproduction without the original.However, with the advent of virtual images, the apparent hierarchical order of reproduction and original is faded, which Jean-Bodriar calls a simulation with more power than a real object, one step further from the mimesis of imitating and reproducing objects. The world of my work starts from this simulacion, and the virtual image of this work obscures the distinction between the dichotomous real and fake of traditional art. And furthermore, they are creating and visualizing things that do not exist at all.In the era of Simulacion, where metaphysics that distinguishes reality from virtual has disappeared, the virtual image of this work is meaningless to distinguish and draw a line on what is real and virtual, ending the reality and virtualization of this traditional perspective and presenting new possibilities of the virtual world.",
