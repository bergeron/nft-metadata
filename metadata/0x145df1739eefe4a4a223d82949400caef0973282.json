    "name": "Platonic Solids: Hexahedron⁽¹⁾",
    "description": "The Platonic solids are the first series of the Project:Geometron. They are prominent in the philosophy of Plato. He associated each of the four elements –earth, air, water, and fire– with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the Hexahedron⁽¹⁾, Air with the Octahedron⁽²⁾, Water with the Icosahedron⁽³⁾, and Fire with the Tetrahedron⁽⁴⁾. In the fifth Platonic solid, the Dodecahedron⁽⁵⁾, Plato obscurely remarked, “…the god used [it] for arranging the constellations on the whole Heaven“. The Platonic Solids series is limited with only 5 animated NFT artwork.\n\n4000 x 4000 pixels, GIF format available upon request.\n\n[more info](https://geometron.io)",
