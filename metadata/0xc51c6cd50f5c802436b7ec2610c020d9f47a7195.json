    "description": "\"How could I show more clearly how we try to fit into today's society? By adapting a character to her frame. She has to adapt, no matter how.\" \n\n- Tiziano Autera\n\n\nTiziano Autera studies his environment intensively. In this confrontation, he grasps influential perspectives for him, wich he fundamentally and skillfully redesigns.\n\nNew characters he perceives in society flow into his creative process, creating unimagined figurations through shifts in gestures and facial expressions.\n\nThe artist sensually proportions human physiology in such a way that his human images repeatedly reflect their unique countenance.\n\nThrough his cubist approaches female and male body features diffuse to a harmonious existence and lovely commonality.\n\nHis interpretations of human individuality are characterized by colors and patterns wich show our different realities.",
