    "description": "\"Capturing something special, requires patience and catching one's breath at the right moment.\" ~Gustavo\n\nThe photo was taken on 4-22-2017 Earth Day during my first visit to Yosemite National Park.\n\nIt was a four-hour drive one way to get there, I remember leaving home around 8am and arriving around noon. I purposely did not view any books about park, in addition I avoided viewing any books of Ansel Adams before my visit there.\n\nI wanted to perceive the landscapes before me at first sight without any pre-conceived visual prompts from other individuals.\n\nYou are looking at a long exposure created with the use of physical filters, timing, and patience.\n\nThis is a 1/1 digital NFT version.",
