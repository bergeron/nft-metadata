    "description": "Soufside Baby is a ode to the hometown of Crook Brown, the Southside or affectionately the “Soufside” of Atlanta. Particularly the area/city known as College park. It is a soul, funk, and hip-hop fusion over hard knocking drums and a grooving bassline. \n\nCrook takes you down his very own personal memory lane exploring his upbringing in the area. It is an in depth look at family life, street life, and the regular ebbs and flows of a normal life all mixed together. It is essentially a story of what it means to be born and raised on the “Soufside”.\n\nCrooks vocals are like a paint brush with wide gliding strokes on a soulful canvas. You can hear the emotional attachment to the very place he calls home. Despite the areas shortcomings, he still finds peace there, because after all it's still home. Crooks raspy southern drawl adds a flavor to the track that makes it a one of one.  Welcome to the Soufside Baby. \n \n",
