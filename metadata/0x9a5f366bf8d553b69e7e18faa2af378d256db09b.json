    "description": "No, she didn't go to drown in the river, she wants to drown in pleasure, she wants to enjoy herself. Don't block your sexuality, don't forbid yourself to feel, enjoy it, take it, don't let anyone take it away from you. You're beautiful, you're sensual, you should be happy and satisfied. \nBe the Ophelia who did not drown herself, but began to love herself!",
