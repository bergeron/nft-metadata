    "description": "In Maya civilization, there is a fable about a character “Xibalba” who was the ruler of the domain of the underworld . \nThis painting has been inspired from the Maya religious drawings depicting the story of a lover whose loved one dies and the lover, not enduring life without his beloved, prays to Gods to take his life so that he could join his loved one in the other world.\nThe Gods praised his love and his fidelity and ordered Xibalba to bring the man’s loved one back to life.\nXibalba roused the good serpent at the end of his staff to go and bring the woman back to life by kissing the lips of her.",
