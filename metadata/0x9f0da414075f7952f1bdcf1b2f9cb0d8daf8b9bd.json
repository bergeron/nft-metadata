    "description": "KittyKart Roll Kall: reporting in for the GENESIS CLASS of KittyKart. This collection features a standalone kart design that cannot be obtained or recreated via game play. Owning this exclusive kart provides advantages in game and out, and the kart's unique aesthetic makes it a one of a kind collector's item for possession. Minted on December 12th, 2022 as a commemorative piece to celebrate the first on-chain asset integrated into KittyKart, it was distributed free to community members who had been building the project alongside 9VRSE, Inc. since it was launched in October of 2021 (1 year anniversary).",
