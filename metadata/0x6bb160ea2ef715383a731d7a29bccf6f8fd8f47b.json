    "description": "Modern representation of the iconic Bronze of Ife sculpture.. The Ife Head was found by accident in 1938 at the Wunmonije Compound, and the sculpture is said to be a portrait of a ruler known as an Ooni or Oni of Ife in western Nigeria. It was probably made under the patronage of King Obalufon Alayemore whose famous naturalistic life-size face mask in copper shares stylistic features with this work.",
