    "description": "2022 is the Year of The Tiger, according to the Chinese Zodiac.    A month before the Chinese New Year, Pepe cleaned the house to represent ushering in the New Year. \n\nThen, he painted the house and decorated it with red lanterns, door couplets and a peach blossom tree featuring messages of luck and happiness.   \n\nOn the first day of the New Year, his friend Tiger visited Pepe’s house with bringing a small bag of gold coins as a new year gift for him.\n\n They greet \"Gong Hei Fat Choy” to each other, meaning “Wishing you joy, prosperity and getting richer.” \n\nPepe feels so blessed to have Tiger in his life.\n",
