    "description": "A generative artwork that attempts to capture the magic of interplay, the marvel happening when the interaction between simple entities leads to the creation of complex, unpredictable, powerful systems. When the interference between two or more entities results in a new form, new information. \nWhat comes to light is not the simple sum of the elements, but the emergence of a new creature of a higher order of magnitude.\nLike waves meeting, like colors melting, like human beings connecting.\n\nThis artwork is generated by a program written in JavaScript/GLSL - thousands lines of code that condense the artist's thought, with an intentional use of randomness, which makes each piece unique.\n\nEdition 1 of 1\n\nVideo file\nLength: 30 sec\nFrame size: 1200x1200px, \nFrame rate: 30fps\nCodec: H264-MPEG-4 AVC\n\nThe purchase of this NFT gives the right to receive a high resolution copy of the video. (MPEG-4 2000x2000px, 30fps)\n",
