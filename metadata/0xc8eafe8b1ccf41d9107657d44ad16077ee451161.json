    "description": "when i wrote ‘In My Head’, it was a message and reminder to make ur mind a safer place; to not let each and every thought that floods you distract you from your internal & external reality; to focus on who you truly know yourself to be at your core. \n\ni wanted this song and what it means to me to be shared stripped back to its rawest form, to fully convey the message behind it and how it was first written. so this a special acoustic version to do that. <3 \n\nit’s a free gift for the holidays this year and as the first of many drops that will be paying it forward to different causes, secondary proceeds are going to Nvak Foundation’s Artist Care Program to bring resources like mental health care to a musician in need, who will be selected by the golden egg winner.\n\nwithout having access to resources like therapy, i wouldn’t be able to show up as 100% of myself every day in this space and otherwise. i would love nothing more than to provide that to another artist.\n\nenjoyyy!!",
