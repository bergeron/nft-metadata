    "description": "I don't have the craziest emotional story about this photo, but the memory of this day will last forever. Haley is one of my closest friends. I've met her through music, even before I started photography and she's been in my life ever since. We create a-lot together, party together, cry together. Our childhoods were very similar as well and thats why we connect on an emotionally level. \n\nSFSG which means \"So far so good\" from the movie Le Haine. I named this after a phrase that Haley says from the movie. it means going through life, or each day. In the beginning of the movie the man is falling and as he’s falling he continues to say “So far so good” even with knowing his inevitable situation. ",
