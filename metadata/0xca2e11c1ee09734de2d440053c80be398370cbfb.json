    "description": "A beautiful summer evening, the sun setting, I wanted to immortalize this moment. However, a simple photo of a hundredth of a second was not enough for me, I had this need to transcribe the time that passes, this precious time that slips through our fingers. I had the opportunity to meet other photographers during this evening and we were able to talk for long hours. Because photography is that above all, meeting people, speaking around a sunset, talking about the nature that surrounds us and above all enriching our minds with all the wonders that the earth has to offer.",
