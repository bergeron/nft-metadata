    "description": "2000x2000px jpg\ncollage on paper, digitally edited artwork.\n-\nAs an artist, I am committed to exploring my inner self and discovering new ways of retoring identity.\nOne of the methods, I observe and reflect upon my emotions and thoughts through the process of building stones. My work focuses on capturing process and moments, as they emerge, take shape, and eventually fade away. \nI arrange the stones in an asymmetrical or absurd, expressing a more fluid and emotional state. Through this process, I hope to inspire others to explore their own inner selves in new and meaningful ways.",
