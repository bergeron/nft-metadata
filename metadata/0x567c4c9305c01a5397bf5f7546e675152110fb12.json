    "description": "5/5 : Dark Edition\n\n\"Codename: AEROBAT/\" is a collection of 10 HD generative art videos created in Processing.\n\nThis collection is part of a larger concept of mine called \"Immortal Psyche\" which explores the essence of a living being (soul). Each generative video in this collection is given breath by the artist to have reason, character, feeling, consciousness, qualia, memory, perception, thinking, etc.\n\nDepending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal.\n\nThe Processing sketch contains 480 lines of code that generate each unique video. The graphics react to the music which controls the size, alpha, and movement of the visuals. The color palette changes based on the alpha values and a virtual camera rotates around the origin on the x, y, z axes based on probability. \n\nAdditional algorithms such as a Montecarlo Method are used to guide the vectors (location and velocity).",
