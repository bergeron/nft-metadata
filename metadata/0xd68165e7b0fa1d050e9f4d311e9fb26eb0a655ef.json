    "description": "It wasn’t the Disconnected Dionysian Bum lifestyle that had a profound effect on me, it wasn’t Dean Moriarty or the thrill of the prose, it wasn’t even just On the Road. It was the evolution documented in On the Road, Dharma bums and Big Sur. It wasn’t the “Beat King”, beatified and placed on an undesirable pedestal. It was the self-awareness, the ability to observe, observe not only one’s surroundings but oneself and to honestly document it in a truly brilliant fashion that enables you to be right there with him. It was the attention to details, the curiosity, constant battle with oneself, the humanity of it. It was the search for the words, the search for simplicity, it was the honesty with himself and that is vulnerability in its rawest form; honesty with yourself… \nNOTHING BEHIND ME,  \n                EVERYTHING AHEAD OF ME,  \n                                     AS IS EVER SO \n                                                 ON THE ROAD",
