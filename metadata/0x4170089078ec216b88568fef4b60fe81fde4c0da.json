    "description": "If you're familiar with literature, then you may be familiar with the 12 Stages of the Hero's Journey. Step seven of the Hero’s Journey – The Approach to the Inmost Cave – is part of the second act. The approach to the inmost cave section gives the characters (and reader) a chance to reflect on the challenges of the previous section. The journey continues. \n\n\"Regroup\" is the first piece in this collection, inspired by my love of all things sci-fi and step seven of the Hero's Journey. The group is closer to the goal — and to the place or time of ultimate danger. They’re regrouping and gathering their wits as they prepare to face the antagonist or some of the villain’s forces.",
