    "description": "The body is as a symbol of the earthly, natural principle in man.\n\nThe body is a beautiful machine created by nature, as well as a reminder of what an amazing species we are.\n\nThe means of achieving this goal is seen as the harmonious development of the human personality, expressed not only in the improvement of the body, but also in the knowledge of the surrounding world, including through art. And the role of the human body in art is something that seems especially important for such an all-round development.",
