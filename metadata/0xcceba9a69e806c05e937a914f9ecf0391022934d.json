    "description": "Black Gold - I is an original abstract painting on the blockchain.\n\nThis artwork personifies being - a creature of expedience & incandesce. As time passes and we face hard times, our inner light diffuses. Even though we are structurally built to shine eternally in our hearts, at mind we are often in conflict, and it can become challenging to prolong. This painting is a reminder to look within ourselves, listen to our intuition, and go on.  \n\nAbout Balance series - a hybrid of form & intuitive focused expressionism. Detailed shapes at play, each artwork is carefully planned out to form a web of interconnected planes juxtaposing intuitive brush strokes powered by the emotive dance going on in my head.\n\nMeticulously handworked One-of-One NFTs with artist's signature\n\nADDITIONAL DETAILS: NFT: 2048 × 1536 px, PNG (04.30 MB) - 1 of 1 Edition",
