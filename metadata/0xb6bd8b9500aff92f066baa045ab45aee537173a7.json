    "description": "This is a painting by my 5 year old son. He was GRADED on a scale of 4.5 and this received a 3.5. \n\nAs a parent I have NO comprehension of how a teacher could possibly grade a kindergartener on a painting, but here we are. \n\nART IS SUBJECTIVE and should NEVER be graded. We are minting this to show that anyone and everyone can be an artist no matter what. \n\nI set up his own wallet and will give him sole access to the funds when he gets older. ",
