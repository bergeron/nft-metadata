    "description": " He is born from a rock on the summit of Flower Fruit Mountain and goes on to become the king of the monkeys. 300 years later, he learns the way of immortality and various other powerful magical skills from an immortal far away from his home. When he returns, he trains his monkeys into a lethal army, takes a powerful weapon from the Eastern Dragon King by force, and cancels his and all monkeys' names from the Book of Life and Death, releasing them from the endless circle of death and rebirth."
