    "description": "I saw Nikola Tesla in the dark half of the moon and asked him what is the secret of the number 369?  \n He put his hands on my eyes and said softly in my ear:  \nGod created the earth and the sky in 6 days, and a person's heart is broken only 3 times, and it is a lie that they say, luck only comes to you once; Luck comes to you 9 times, and during your life you may not see it or feel it, and you may not live long enough to have it all 9 times.  \nAnd I asked him:  \nWhat is the chance?  \nHe said: It is the power of God (6) that is reflected in you (9).  \n\"And this was my fictional story about 369\"",
