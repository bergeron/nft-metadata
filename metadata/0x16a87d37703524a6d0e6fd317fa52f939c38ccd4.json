    "description": "My friend drove us along a narrow winding road at Point Reyes National Seashore during golden hour. We were on our way to shoot sunset, and as I looked in the side mirror I saw Millie in her usual spot looking out the window. She looked so content, just taking in the sights and smells as we made our way along the coastline. When I look at this photo, I get a sense of calm. I think about how simple a dogs experience is, and the peace they must feel in moments like this. ",
