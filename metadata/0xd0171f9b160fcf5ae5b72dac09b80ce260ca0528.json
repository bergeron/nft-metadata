    "description": "1/1 minted by Hulki Okan Tabak on Dii Inferi smart contract, late 2022\n\nThe dii inferi (Latin, \"the gods below\") were a shadowy collective of ancient Roman deities associated with death and the underworld. Now they will show up in their Manifold deployed Ethereum smart contract, then on other platforms I mint on and perhaps also in a Tezos counterpart smart contract. That is the whole roadmap. There is also no utility other than art, fun, aesthetics, display pleasure, bragging value, talking points and an eventual resale at a later date (hopefully for not all the tokens you hold).",
