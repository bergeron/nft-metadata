    "description": "I photographed the chameleon on the yogi fit female in a studio setting. In post I changed the color of the female body to a monotone, this treatment was selected to accentuate the form and design of both allowing viewer to explore the juxtaposition between reptile and female.  This image has won numerous international accolades including International Photography Awards and exhibited globally.\nThank you for taking the time to view my photography.  Please reach out for further engagement. \n",
