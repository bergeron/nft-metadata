    "description": "RGB is a conceptual artwork speaking about the big fuss around Open Editions. \nArtists and collectors are pretty divided on the subject. Some say that itâ€™s just easy money, while some are in favor of such a project for many reasons. Like they say, your art, your rules.\n\nBy this piece I want to reverse the OE mindset. Collectors can get 1 edition per wallet for free. Then, THEY are in charge of the price and secondary sales. OE can be used to give back to the community and I want to demonstrate it. \n\nWARNING: This video may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.  \n",
