    "description": "6/6 Limited Editions \n\n \nLagoa do Fogo (Fire Lagoon) in São Miguel, Azores is doubtlessly one of the grandest nature attractions of this island, which already is not really poor of beautiful nature sights. This huge blue lake – it is about 2 km long and 1 km wide - fills the ground of an extinct crater, whose caldera was formed during an eruption in 1563. Surrounded by high mountains and luxuriant endemic vegetation, this mystical lake, where an ambiance of divine tranquillity and beauty is reigning, has transparent waters, a peninsula and white sand beaches and is declared nature reserve.",
