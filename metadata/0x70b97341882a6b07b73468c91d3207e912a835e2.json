    "description": "Miniature is a poetic branch of art that has evolved since the 7th century to the present time. Contains 1 or 2 dimensional stylizations. It was used to support the texts of books. That's why their dimensions  were small. Today, it continues to exist as a contemporary art made on plates, with forms and edge contours different from contemporary art, whose expression is given by light and shadow, scanning and stroke and the skies adorned with 22-24 carat gold.",
