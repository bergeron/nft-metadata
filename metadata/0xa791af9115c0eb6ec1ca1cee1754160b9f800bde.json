    "description": "Hidden among the forests, under the majesty of what humans called Mount Aratz, there is a path, very busy for walkers on two and four legs before the great collapse of civilization, by which oaks and ferns accompanied curious eyes to the source of Zirauntza. This source has witnessed the passage of centuries, evolution, catastrophe, death and rebirth, becoming a source of life and creation of new species of living beings, fusion of animals and plants that we once knew, new adaptations to the environment that emerge from the surface of the source of Zirauntza from the very core of the earth.  \nBeings of light and life, the new hope of Mother Earth: the Izaki.\n\nIzaki is a dystopian expressionist artwork with Dada and nature art influence, belonging to Post Human Tales.",
