    "description": "1 of 1. The first single from the forthcoming Sweatson Klank album \"Postcards\". Visuals created by Harris Cole & Sweatson Klank. \nPostcards is a collection of 10 beautiful ambient compositions each representing an audio postcard from a different place around the world. Â Postcards is an aural exploration of places travelled, both physically and imaginatively. It invites the listener to take an imaginary vacation. Travel can be beautiful, lonely, exciting, uncomfortable and often leads to breakthroughs of our own personal barriers through introspection. With each song, the listener is transported to a new location. The music is the guide, invoking the emotions and feelings both mental and physical which one might experience while exploring a foreign place. Postcards is fueled by a curiosity to explore our innermost emotions through the act of changing our surroundings. Buyer to also receive a copy of the album on vinyl. It will be #1 of only 50 copies made & feature 1 of a kind artwork. ",
