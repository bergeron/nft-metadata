    "description": "2021 has been a busy year for Meeko and I! \n\nI got to get back out to the West coast a few times for a backpacking trip in Yosemite as well as a Summer Tahoe trip.\n\nI finally got to meet many people from our company in person as we did our first offsite together in Costa Rica. We also did a trip to NYC for an NFT conference.\n\nLast but not least, Meeko and I bought a house in October! Meeko's pumped to have a yard finally and is making good use of it.\n\nThe house needs some work but it has a lot of potential and has been a fun project. The current plan is that my Sister and Brother-in-law will be moving into the other unit in March!\n\nHere are a few pictures from the year: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1788bf6amTMuqBnQ6YYhlJOk0eSBKx008?usp=sharing\n\nWith Love,  \nNathan",
