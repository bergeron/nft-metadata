    "description": "Mau Montekio is a trance producer in Mexico. He got connected to RAWRA through the incredible Alex Purdy. In fall of 2021, Mau and RAWRA collaborated to create what became \"Collide,\" a trance pop ballad about how \"tu media naranja\" your \"other half\" might not really be it... It's the push and pull between wanting to be with someone who isn't for you and universe being like \"let 'em go bb.\" \n\nCollide was written while RAWRA was a community engagement artist in residence at the Arthouse in Syracuse, NY. Last fall (2022), they wrapped on the Collide music video in collaboration with Schnell Mode, RedHouse Theater, The Little Room Art Gallery, and special thanks to American High,  -- stay tuned for a lot of oranges getting juicy ;) ",
