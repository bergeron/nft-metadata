The shards glitter and dazzle in the light, producing a stunning array of colors and tints that dance about the figure as if it were alive with feeling.\n \"Spectrum\" delivers a profound contemplation on memory and the lasting effects of creativity and artistic expression on the human soul through this visual exhibition.",
