    "description": "A collection of 30 NFTs based on Philip Topolovacs \"I've never been to Berghain\". A full-scale cork model of the world-famous Berlin club executed in various sizes, cites a modeling technique popular in the Baroque period, thus transforming this place of longing in the present into a relic of future memories.\n\nThe limited NFT-series \"I've never been to...\" executed over many long Berlin nights in collaboration with Digital Artist Neopen, transfers Topolovacs artistic craftsmanship into a playful digital dimension, capturing fantasies, cliches and desires around this contemporary place of longing. In unique variations the owner gets a nightlife fantasy in limbo; behind glass, but close to reach.",
