    "description": "\"Virga #2\" \n\nThe rain that does not reach the ground. \n\nAn animated loop as a study of an abstracted weather phenomenon known as virga: trails of rain that fall from the underside of a cloud but evaporate or sublime before reaching the earth's surface. \n\nThe arwork was created combining traditional hand-drawing techniques with photon-prendering tools. Only one unique item exists. \n\nArtwork by Daniel Fi≈°er, 2023.\n",
