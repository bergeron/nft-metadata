    "description": "The NFT was created in the spirit of friendship across countries. Britto's neo-pop art reflects love and happiness, with a mushroom landscape that symbolizes connectedness. Did you know that mushrooms represent the world's largest community through their roots? This painting also brings people together in another way: Each NFT is linked to an individual section of the original painting, creating a community between its virtual owners. Follow this link to find your painting section: https://d2.vc/n01/virtualownership/2. Note: The number in the title and the token ID always differ by 1, because our counting goes from 1 to 1500.",
