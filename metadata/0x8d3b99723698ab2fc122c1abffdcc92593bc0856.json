    "description": "Finally, in this remote, secluded village, his search was over. The Truth was sitting by the fire in a dilapidated hut.\n\nHe had never seen an older and uglier woman.\n-  Are you - Truth?\nThe old, shriveled hag nodded solemnly.\n-  \"Tell me, what should I tell the world?\" What message to convey?‚Äù\nThe old woman looked into the fire and answered:\n-  \"Tell them I'm young and beautiful!\"\n\n\n\nThe poor Truth, it is never like itself, especially in the information war.\nEveryone has their own Truth, but the Truth is one. And she is definitely for the world.\n\n\nAfter your purchase, you will get:\n- An illustration in jpg format of 5092 x 5196 pixels\n- an animated version of the picture as mp3 in 50 mb and 100 mb size (in personal messages on twitter or instagram)\n\n+ as well as the opportunity to give this goddess a personal space in the form of a room painted by me in virtual reality.\nMost of the proceeds go to support Ukraine and its citizens.",
