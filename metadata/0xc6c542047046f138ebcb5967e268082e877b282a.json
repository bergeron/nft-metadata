    "description": "In this day and age, many of us have the feeling of being alone in this world.  \n\nTo feel as if, you have been cast to the side, and your voice is not heard. To not be represented for who you are, or for what you stand for.  \n\nThis artwork was created to capture this feeling and give platform to those that \"Stand Alone\" for that maybe their voice is heard. \n\n1/1 artwork created by Open Plains Studios\n1024\" x 1024\"\n300 DPI \n\n\n\n",
