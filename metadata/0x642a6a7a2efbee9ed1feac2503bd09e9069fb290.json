    "description": "A visual art piece by Elijah Osborne, Vision of Hope speaks of the thick and complex rainforest, often difficult to navigate, and much more so for those who lack sight. The soundscape, created by Lachi, is the climb of a hopeful late-blooming butterfly, through the darkness, against the crashing current. By following the light of hope through the dense vines and foliage, the wings of the future do guide to serenity. ‘2021, 1920x1080 HD+Audio 1:00’\n\nLegally blind since birth, Lachi uses her platform to mainstream disability inclusion discussions in Forbes, Essence, NYTimes. She is an award-winning recording artist, charting songwriter, and host of PBS segment ‘Renegades’.\n\nAdopted at an early age Elijah was diagnosed with Stargardt Disease. As a way to cope, Elijah turned to expression through drawing at four years old. \n\nRAMPD is a resource for disabled recording artists and music professionals, amplifying disability culture, promoting inclusion and accessibility in the Music Industry.",
