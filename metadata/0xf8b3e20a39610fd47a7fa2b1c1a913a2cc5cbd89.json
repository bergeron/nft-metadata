    "name": "Phantom of the forest",
    "description": "I had heard that a Black Panther had been spotted in Kabini, Nagarahole National Park (Rajiv Gandhi National Park) is a wildlife reserve in Karnataka, India. I was so excited and the wildlife photographer in me had been reawakened that I set a goal of photographing it. It was a cold February morning in 2016. I had already visited the forest perhaps twenty times, each visit lasting approximately two or three days.\nFinally, I discovered this magnificent Black Gold. He was composed and simply observed us from a 30- to 40-foot tree in the woods. It's difficult to put into words how I felt, but I feel compelled to document it on the block chain. This has been the most formative period of my life. It is something I will never forget.\n\nIt's an image that's about 1832 x 2747 px and 300 DPI. You can get a signed art print of this image that can be sent to you anywhere in the world.",
