In a lagoon lost in this magnificent country of Iceland, I had to cross the water coming from the glaciers, naked, and climb on the iceberg that I had spotted. I cut my feet and buttocks but I am extremely proud to have done so, and especially proud of the result.\n\nThe Last Dance - Photography  \nLocation : A lagoon in the Vatnajökull, Iceland  \nSelf-portrait, 2021.",
