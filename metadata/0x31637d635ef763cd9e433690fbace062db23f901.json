    "description": "Oftentimes, we find ourselves looking above at the clouds wondering, dreaming, wishing. Sometimes in life we find ourselves crusing down roads comfortably but find storms along our path, ahead of our journey ahead. Fear not, not every storm is evil nor is every tempest is ill-willed.\n\nOn June 9th, 2020 I found myself flying northward on a country back road in southeast Nebraska watching beautiful supercells erupt along a northward moving boundary. Watching the bare bones of strong storms perform their magic with the setting sun, it was heaven. On a year full of choas and commotion, there was this moment in time, just for me.\n\nCome along my journey with me and see where the road will take us. I'm sure theres beauty in the madness.\n\nOriginal first buyers of this piece may have the choice to have this printed on a medium of their chosing.",
