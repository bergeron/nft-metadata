    "description": "\"Thorns of Remembrance\" is the first in a series that explores the power of memory and the manifestation of emotions, offering a thought-provoking meditation on the ways in which our experiences shape us and the enduring impact they can have on our lives. This series encourages the viewer to reflect on the complexities of memory and emotion, as they are forced to look at the intricate and sometimes painful relationship of the two, and how they can shape our very being and future. \n\n\"Thorns of Remembrance\" is a mix of AI-generated images that blend reality and imagination, creating a dreamscape that conveys the complexity of the human mind. Various images are blended, often multiple times. The blends are then brought together in photoshop along with digital photographs.",
