    "description": "Mu is a legendary lost continent. Geologists dismiss the existence of Mu as physically impossible, arguing that a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed in the short period of time asserted in legends and folklore.\n\nBut.. MU is existing. Deep down under the water in the middle of the pacific ocean.\n\nHere are some of its proud people: a mix of humans of all kinds and aliens from near proxima zentauri which brought astonishing culture and technology. \n\nThis mix keeps the continent of MU in a stable position deep down underwater for 3000 years now.
