    "description": "time really is a precious thing. you spend a lot of it on things you don’t wanna do, with people you don’t like. thinking about things that don’t matter, stressing over a future that doesn’t even exist yet. wasting so many hours busy with life that you forget its happening, here. now. and you’re missing out on all of the things you used to dream about. it’s easy to miss the little things. but they add up. \n\nso.\n\nwhen you find someone who gives you sparks, don’t ever forget how that made you feel. love makes everything else worth it. the privilege to know someone more than anyone else. the opportunity to grow together. the challenge to build something with someone. there’s nothing like it. \n\nsome will understand. some won’t. but i do. and i hate that i do. \n\n“how did i lose you” is a conversation with loss. it’s a cry out to the past. it’s an attempt to grieve. it’s trying to accept the overwhelming weight of disappointment. the loneliness that comes from losing someone you love. it’s a funeral for someone who’s still alive. \n\neven after everything, after so much love, so much life…it was all for nothing. no explanation. simply empty promises, and a question. how did i lose you?",
