    "description": "World of Wonders  “Asperatus”\n\nAsperitas, formerly known as Undulatus asperatus, is a distinctive, rare cloud formation that takes the appearance of rippling waves. These wave-like structures form on the underside of the cloud to make it look like a rough sea surface when viewed from below.\n\nAn encounter with these clouds is rare, I was lucky to be witness of it in 2015.  Ever since this experience, I keep looking up to the sky, always on a quest to catch time in minimalism and authenticity by witnessing all beauty created by nature.\n\nThe Netherlands - 2015 - 6000 x 3375 px  \nPhotographer Marieke Feenstra / marieke.nft  \nWorld of Wonders photography collections\n\nLicense  \nThe holder is free to use the NFT for the Collector’s own personal, non-commercial use, self promotion, displayed privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays, as long as the creator is credited.
