    "description": "Grailed PUMA Slipstream NFTs are the digital representation of Wagmi-san and PUMA's collaboration. You can add these to your loadout to rack up Mission points in Battle.town, 10KTF's PFP event platform. Remixing a classic streetwear style, ERC-721 Grailed PUMA Slipstream NFTs get minted to match the 1:1 Grailed PUMA Slipstream Physicals of the original minter.\n\nGrailed PUMA Slipstream NFTs are bound to the minting wallet and can only be transferred to a different wallet by scanning the NFC chip-equipped Grailed PUMA Slipstream Physicals.",
