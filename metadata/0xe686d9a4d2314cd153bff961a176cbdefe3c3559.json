    "description": "Escape from the forest of dip pens: Throughout my 61 years of life, I saw computers arrive to my life when all my whole world was made of paper and ink. I don't know how or when, but at some time the lines turned into pixels and escaped to that digital land. My sketchbooks are now deserted and the breeze of loneliness blows inclemently into my pens and inkwells. My drawings never returned to my sketchbook, so I had no choice, went in search of them to found again in that land. How I miss my inkpen!",
