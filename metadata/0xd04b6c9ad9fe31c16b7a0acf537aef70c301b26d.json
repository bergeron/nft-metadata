    "description": "In this project series construzione space, I photographed the Savoy Homan Hotel in Bandung, Indonesia, which has an art-deco style that is identical to the architectural style of the past that was born after World War 1, then I reconstructed the building by imagining a future where buildings can float which I often see in fictional animation.",
