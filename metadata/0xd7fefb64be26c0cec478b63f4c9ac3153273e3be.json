    "description": "Physical acrylic painting on canvas turned digital, created in September 2022.\nOrig. 40x30cm / 16x12\", digital 7500x5550px.\nThis unique 1/1 NFT was created and minted by Monika's Art\n\nWith the NFT, the first owner has the right to claim the physical original of this work. The sales price of the NFT includes worldwide shipping costs and a transport insurance; a frame is not included, just the original canvas. Please note that the NFT shows a digital signature while the original canvas has a hand-made one; this is the only difference between NFT and the physical artwork. If the physical is not claimed within 6 months after the purchase, the canvas might get destroyed; shipping costs are non-refundable.\n\nAfter the purchase, contact me via MonikasArt@outlook.com, Twitter, or according to your individual preferences. All buyer information is treated with the highest confidentiality and discretion.\n\nLove, Monika",
