    "description": "Inspired by the Culture of \"GM\" lead by @CozomoMedici at #HouseofMedici and @rata_yonqui's very unique infusion of the LITizen culture, \"LITizen I: GM\" collection was born, marking this collection the first ever gesture of gratitude outside of the LIT administration, by LITizen to LITizens, in celebration of the LIT culture. \nA hint of continuity has been left in the name of the collection. This collection is the beginning of a movement that will unfold to the wildest of our imagination.\nTogether we will pave the way to the future of culture, art and entertainment.\nBy 0xBlock\nTwitter @blockmidas",
