Most importantly it's a token (pun intended) of your part in a journey bigger than the both of us.\n\nFragments are a celebration of creativity for creativity's sake, a reminder to step back and remember what made you fall in love with this crazy ride. \n\nI want you to have good memories when looking at this piece, maybe we share the privilege of a friendship, or someone you care for gave you this piece as a gift. Think of those moments and cherish them as much as I cherish you, whoever you are.",
