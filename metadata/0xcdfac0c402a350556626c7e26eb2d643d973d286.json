    "description": "“The armies of the past, the armies of the present! \nThe vows taken, the promises broken! \nGod is with us in our endeavors, God is with us in our endeavors!” they chanted. \n\nPink Skies is an attempt at discovering the dream-state in the ordinary. It’s a platonic exploration of the familiar/distant in the so-very-close. Each photograph was taken at a different time and place, but all share the same sensibility. The slippery state of the columns of reality. \n\n#1\n\nSt. Petersburg\n2019\nEdition 1/1\n3456 x 3456",
