    "description": "Hong Kong is a place where tall skyscrapers can be seen dominating the skyline by both modern and old buildings. This aerial photo was taken during my trip to Hong Kong. During the trip, I met up with other photographers to explore different parts of Hong Kong. I have always been fascinated by the concrete jungle within Hong Kong and how it will look like from bird's eye point of view, so we decided to visit this place. \n\nWe went to one of the nearby building's rooftop, so we could have a better drone to remote control signal, as I don't want to risk losing signal with the drone. After launching the drone up, I was so in awe and couldn't believe what I saw on the phone screen, the perspective from the top was incredible. We stayed there for half an hour to capture some shots from different angle. There were so many different incredible perspective that we photographed here that day but in the end, this photo here is the one that stood out to me most.",
