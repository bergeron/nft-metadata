    "description": "'formositas capti' - means 'captured beauty' in latin. It is about my sense of beauty that is being closed behind the bars of fear and panic. This serie of pictures is my personal act of resistance to this inner blocks, manifesting that life goes on and there is still beauty in it that I can capture and show to others. \n\nShot on ðŸŽž Kodak Vision 3 250D cine film using 1978 manual Canon AE-1 camera.\n\nLviv, Ukraine\nMay 2022\n\n\nAbout the collection:\n'vide venus denuo' - means 'see beauty/love again' in latin. This serie is my first attempt to make my eyes see and feel beauty again, after being in war conditions for three months. All this time, me and all Ukrainians were in locked psychological state, concentrated on survival, seeing horrors and thinking about them constantly. After a while, mind and feelings went trough transformation and realization came that life still continues and we need to live on, even with death being so close.",
