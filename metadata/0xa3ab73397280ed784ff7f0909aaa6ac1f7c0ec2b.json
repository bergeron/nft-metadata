    "description": "\nA digital progression of an original cityscape painting of Manhattan, New York, painted in mixed media on aluminium. Neo Noir tones permeate throughout this rain soaked cityscape scene.\n\nDetails: 3500px x 3500px .png\n\nThe collector has the option to receive a signed fine art print measuring 420mm x 420mm, at no extra cost, as a 1:1 special artist edition.*\n\nTo create this NYC piece, the physical painting was digitised with a Leica M (Type 240) camera, paired with a Leica Summilux-M 1:1.4/35 lens for superlative colour depth and image quality. Several images were then composited & enhanced to create the final artwork.\n\nFor further provenance, it can be viewed in the Digital Collection on my official website, where you can also see examples of my physical paintings. \n\nhttps://www.paulkenton.com/nfts/new-york-embers/\n\n*To claim your print, send a message at  at  https://www.paulkenton.com/contact, after you have settled the auction",
