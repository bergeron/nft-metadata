    "description": "Hieroglyphs by artist pxlq is one of my fav Art Blocks collections. And #781 is a fav from that collection. Amazingly, #781 already told a story - the story of Green-hatted Manbird. I mean he was undeniable, jumping out from pxlq's masterpiece for anyone to see. So I emphasized Manbird, using a few simple rules such as only 'coloring in' the lightest color (beige) sections. Then I added the cellphone for humor, convinced Manbird is a New Yorker.",
