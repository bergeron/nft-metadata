    "description": "The Barn NFT has been issued as a unique edition. \nPhoto: 6000 x 4448 px\n\nThe barn has been there for so long that the old folks in the village said their grandparents had been playing nearby while at an early age. But at some point children stopped playing there and grown-ups started avoiding the place. \n\nAfter something had occurred in the farmhouse (and no one really were willing to mention what exactly), the farm became abandoned and has been slowly decaying ever since. \n\nThose few who happened to walk past the premises at dusk said they saw things in the shadowy depth of the barn. No one believed them, yet no one showed willingness to go and see. \n\nSo the crumbling barn still stands there near the forest, waiting. There’s no sound, just the grass is swaying subtly in the breeze… \n",
