    "name": "Wild Hunt",
    "description": "Noah looks around her, the baby on her lap carefully wrapped in furs moves slightly. They are all around the fire, the ancients and the youth trying to be as close as possible to the flames. She hears the fierce wind outside the cave and the rocks cracking. Her attention drifts away and she turns her eyes toward the wall. With the moving light coming from the fire the painted scene comes to life. She remembers the felines dangerously closing the gap with the preys during this wild hunt. But they missed for this time.\n\nAmy is standing in a dark cave surrounded by parietal art. Her flashlight hit the walls. She closes her eyes and open them. She feels an ancient warmth surrounding her, spirits of old times cheering her, giving her strength. She wonders what it was like to survive in such a harsh environment. She admires the painting that depicts a wild hunt, a scene her ancestors reproduced with such beauty. She pictures herself seated by the fire, watching the dancing flames.",
