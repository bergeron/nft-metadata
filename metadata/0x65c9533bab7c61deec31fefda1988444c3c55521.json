    "description": "Much of today’s society relies heavily on materialistic things to feel or see themselves as beautiful. Men and women alike are led to believe that we aren’t much without “the added things”. \nI’ve therefore decided to present this series to challenge this perception on beauty as well as ourselves. It conveys the idea that whether you are adorned in the shiniest jewels with the fanciest clothes on or if you were just a blank canvas, you are nothing short of a piece of ART. \nMay it stand as a reminder that true beauty and wealth is what remains when they strip away everything else. \nThe important things are not in those designers that make your life seem nicer or the heels that bring you higher.\nLet’s work towards self love, being beautiful not only on the outside but most importantly inside.\n",
