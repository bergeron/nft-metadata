    "description": "Self portrait of Ryan Nellis shot under UV blue light to enhance the white spots on his skin from Vitiligo, a disorder that causes the loss of pigmentation in patches of skin. The spots first appeared in 2001 and have continually changed. Ryan calls them skin glyphs because of the secret messages they communicate to him... the inspiration to create the Biosapiens and unite humanity with nature on the blockchain and beyond. The reason for the alias Sock Master can be found by visiting RyanNellis.com. ",
