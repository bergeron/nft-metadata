    "description": "There are certain photos that always remain close tp our heart. This is one of those photos ,not only due to its surreal look but also due to the struggle behind getting the difficult composition for this  image. \n\nThe photo was shot in a Rural area of PUNJAB, PAKISTAN on a foggy morning with temperature hitting to 1-2 C. \n\n  This photo has one of the hardest composition i have ever shot. To get the whole bent tree in the frame and to get the perfect composition i have to lie down on the cold soil. \n\nArtist: Adnan_Dani\n\nMedium: Photography\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nImage specifications- 3000- 4000\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
