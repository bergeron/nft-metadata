    "description": "Photograph created completely in-camera using an analog blended negative technique, shot on 35 mm film. Colour added in post-production.\n\nBLENDED is a series of 1/1 pieces that explore the artist's journey and relationship with mental health. Each image is constructed using a technique that evokes a blending of two worlds. The addition of colour ties those worlds together and suggests the presence or involvement of the artist / viewer.\n\n1/1  \nArtist: Matt Humphrey \nDimensions: 6000 x 3773 @ 300 dpi\n\nPhysical print available to the first collector of each piece upon request.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, or in non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
