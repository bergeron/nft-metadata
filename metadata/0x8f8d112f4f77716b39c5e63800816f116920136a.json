    "description": "One day I went outside to capture some scene and it was raining, there I saw a child holding an umbrella in one hand and a book in another, walking on a railway track and a spark or joy and pleasure can easily be seen through his face and hence this reminds me of \"My Childhood\" where we all are free to live and enjoy. So I stop, I look and i captured it. (This track is basically a Mughalpura railway track in railway Pakistan)      \nThis image won Sony World Photography Award 2017 ( National Award )\n\nBody : Nikon D750\nLens : Nikon 70-200 F/2.8 Vr2\nDimension : 6016*4016\nLocation : Lahore, Pakistan  ",
