    "description": "6000x4000px\nEdition 1/1 \n\nThe streets are everyones stage where no one can hide, i like that simple fact. It is a scene of chaos, surprises and not at least human expression. It is also the moment of encounter. IÂ´m always trying to face things conscious, sometimes i like to get in touch with my subjects, other times i prefer to stay the silent observer. As a Street Photographer, it is my job to preserve these moments. \n\n\n",
