Death to the physical things, death to what happens along your journey in life. \n\nThe death you need to die might be people talking you down, pulling you down on your way up, death to not seeing all these always keep you focus on your goals. \n\nDeath to self weakness helps build you through the journey of life. This death are what brings you the honor at the end of it all. ",
