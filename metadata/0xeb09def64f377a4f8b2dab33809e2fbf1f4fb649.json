    "description": "One of the freakiest moments I've had while shooting this collection. I got to this tree just before sunset and fired off a few shots to make sure the composition was right. A few cars had driven past, which is normal, it's a fairly busy road for miners. \n\nBut there was this one car that drove past, then stopped about 200 metres up the road and stayed for there for a bit. I don't think much of it and kept shooting. A few minutes later this same car drove past again and stopped again, then did a U-turn and slowly crept towards where I was. At this stage I started to wonder what they were up to. \n\nWhen they parked near my car I started walking towards them and shone my torch right at them. They eventually drove off.\n\nAnother car had driven past and done the same thing, but only past once and back again and kept driving. By this stage I was done, I wasn't hanging around anymore. I got in the car and started driving home. I got about 10km away and I got pulled over by the cops.\n\nApparently someone had called them, and thought my car had been stolen. I'll add that this isn't the safest place to be out alone.",
