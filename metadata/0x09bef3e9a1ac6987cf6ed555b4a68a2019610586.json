    "description": "Artist and producer bloody white offers an otherworldly musing in his new song, “SOMETHING OF AN ARTIST” for HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1. The hypnotizing, gentle lull of the track conjures a daydream—like playing a grand piano on a hot summer day in the countryside a la Call Me By Your Name. It’s romantic, beautiful, and full of angst. Seeking a breakthrough, bloody white turned to the piano.\n\n“Make it hurt, hurt, just a little bit,” sings bloody white. “I’m so ignorant. I bleed out… Something of an artist. I’m selfish.”  \n\nAs the title hints, he’s exploring the nature of identifying as a self-proclaimed artist. Struggling to toe the line between the trope of artistic narcissism and egoless creative expression. He pours it all into his music. \n\n----\n\nThis is the eighth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
