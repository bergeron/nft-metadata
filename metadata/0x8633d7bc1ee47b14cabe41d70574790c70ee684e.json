    "description": "This is the first in a series of mint experiments. We are exploring new ways to fund web3 based non-profits, humanitarian efforts, and foundations. While no utility is promised, we plan to find fun and inventive ways to use these tokens. Web3 can solve many of the world's biggest problems, and minting this NFT is an invitation to be a part of this experiment in using this technology to solve real-world problems. All funds will go to the Solar Foundation.\n\nThe Solar Foundationâ€™s mission is to fund solar projects in under-served communities in emerging markets and developing economies. We want to reinvent the non-profit and NGO model using the tools of web3. We are experimenting with new models to help underserved communities access clean energy and have an ownership stake in the solar deployed in their community. The Solar Foundation will fund these projects through donations, micro-loans, and other funding mechanisms. Public goods should empower communities; we believe access to electricity is a public good! \n\n",
