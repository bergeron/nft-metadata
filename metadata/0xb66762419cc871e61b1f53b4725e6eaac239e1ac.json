I would feed a prompt into the computer that would try to recreate what the final moments of the earth would look like before destruction.. I was given four images, but one was not like the rest.. I would receive this beautiful piece of what looks like the exact opposite of my prompt, but it was gorgeous.\n\nI was so thrilled to be able to make something so beautiful and capture what I felt was a perfect scene from a world that we will never know. This was not moments before disaster, but yet, moments before disruption.\n\nThis piece was made with AI (Midjourney)",
