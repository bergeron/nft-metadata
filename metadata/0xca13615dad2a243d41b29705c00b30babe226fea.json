    "description": "This is my winning illustration for the Yurei Spirit collection's art contest! This artwork features Yurei's 1/1 character, \"The Hunter\" with his soul absorbing katana. I've added the masks of fallen Yurei that were his unfortunate victims. I also introduced a snake into the illustration to symbolise his character, and the fear he instills in all his opponents.",
