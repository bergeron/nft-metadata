    "description": "A piece I created to showcase the austere grandeur of mountain scenery. The blazing light in this scene can give a sense of warmth and relaxation. During my several weeks of teaching workshops in the Canadian Rockies, I had a vision to create images that would help spread light to my viewers. Light is a healing thing and I love to accentuate it in most of my work.",
