    "description": "The tar on the feet is still warm as I walk around, making my own way in a crowd that is occupied being full of themselves. Bottled up emotions, everywhere. I protect myself with the boundaries I build every single day. My sanity is much more important than pleasing others for their validation.\n\nI pull out my claws just to protect myself but I am soft inside and you know that. I walk with my head held high and feet still on the ground. There's smoke around, smoke that fills human hearts and minds with filthy desires and unsaid emotions. It's okay, I say, I understand because at one point of time, I have been a human. I know how it feels. Tonight, I see you from crystalline eyes and a washed out heart for I know, for you to know, it might take much more time to walk my path, live my life and smell my shoes.\n\nTonight, I forgive you.\n\n2400 X 3000 px\nFile Format PNG \n",
