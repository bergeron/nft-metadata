    "description": "THE FIRST OF THE SERIES\nworks of progress: dangerous \n\nWHAT IS WORKS OF PROGRESS\nwe are tapping into our vault of early demos to release a series on sound.xyz... new drop every two weeks\n\nsome of these songs may evolve and be released traditionally and some not.. but these early versions will live forever on Sound and we love them.\nwe will be creating a guild.xyz to integrate with our Discord for our holders of these “Works of Progress”. this will be a place to chime in and offer feedback & ideas, basically crowdsourcing a braintrust of people invested in the vision of the songs and the Beauty School Dropout project.\n\ndangerous was the first song every written by this band so it seems fitting for it to be the first of the series. \n\nour sonic style has evolved in so many ways since this session, and it’s important to revisit the early work to see where we came from. there is still magic in here.\n\none thing we’ve come to enjoy is while learning what this band is and how to make music for it, we made many “mistakes” sonically. we wanted to make big rock guitar sounds but had to learn how to do that first. In the tinkering and toying with sounds, sometimes something new would be created.. obstacles make opportunity and that is where the magic lies. \n\nhere is dangerous.. the first of the works of progress series ",
