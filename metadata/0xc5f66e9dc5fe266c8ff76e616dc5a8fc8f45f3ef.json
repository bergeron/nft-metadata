    "name": "The fish rots from the head",
    "description": "In the original in old Russian it sounds like this: \"Чудо-рыба-рыба кит\" and in translation means \"big wonderful fish whale\".\n\nUnfortunately, my work does not have a fabulous connotation. Everything in it is real and its name speaks for itself: when fish solemnly celebrate life at the head and on the back and burn millions at social receptions, on the belly on favelas, in ruins, in ghettos and factories, real life goes on. But there is only one paradox: dirt and rot is not only below. There is much more of it in offices and ceremonial halls. The marble steps and golden candilabras are drenched in the blood and sweat of those at whose expense these parties are held.",
