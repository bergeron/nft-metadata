    "description": "Aligned depicts the fruits of ecological healing and harmony when Black women reclaim their power and spacial imagination by reconnecting with nature. After years of displacement, emotional and physical injury where our environment was used against us, we have found ourselves dispersed throughout The West and trapped in man-made concrete jungles that make it near impossible for us to find said healing. In a world that constantly tells Black women that we arenâ€™t worthy of safety, holding and taking up space outdoors is imperative for both our mental, physical and spiritual wellbeing.",
