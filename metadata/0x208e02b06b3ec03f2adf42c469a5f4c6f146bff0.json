    "description": "We all have defects. Weaknesses. Shortcomings. \nAnd we often hide them by lying. \n\nPeople want to look better than they are and I don’t just mean in a physical way. It’s our reality that sometimes we all wear masks and try to appear better. \n\nI don’t know can we live in a world where everyone will be honest. But I‘m trying to avoid lies and just be myself. \n\nWhat about you?",
