    "description": "Colour In Motion is a unique piece I created unintentionally, sometimes as an artist your mind can feel complicated and its tough to get your ideas out. When I drew this I was trying to clear my mind and allow myself the freedom to just play around with the creative patterns my hand felt the urge to draw. From overwhelming black & white to a refreshing kaleidoscope of colours, this animation takes you through the transformation of colour as it flows in and out.",
