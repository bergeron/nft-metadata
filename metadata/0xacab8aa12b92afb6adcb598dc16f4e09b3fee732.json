    "description": "There are nights in New York City where taking a walk alone feels like a dream. Nights when the snow falls so slowly and the lights are so faint, that it makes everything look like a slow motion clip of a movie. Those nights when you look around and get lost in thought. A magical feeling that makes you realize that nothing else matters but here and now. A flash that in a split of a second makes you forget you were lonesome moments ago. These nights don’t happen often but when they do, they stick around in your mind forever. \n\nSony A1\nG Master 50mm 1.2\nISO 800\nExposure time 1/400\nF/1.2\nDimensions 5707 × 8560\n300 Dpi",
