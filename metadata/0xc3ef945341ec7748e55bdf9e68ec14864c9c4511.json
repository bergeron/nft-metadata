    "description": "« Dreaming at sunset »\n\nIn her dream, she found herself standing on the edge of a vast ocean, the waves crashing against the shore below her. She looked out to the horizon, where the sun was sinking into the sea, casting a golden glow over everything around her.\n\nAs the dream began to fade and the sun dipped below the horizon, the woman awoke, feeling both exhilarated and perplexed. She wondered what the dream meant, and why she felt such a strong connection to the sunset and the ocean.\n\nBy Cosmo Danchin-Hamard.",
