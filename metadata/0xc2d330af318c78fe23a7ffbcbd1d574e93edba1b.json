    "description": "**Regression**\n\nThis piece represents backwards progress I was feeling with my personal growth journey. The body is softly melting into itself while there is an external pressure forcing things inward and to retreat. The vast and empty landscape represents a sense of loneliness that occurs in this journey. After I started to unmask, I felt myself losing some of the skills I had acquired during my life while I was masking.",
