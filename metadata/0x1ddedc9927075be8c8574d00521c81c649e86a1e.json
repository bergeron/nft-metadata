    "description": "The third set of 10 sonic vignettes from \"Old Friends New Cities\" is a collage of 8mm film shot by filmmaker Blythe Thomas in and around the house I grew up in, in Long Island New York. \n\nLiving in the blinks between timezones, I’ve documented the last 10 years of my life through 1000+ microsongs – threads of transient nostalgia captured on tape.\n\nNow trading nature immersion for urban hustle, I’m knitting together the last decade via release. \n\nI hope you'll enjoy,\n-dessauer",
