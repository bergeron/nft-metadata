    "description": "Sitka Alaska or as the Tlingit call it Sheet’ká \"People on the Outside of Baranof Island,\".\n\nSitka is surrounded by around 85 mountains and sits on the Sitka Sound leading to the Pacific Ocean. Sitka has rich history even being a major Russian Town before being purchased by the United States, and you still see the Russian Influence today in the buildings. \n\nSitka Also sits on the upper end of the Pacific Northwest. Many who don't know usually just think the PNW represents WA & OR but it runs from the Coastal Towns of SE Alaska All the way to California. \n\nThis image captured is a couple of the mountain ranges that you can see from Sitka. Rising up from the Pacific and surrounded by Old Growth these amazing mountains always leave me in aww whenever I travel to Sitka Alaska",
