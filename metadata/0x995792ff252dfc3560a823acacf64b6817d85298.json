    "description": "Inspired by a real RARE 1896 One Silver certificate, I present to you all, my 1 Ethereum Crypto Note!! The og silver certificate was produced by the US Treasury and they produced over 20 million of those things! And very few still exist in our current time. Also, that note is rated #7 in the top 100 currencies of all time!\n\n\nBack in the day, we had coins. Then smart people got to thinking and said 'hey why don't we have paper money that represents whole loads of amounts of coins?!?' Then shortly later is when real paper money was born. I say the same thing. However, with cryptocurrency. Crypto Notes could be part the future 1:1 amount holder in the metaverse of the crypto world! \n\n\nThis is meant to be a long term and RARE collection! There will be a limited number of the notes so get them while they last!\n\n\nMint 2 if you can as these will be burnable. When the time comes you can burn your Ethereum Crypto Note and you will receive 2 new nfts! Please enjoy and thank you for your support!",
