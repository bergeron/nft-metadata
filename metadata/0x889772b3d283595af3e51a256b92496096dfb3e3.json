    "description": "The Super PUMA Comic Collection tells the story of Super PUMA and Evil PUMA after the events in the PUMA Archive.\n\nUpcoming comics will be distributed in a variety of ways that may require community engagement and participation. Collecting the full Season 1 set is probably something.\n\nThe Super PUMA Comic Collection is an extension of the Super PUMA PFP Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/super-puma\n\nSuper PUMA PFP and Comics are complementary to PUMA’s other ongoing NFT project, the Nitro Collection, which will continue to be PUMA’s vehicle to release new innovative shoe designs.\n\nNitro Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/nitrocollectionpuma",
