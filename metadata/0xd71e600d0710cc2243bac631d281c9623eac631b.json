    "description": "Title: „Kok Boru“    \nCreator/Artist: Anne Schmeltzer  \nTime limited open edition\n\nKok Boru (meaning \"grey wolf\") is the national sport of Kyrgyzstan. It's a horseback competition, which is traditionally played for amusement as well as to improve physical and mental strength and skills. There are two teams, whose players are - from the horse - trying to grab a beheaded animal carcass, usually a goat or a sheep, and throw it in the goal, for example consisting of a tire. The teams will consistently try to steal the \"ball\" from each other and score the most goals.  \nIn this picture here you can see how skilled the riders and horses are, they often trained for years. The rider is grabbing the sheep's leg to pick it up, while his horse is steadily galloping, leaving the other riders behind.\n\n1/1250 sec  \nf/5.6  \n105mm  \nISO 252\n\n3200 x 4000 px  \n \nSong-Kul, Kyrgyzstan, 2019\n\nLicense: The NFT holder is free to display the NFT privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, as long as the creator is credited.
