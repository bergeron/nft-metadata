    "description": "Due to the full-scale WAR with Russia, who aggressively invaded our country I decided to focus all our efforts on charity projects.\n\nWe stand for our country and we do everything we can to help our relatives, team members, friends, and people of Ukraine to survive in these terrifying times. We all need to act, be united and help as much as we can. Today we are launching this charity initiative to stop the Humanitarian Crisis.\n\n100% of proceeds from these auctions will be donated directly to small charity and volunteer organizations to speed up the process of receiving the funds by people in Ukraine in need.\n\n3000x4000px",
