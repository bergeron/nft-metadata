    "description": "After first visiting Bangkok in 2015, I returned in the summer of 2019 to photograph & learn more about Takraw, the most dynamic sport I’ve ever witnessed. I revisited the courts where I'd fallen in love with the takraw in order meet the players & watch pickup games played in large part by local taxi drivers & refugees from neighboring countries such as Myanmar & Laos — often late into the evening, before or after their shifts. As I got to know the players, I learned what beers they preferred to drink, who was most revered on the court, as well as witnessed the unique bonds they shared as a result of meeting each night to play. The photographs in 'Takraw' are meant to draw attention to the dynamism & beauty of the sport along with those who have mastered it.\n\n\n(A portion of sales will go to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to help protect refugees and statelessness in Thailand.)",
