    "description": "At the KnockOff Labs, our experimental cross breeding and genesplicing to create the perfect knock off is rarely successful. Our poor little cheetah monkey still can't get his tongue back in.\n\nThis specimen was found roaming around a deserted island, probably the result of some weird cross breeding ritual performed by members of a boat club who abandoned it.  \nIt seemed to have an affinity for chewed up bubble gum, so we gave it some. After blowing this beautiful bubble we were able to grab this photo. Unfortunately it popped and sent the creature on a bunny hopping monkey biting rage fit. 4 people were injured.  \nOnce again proving you should not mess with mother nature.",
