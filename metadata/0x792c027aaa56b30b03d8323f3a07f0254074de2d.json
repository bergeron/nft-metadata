    "description": "I miss the days where I would wake up full with energy\nAnd would be excited to start my day.\nI miss the days when I would find joy in the smallest of things.\nI miss when I didn’t have to worry about my future\nlife didn’t matter at the time, I was free, alive, and happy\nI miss that. \nWhy can’t I feel that again? Man I would do anything to feel alive again. We live in a world with 7 billion people, but yet we feel so alone. \nThing is I know people go through the things I’m going through, but it’s not the same. That doesn’t give me hope bc I feel like I’m battling through this alone.\nSometimes wish I'd stayed inside my mother\nNever to come out.\n",
