    "description": "A Dark Easter is upon us. Bunny was transformed by Pepe on Fauna Island. The Easter Bunny was his second experiment, soon after the zombie disaster on Pastel Island. Bunny was never the same again. Her eyes shine as a broken tv, craving for \"fresh eggs\", from which she eats and drinks the flavor of life. The story of Easter Bunny and the Eggs started this way. And up to this day, if you find Bunny, she will let you live and give you a wish if you bring her a \"fresh egg\" - the larger the better."
