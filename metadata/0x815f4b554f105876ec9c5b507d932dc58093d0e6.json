    "description": "MISSSTELLAR | ACCEPT \n\nAbout : \n\nThis work is a derivative piece from the original art of ‘Missstellar’, the pink-haired girl collection that I drew the girl character to represent the concept of emotional feelings that I had started using her on OpenSea. (https://opensea.io/collection/missstellar). And this piece I want to develop her and previous style to match with my new style on recent works (https://foundation.app/collection/ssslit) to find out my own identity for my long term.\n\n\nConcept :\n\nGrowth is not only shaped by ideal happiness but it is also melted with suffering, lessons, pain, trials. Sometimes growth is truly complete when we stop rejecting it but accept things both good and bad to forge oneself, and stop complaining or blaming but understand and accept that both things are ingredients of life. \n\nSize : \n3000 x 4000 \n\nMissstellar Young.  \nArtist  \n",
