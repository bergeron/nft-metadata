    "description": "The flow and movement of the ocean replaces the material of the dress, and the water follows the dance of the ballerina.\n\nDance as a metaphor evokes connection, freedom, creativity, improvisation, beauty, emotion, and meaning. Combine the flow of the ocean with the beauty of dance, to get Water Ballerinas.",
