    "description": "I live on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and I have a great passion for lighthouses. The lighthouse is such an island of stability and clarity in the midst of a raging and uncontrollable element. A soft light points the way through the abyss. I see this as a metaphor of hope, which gives strength to go through your life path.",
