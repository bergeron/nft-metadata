    "description": "A wall surface of a building that I found while taking a snapshot of Tokyo. The overlapping curves and straight lines of the pattern reflected on the wall. Randomly laid figures. The geometric and complex image gave me the impression of distorting space-time and gravity. It was as if I was floating in a wormhole, jumping through time and space, away from reality like in science fiction.\n\nTokyo is full of multifaceted attractions. It is both historical and progressive, a city with a charm that is difficult to describe in a few words. What was the moment when your curiosity and imagination were inspired by the extraordinary space that is Tokyo? It was a moment in which reality and virtuality blurred together, a moment in which there was room for imagination. I hope that this collection will be an opportunity to find a glimpse of the charm of the city of Tokyo, as well as the curiosity to look at the city's still unseen moments.",
