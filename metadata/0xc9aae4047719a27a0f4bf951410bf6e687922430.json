    "description": "On a cold winter day, I was fascinated by the sight that I encountered at -25 degrees at sunrise, at that moment I was feeling very lucky. Mist, trees and the lonely Horse were perhaps the most special moments of my photography journey. Taking that photo at that moment and in that cold is an indescribable feeling.\nPhoto by İsmail Taşgeldi 1/1",
