    "description": "Growing horizontally out of a windswept cliff, this Scottish wee tree symbolises for me resilience and the will to live like no other.\n\nI have been photographing this tree almost every year since 2009, following his slow, hard growth and the development of his gnarly branches. Every year, when I return to the Isle of Skye, I am afraid not to see it anymore; every year, when I see it again, I rejoice witnessing the power of resilience.\n\nThis NFT comes with a signed metal print and funds the planting of 500 trees.\n\nScotland 2017 | 5000 x 3750 px",
