Like toilets, we have to put up with feces that doesn't belong to us. We feel depression, pain or despair. But as long as we donâ€™t give up and continue to work towards our ideal life, we will surely find the light of hope. Press the flush button on the toilet, empty the feces, and keep moving forward.",
