    "description": "LA-based, Australian electronic producer, artist, and ASTRO founder TWERL has dazzled web3 with his delicious melodic soundscapes. Now he takes us on a new journey with “WTF,” ushering in a heavier era of TWERL.\n\nHere's how TWERL describes “WTF,” his latest track:\n\n“I'm starting to care less about opinions and just doing what feels natural to me,” he says. “The last couple of years I've done mostly melodic stuff, but I really enjoy the heavier stuff. It's fun to play at shows. That’s the way my sets are, heavier trap music.” \n\nCreating with confidence and abandon, TWERL is right at home with “WTF.” His sound, melodic or heavy, is unmistakably measured, tight, and addictive.\n\n----\n\nThis is the third track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE. \n\nRead our interview with TWERL here: https://noisedao.mirror.xyz/txre50BkvcYEEmf_yVclNdS2Emkg-HfaemZzO3k766g",
