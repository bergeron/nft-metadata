    "description": "The \"FUSION\" NFT 3D-art project was exhibited at MIS - MUSEUM OF IMAGE AND SOUND in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil from May 14 until June 26 and was extended until July 10, 2022.\n\nFUSION appears as a digital 3D metamorphosis of light, form, movement and sound.\n\nThe background image is based on a iPhone photo of the KAM work \"Love Board\". The photo was later modified through image manipulation. The same background was also defined as environment image for the 3D animation and reflects in each of the sphere's facets.\n\nThe sounds were generated in lower areas to harmoniously support the smooth movement of the slowly changing silvery shape.\n\n3D Animation\n1920 x 1080\n60 s\nMP4\nH.264\n\n#nft #nftcollector #cryptoartist #cryptoart #cryptoartcollector #modernart #3d #new",
