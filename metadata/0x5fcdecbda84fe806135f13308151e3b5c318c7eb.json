    "description": "Sometimes a person reaches a point where nothing has meaning for him/her. His desires, his dreams, his thoughts and ideas are all in absolute darkness. Somewhere in the depths of his mind, he is looking for an opening of hope, but he can't find a way other than boredom and helplessness. Darkness grows and completely covers his body and soul. Unfortunatly this is the beginning of a painful and gradual death.\n\n1080 (FHD) \n1080x1080 px",
