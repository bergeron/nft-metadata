    "description": "This work is a reflection on Russia, the country I grew up in. I always felt as if the world around me was alien and that I didn't belong here. For a while I didn't think about the problems around me, because I had to make up my mind about my career, do my own thing, and develop. I was young. I just wasn't paying attention to anything.\n\nI just watched and watched and watched until it was too late. I grieve for everyone, those who will die and those who will stay alive broken and traumatized. For the Russians and Ukrainians. For those who stayed and those who left.\n\nFuck wars.\nFuck tyrants.\nStrength to anyone whose illusions also collapsed like mine.",
