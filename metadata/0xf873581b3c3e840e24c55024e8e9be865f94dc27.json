    "description": "Elements is a collection inspired by the visual components of art including color, form, line, shape, space, texture, and value. Machine learning was used to build a library for every component separately, and then they were combined in different ways to create each unique work. While properties are assigned to each piece of art in the metadata, the aesthetic value must be assessed by you. ",
