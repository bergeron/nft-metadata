    "description": "The Storm, Spain 2022.\n\nHome Away From Home (Spain - Thailand 2022-2023),  \nfollows my family 4 month long journey abroad. I led my camera and heart lead the way, creating an intuitive register of the familial, social and natural landscapes I encountered during this time.\n\nThe images draw lines between the magical and mundane world as I daydream, wander and wonder. They reflect on the intrinsic family lingo and shared rituals that turn any place we inhabit in our \"home\". The images that tell their own story, throwing clues and symbols so the viewer can grasp their truth.\n\nThis series aims to answer the questions I started to ask myself since I migrated, leaving my homeland and family behind and started building a new life,\n\nwhat, where, who is home?",
