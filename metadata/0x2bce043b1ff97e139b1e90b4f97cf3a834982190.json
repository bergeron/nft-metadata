    "description": "Phillip K. Dick's influence is almost all-encompassing. His impact on topics such as consciousness and virtual reality is so extensive that it has become ingrained in the fabric of the collective unconscious.\n\n\nAs a result of this wide-ranging impact, Dick's form is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from the general cultural zeitgeist. His ideas have seeped so deeply into mainstream culture that they are often taken for granted, woven into the background noise of society.\n\n\nI find it enthralling to witness the ways in which his conceptions persist to mold our world, and how the world in turn molds our perception of him and his legacy.",
