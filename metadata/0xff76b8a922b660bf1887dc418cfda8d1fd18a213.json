I can only imagine the number of times that Frank Morris, Clarence and brother John Anglin rehearsed in their minds sizing out and taking on the elements of the vast open sea every time they stepped out onto this courtyard right under the constant, hawkish gaze from the prison tower. Even if they make it past the wall, they still have the vast open sea to deal with. But their dreams were too strong, their hopes high, their triumph real. And so on June 11, 1962, they did the rarest thing. That is pretty much the reason to call this NFT Unlockable Content AZ1441, AZ1476, AZ1485.  \n\n\n\nCollection:     Unlockable Content\n\nOwner:             MSA\n\nDate Taken:     Fall, 1984\n\nDimension:         2435 x 1722, 13cm x 9cm (Original)\n\nSize:            288 KB\n\nPaper:             Kodak \n\nTime of Day:     Afternoon\n\nMedium:         Analog\n\nLocation:         Recreation Yard, Alcatraz Prison, San Francisco, USA\n\n",
