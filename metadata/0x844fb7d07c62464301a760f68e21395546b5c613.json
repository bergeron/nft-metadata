    "description": "As the prehistoric primates wandered through the fluorescent-lit aisles of the supermarket, they marveled at the endless rows of neatly packaged goods. One of them picked up a box of cereal and shook it, as if expecting a small animal to leap out. Another sniffed at a carton of milk and recoiled in disgust, unsure what to make of the white liquid. They all looked confused and a little overwhelmed, like they had stumbled into a strange new world that they weren't quite ready for. But as they made their way to the checkout line, they couldn't help but feel a little triumphant. After all, they had managed to navigate the aisles without getting trampled by a mammoth or bitten by a sabre-toothed tiger. As far as prehistoric shopping trips go, it was a success.\n\nArtist - Mike Schmidt\nAI Rendered: Midjourney V5\nAI Rendered Description - Chat GPT (Fiction)\nEdition - 1/1",
