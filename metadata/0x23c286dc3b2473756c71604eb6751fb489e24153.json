    "description": "FLOURISH  \nThis generation's Rothkos grew up with video games, TV, and the internet. For me, it was Atari 2600, dial-up, and VHS tapes that had been recorded over multiple times until the original material had been lost to the noise. What was left were echoes, errors, and pixel dust. \n\nMaybe that's all we ever were... just a flourish in the static. \n\nINFLUENCES  \nVHS, the Multiverse, Higher dimensional reality, Atari 2600, Josef Albers, LSD, Love, and London \n\nABOUT 'PIXELISM'  \nPIXELISM describes a contemporary abstract art, influenced by video games, TV, and computation. Glitches, twitches, loops, and repeats, canvases that become their own brush - cannibalising themselves on the way to a new form. Pixelism is the place where abstract expressionism and minimalism intersect with lives lived on screen.",
