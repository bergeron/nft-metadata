    "description": "This is a handmade drawing of a real Ukrainian Soldier.\n\nI made this portrait to support women living in Ukraine at the time of the Russian invasion (February, 2022)\n\nWomen around the world suffer the consequence of wars, created mostly by men.\n\nBut women also fight back in order to defend freedom and I want to do my part to support them.\n\nI will use all proceedings from the sale of this NFT to buy NFTs from Ukrainian Women, allowing them to have some income during the war, in order to support themselves and their families.\n\nThis portrait was made with my unique technique of drawing with my fingers on a smartphone, using a free app.\n\nWatch a 2min video showing how I've created this NFT on my twitter page at https://twitter.com/Manullcc",
