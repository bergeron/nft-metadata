    "description": "I took off with a drone at the train station. While taking pictures from different angles, I noticed a shortcoming in the future. There was no part of the train tracks. So what happened to the train that passed there? Isn't it like that in our life? Aren't we always missing a piece? here is my unique artwork photo. Only 3 copies of this special photo will be produced. You can support me by purchasing.",
