    "description": "I walked in the sand. Near the sea.\nI remember this. \n\nIt was a cloudy day during fall, a few years ago. The wind was blowing very hard and the cold air hit my face. My cheeks were red because of the cold. \n\nBut despite this freezing weather, I continued my journey, walking in the sand. Near the sea.",
