    "description": "Jathilan is one of the oldest dances on the island of Java and originated from Yogyakarta. The performance is to commemorate the atmosphere of the battlefield in ancient times. Before and during the show, a shaman performs a ritual that summons supernatural beings to possess the dancers. \n\nAfter being possessed by ancestor spirits, they will do scary things like eating sharp objects, raging hysterically, dancing until limp unconscious, and slashing themselves with a machete without feeling pain or hurt. These are the mantras to summon the spirits that usually chanted along with offerings, and it's written in ancient Javanese language :\n\nNarapas araning geni\nNurmanik araning menyan\nSanggondo kukusing menyan\nNiat isun ngobong dupo\nKudu dupo mbekteni\n\nHai jebuk arum araning menyan\nKrenges araning menyan\nMego mendung kukusing menyan\nUmbulno langit sepitu\nAmblesno bumi sepitu\nTampakno niatku ngaweruhi",
