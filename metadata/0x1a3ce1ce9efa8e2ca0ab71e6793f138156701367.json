    "description": "The Sunset Dancer\n\n\nLiving in Waikiki, I am truly blessed to witness some of the top surfers and athletes in Hawaii and across the globe.\nSurfing on a long board is so poetic, and each surfer has their own unique style packed with a lot of grace.\n\nOne late afternoon as the sun was setting, I knew it was going to burn for awhile after. I got my camera housing all ready and started to swim out. It was getting darker, but I kept going.\nSeeing the sunlight sparkle through the peaks of the waves was pure magic. I found my spot.\n\nA small set started to roll in, a girl took off.\nThe way she got up and moved so freely, the way the sunset was beaming behind her, it was like she was dancing on the water. I didn’t know whether to look through my lens, to shoot or just to watch her, but i’ll never forget the moment. Snap. It was over in seconds but it felt like an infinity of time had passed. I was in awe. The Sunset Dancer was born.\n\n\"Surfing is attitude dancing.\"\n\n\nWaikiki Beach, O’ahu, Hawai’i.",
