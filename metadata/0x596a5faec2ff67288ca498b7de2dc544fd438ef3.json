    "description": "I started this photographic series of flowers as a way to explore color, manipulating light and bouncing reds, blues and greens methodically to create something. Eventually it evolved into poetry, a dance of time moving around flowers with colors to create a language solely individual to each photograph.\n\nThis series isn't a representation, it is the language and poetry of flowers.",
