    "description": "The ancient Silk Road, founded in the 2nd century BC, connected entire civilizations. It got its name because of the silk that was transported by caravans from China to the West. But, in addition to the unique fabric, it was of great importance in the exchange of not only goods, but also knowledge, culture and other things, which had a great influence on history.\n\nThis collection is not historically accurate. This is an attempt to convey the atmosphere and mood of that period of time, through the prism of the life of ordinary people and their history.\n\nMade with AI+Photoshop  \n3000x1714 px  \n300dpi",
