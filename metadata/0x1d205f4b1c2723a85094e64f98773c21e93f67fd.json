It represents the courage and resilience of those who have fought and continue to fight for equal rights and justice for all. The vibrant colors of the rainbow remind us of the diversity of humanity and the beauty that comes from embracing our differences. As the scroll stretches on endlessly, it symbolizes the ongoing struggle for equality and the need for continued effort and progress towards a more inclusive society. The rainbow scroll serves as a powerful reminder that we must all work together to create a world where everyone is treated with respect and dignity",
