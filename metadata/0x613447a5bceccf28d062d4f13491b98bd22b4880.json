    "description": "THE WITNESS by Rupture, 2023\n\nPart of the SPECTACLE collection\n\nFrom its vantage point, the witness surveys the chaos below with a detached, almost otherworldly gaze. A silent observer, they take in the frenzied activity, seemingly oblivious to the grand spectacle unfolding before them.\n\nDespite the chaos and turmoil that surrounds them, the witness remains serene and unruffled. Even in the midst of the most turbulent storms, there is always stillness to be found.",
