    "description": "Kungliga slotten is a UNESCO World Heritage.\n\nDrottningholm Palace, the Royal Palace of Sweden. Special about this location is that the Royalties of Sweden still take residents in the palace. Remarkable architecture, originally the palace was built in the late 16th century. Being enriched by two styled gardens, Baroque and English, these grounds are of utmost pleasant to wander and ponder about life.\n\nThis fine art piece is a lost photograph, discovered years after being taken. With the experience and knowledge of the current, the artwork has been processed carefully. This photograph holds one of my most precious memories of Sweden.",
