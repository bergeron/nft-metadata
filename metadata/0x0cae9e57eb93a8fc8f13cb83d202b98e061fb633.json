    "name": "Didi is saying enough.",
    "description": "Mixed media on 30x21 cm paper. The Hebrew letters can be read as enough enough or Didi, a feminine and masculine name. Over the years I have destroyed hundreds of works, some where very good, due to the difficulty of coping with life. My works show childhood places, and emotional struggles. Creation is my life axis, and also animals. I creates in a variety of areas. Didi is a girl / woman whose face is pleasant but her body is conflicted. Despite everything, she smiles.",
