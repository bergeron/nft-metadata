    "description": "I wrote 'In the Leaves' about a dream I had before I decided to quit my stable, full-time design job.\n\nIn the dream I kept waking up outside — on the sidewalk in San Francisco, and later in the leaves by a road. I kept choosing that over my bed, and it felt surprisingly calm to wake up outside of my home.\n\nI had a session with Benji Cormack and we talked about this dream and how it seemed to mirror my life choice of staying in the comfort of a full-time job or leaving to focus on music and being satisfied with less.\n\nI quit the job and now I've put out the song.\n\n\"I'm waking in the leaves again\nUnder street signs, never needed more.\nMapping out the turns I take\nWhen I sleepwalk, why's it feel like home?\"\n\nWritten by: Benji Cormack, Lyrah\nProduced by: Nick Booth, Benji Cormack, Jon Wienner, Lyrah\nArtwork by: Brendan Lowry",
