    "description": "Exploring in the backcountry of Japan, we stumbled upon this abandoned building. The snow had piled up on top of and around it, and upon seeing it, I knew at once I had to ski it. I set up a camera for my friend and continued to climb a sketchy ladder on the back of the building. Standing on top, beside the chimney, I looked down at an urban pillow line waiting for me.\n\n3...2...1...Dropping! I sent it off the roof in style, nailing the grab and stomping the landing. This is a rare moment where I'm the one in front of the camera doing what I love. Photography is my medium, but skiing is my true passion. You don't always need mountains to have an epic time on snow.\n\nThis is a limited bidder's edition for any bidders on the 1/1 piece \"Send it!\"",
