    "description": "The work is developed from a documentation video of the mixed media installation \"Thinking about me\" (T.a.m.) 2018 at the Mediation Biennale Poznan, Poland.  Two visually overlapping self-portraits of the artist were projected onto the wall of a former slaughterhouse. The first portrait is generated by an experimental apparatus using overhead projection: 3-D miniatures circulate in a glass bowl placed on the glass plate of the OHP, driven by a pump system. The shadows of the miniatures, e.g. pedestrians, scooter drivers, a wedding couple are projected into the silhouette of a Janus-headed self-portrait profile (in blue/yellow), which lies as a silhouette on the glass plate. The second portrait shows the artist's head made of transparent resin, illuminated from the inside, slowly rotating around the vertical axis. The vertical rotation of the head and the horizontal circulation of the miniatures interpenetrate in the projection plane, creating a visualized model of flowing thoughts.",
