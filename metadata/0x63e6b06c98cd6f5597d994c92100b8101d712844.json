    "description": "Trading Cards/Poetry Anthology - Meta/Verse is a metafiction odyssey - charting a tale of love, loss, and 'The Liquid Switchboard' - whatever that may be...\n\nTogether, Meta/Verse weaves an intricate story across a series of 1/1 poems. Individually, each poem is also a trading card, deploying unique traits to encourage a playful reading of the poem.\n\nThe only poems without these 'levels' are special editions, which feature longer poetry, or microfiction.\n\nCATEGORIES\n\nBREVITY = How wasteful or expeditious is the language used to deliver the poem's story?\n\nDANGER = Did the poem explore challenging themes, or depict a situation with emotional/physical conflict? \n\nNARRATIVE = Is this a storytelling poem? How clearly articulated is the story? Some poems will be more abstract. Some will describe a moment in time. \n\nSONICS = How enjoyable is it to read? This is subjective - but generally relates to the experience of flow and rhythm in each piece.\n\nBOUNCE = Does this poem have a bouncy rhythm with lines of similar length and beat? Or is it more jagged in feel?\n\nGUT = Does it pack an emotional punch? \n\nThese categories are not meant to imply quality; instead, they encourage a re-viewing of the work and a consideration of qualities to explore in your own work.",
