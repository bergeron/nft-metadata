    "description": "I've always been fascinated with UFOs and sci-fi so drawing UFOs was a logical choice when I decided to start making art again this year. \n\nI like the idea of an alien visiting us for a vacation and arriving at night. I grew up with a field behind our house that bordered some woods and I've always liked that space where the environment changes from field to forest. ",
