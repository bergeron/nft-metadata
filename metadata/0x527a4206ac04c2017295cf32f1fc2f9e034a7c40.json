    "description": "The Painted Banners (for Adventurers) are 10,603 houses as depicted in the novel 'The Painter'. All elements of this collection are hand-painted and hand-drawn (on parchment) by the in-real-life version of the main character. \n\nBanners are the society and politics layer for the Lootverse and are narrative scaffolding for stories and worldbuilding. \n\nBanners will play a key role in future versions of our everyone-vs-everyone game, ‘Call the Banners’.\n\nLearn more at BannersNFT.com"
