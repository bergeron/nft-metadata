    "description": "The ultimate energy ‘Prakriti’ creates and recreates herself by herself & from herself eternally.\nShaping life, undoubtedly is an art & our own unfolding & awakening are our salvations and gifts to offer.\nThe essence of transition is that of faith & surrender & developing a realised spirit.\nPutting the whole world in perspective, I value those before us more & staying true to this path & process, constantly earning your stripes, revelation as always is an instant love affair.\nThese Inscapes embody this connection to the processes of creation.\nMy journey in the Arts has been a mystic cosmic experience, be it the evolution of my aesthetic or my discoveries dabbling in various mediums, or finding my way to collectors homes and personalities along the way.\nIntent & intuition have been graceful guides as always & the series has been a joy to create & now share.\n\n\nTitle: Inscape #1\n2160 px * 2880 px .Mp4 with sound.\n\nArt : Sarfaraz Laskari\nSound : Bahaish Kapoor",
