    "description": "I had been dreaming about taking pictures with my new drone. I drove to Rialto Beach in Washington State and set up the perfect spot to launch. As I was flying, I decided to fly it towards my friend carrying a rainbow umbrella.\n\nAs soon as the drone reached him, I started taking pictures of him holding the umbrella against the black sand beach as the background. The image was absolutely stunning and unique. It reminded me of how we each have our own uniqueness, even though we are all part of a larger group or society.\n\nOn that day, I learned an important lesson: no matter how similar we all look on the outside, each of us carries something that makes us truly unique from others. \n\nBe colorful â€¦ Be Prismatic.  \n\nArtist: Charles Martinez\n\nTitle: Be Prismatic\n\nEdition: OPEN\n\nLocation : Rialto Beach, WA\n\nYear Created : Sept 2021\n\nSize: 3296 x 4120\n\nGear : Mavic 2 Pro\n\nGenre : Aerial Photography\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising,  \ndisplay privately and in groups, including virtual  \ngalleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the  \nNFT, as long as creator is credited.
