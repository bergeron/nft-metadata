    "description": "The Artistic Muse is a collection of images inspired by the idea of the Muse, an elusive source of artistic inspiration that has been romanticised throughout history. \n\nDrawing from French Romanticism and the surrealist creative movement, these digital artworks capture the raw emotions and sentiments of virtual characters that do not exist in the physical world.\n\nThis project represents a fundamental shift in the way we create art, as it seeks to imbue AI images with the same depth of feeling and emotion that we typically reserve for human subjects.\n\nAs we enter 21st century, AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in our lives, and it is time for artists to turn their attention to this new frontier\n\nBy creating art that speaks to the emotions and feelings of these virtual entities, the Beyond Sex & Love project opens up new avenues of exploration and expand the boundaries of what is possible in the world of art\n\nThe Artistic Muse represents a bold step forward in this exciting new field",
