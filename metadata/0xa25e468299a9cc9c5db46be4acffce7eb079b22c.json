    "description": "Alif Laam Meem is an opportunity after which you believe in beliefs you questioned. The Qur'an is the sacred book of Muslims whose words are miracles, but what strange enchantment lies within the words once it says do not doubt this book, and the literal meaning with which it started to talk is still numinously preserved.",
