(MEDICAL EXAMINER) \nREPORT OF DEATH  SUBJECT: SECURITY OFFICER WELCH, B. \n\n  AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION  \n\nIt is my sad duty to officially pronounce Security Officer Benjamin Welch dead.  \n\nThe reports on the exact circumstances of his death are contradictory and beyond the scope of my task. While securing the G-38:7-10 phenomenon, the patient came into contact with an unknown substance that caused extensive damage to the entire body, especially the cerebrum area. The unknown organism most clearly resembles bacteria with viral behavior. Like bacteria, the organism infects other cells by osmosis, then mutates and multiplies agamogenetically… I can’t … What have we done to this poor soul. This is all our fault...\n\n  END OF AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION ",
