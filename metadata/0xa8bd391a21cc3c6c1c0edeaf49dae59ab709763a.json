    "description": "In his formative years, every artist one day experiences the fear of being unnoticed, or that his labors will be in vain, or that he is wasting his time simply, and that his art will become of no use to anyone. Or that he will simply one day go out of his way and give up.\n\nThis is my view of this feeling and this situation. Fear, anxiety, hope.",
