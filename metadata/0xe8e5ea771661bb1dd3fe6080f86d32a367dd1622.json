    "description": "    Donating your sincerity, your finances, your time somewhere, you should always ask yourself whether you are not becoming a participant in a low-grade competition, where someone else sets the rules and puts daring experiments. What kind of experiments can there be? Oh, the most different! For example, to find out whether the new design doctrine is able to compete on equal terms with the hegemony of the genre for thousands of years. Or - will the surrogate spaghetti belief be able to involve inveterate agnostics in religion.\n\n   And while the masses are making a crowd in an attempt to storm the Heavens, the inhabitants of the opposite pole prefer to stay in the shadows â€” they don't need at all for the dark mechanics of everything that is happening to receive any kind of illumination.",
