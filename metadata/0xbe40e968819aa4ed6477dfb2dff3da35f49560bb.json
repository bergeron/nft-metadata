    "description": "Technology has long been a tool with the sole purpose of complementing the function of humanity.  Yet as the boundaries of technological innovation are pushed, it has become a tool to supplement, and ultimately REPLACE, the human experience. This piece explores technology's contribution and significance to the human experience – with the depiction of a lone protagonist, isolated in a world where one’s humanity has been replaced by technology.",
