    "description": "It was during a walk at an artist-in-residency in the high desert of Arizona in 2011 where I discovered and excavated a rusty metal object. I've long been fascinated by trying to solve what something used to be while trying to discover what it longs to be now.  \nOnce I pulled this hunk of smashed metal from the earth I began the the rigorous task of removing as much soil, rocks and debris from the crevices and folds. Then I began stretching it like an accordion in order to remove the stubborn impacted soil and rocks that remained. it was during this process where I began to get a vision of the object it wanted to be.  \n I saw this rusted robotic like creature who had just enough energy left to pull itself along. With the aid of the castor it has had many glorious adventures but is ready for one more adventure to travelling through the blockchain. \nTo this day I'm still not 100% sure what it was but I do know for certain the mystery is half the allure! \nThe piece is made of: Found Objects, Steel, Wood, and Paint. \n\nDimensions(approx.): 15\" H x 18\" W x 17\" D",
