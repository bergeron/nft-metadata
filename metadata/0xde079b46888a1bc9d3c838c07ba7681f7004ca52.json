    "description": "Here's an 80 year old Apatani lady who have seen ages transforming, who saw ethinic himalayan civilization and now is the village's storyteller, favoutite granny of Ziro.\n\nThe Apatanis, one of the major ethnic groups of eastern Himalayas, have a distinct civilization with systematic land-use practices and rich traditional ecological knowledge of natural resources management and conservation, acquired over the centuries through informal experimentation. They are known for their colorful culture with various festivals, intricate handloom designs, skills in cane and bamboo crafts. This has made the Ziro Valley a living cultural landscape where humans and the environment have harmoniously existed together in a state of interdependence even through changing times, such coexistence being nurtured by the traditional customs and spiritual belief systems.\n\nLocation - Ziro, Arunachal Pradesh, India\nEdition - 1/1\nDimension - 5568 x 3712\nCamera - Nikon D500\nYear - 2018\nLicense - Extended Editorial",
