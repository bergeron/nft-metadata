    "description": "Back to work, the locksmith went, toiling away at the whims of the gods, but when their gaze drifted, the knowledge from his love led him to the key. His Love did not lay idle but worked at her new trade. The work was slow and difficult but her hands were steady and the steel was tempered.  \nOne day a great tempest raged as the gods discovered their locksmith was gone. He loved them, they made sure of that. He would not just leave. They accused each other, threatening the secrets they'd locked away. In their anguish, lament, and conspiracy, they did not notice the chain, hanging down from the heavens. Descending the chain, the Locksmith and his love climb down, slow and quiet, hand in hand. By the time they'd reached the ground, their love had grown larger than themselves. With the storm but a distant rumble, the pins clicked into place as the locksmith turned the key to their new life.",
