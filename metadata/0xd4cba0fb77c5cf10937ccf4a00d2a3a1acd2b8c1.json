    "description": "September 22nd, 2016. 2:49AM: Two hours earlier, I recline the front seat of my car, and set my alarm for 2:30am. A couple hours of sleep might be just enough time for the storm clouds to clear. As I awake, I can just barely make out the shot I've been obsessing over since I arrived in Iceland 24 hours earlier. All that's left is a short hike, a steady tripod and fifteen seconds of exposure to capture exactly why they call this the Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon. I'm now ready to make the long drive back to Keflavik to catch my flight back to reality.",
