    "description": "  I went for a thoughtful walk. And I was going to cross the street at the traffic lights. And then I saw the birds flying. When I looked up, I saw a lot of birds on the pole. I was very impressed by the harmonious posture of the birds. I shouldn't have missed this moment. And then I took this moment as a photo. And it remained to me a very meaningful photo. \n\n  And at that moment I realized that the bird cage is beautiful only when it is empty.\n",
