    "description": "This is the first piece in TSMGO series. \n\nThe COVID pandemic was an incredibly challenging time for performing arts, with many venues being completely shut down for months and artists facing a possible death of their livelihoods. Performing arts play an important role in challenging us to think about the society we live in; I wanted to highlight the importance of this in the way I know best - through photography.\n\nThis series was shot underground at Oxford Circus - London's busiest non-National Rail station - which is a short walk from Covent Garden, a central hub of the performing arts in the city. This was shot at 8pm on a Friday night - normally the busiest time of the week, yet the platform lay empty. I wanted to convey that, even with the doors of performance venues and theatres nationwide shut, the show must always go on - even if it's driven underground.\n\nThis piece will be made available to the collector as a custom print upon request.",
