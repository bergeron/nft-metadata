    "description": "\"Water child\" collection is a creative symbiosis of different arts. \nThat's the case when my team and I was creating the project all summer long. Many stages of preparation were passed. From the portrait filming on various films, to creation of the soundtrack and the filming in the water. \nThis collection is the meditative formula that everyone is looking for, because the most important thing in our lives is a peace of mind.\n\nPhotographer Victoria Khlebova\nPhotographer Vitaly Khlebov\nstyle Anna Bulenok\nmodel Lina Nhuien\nmusic Lucas Bird\n\ntime 00:08\nresolution 2160x3840\nvideo mp4",
