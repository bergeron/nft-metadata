    "description": "There are many beautiful sights in Okinawa that I see.\n\nThe pink glowing flower is bougainvillea.\nThe language of flowers is \"passion\" and \"I only see you.\n\nThe flower shining in golden color is Blumeria.\nThe language of flowers is \"Wishing happiness for your loved ones.\n\nThe crystal clear sea and the lush nature are vivid and unforgettably beautiful once seen.\n\nAs you grow older, you will see more and more of Okinawa's charms that you did not understand when you were a child.\n\nThe blue ribbon pattern worn by the girl is a mincer pattern that has been handed down from Okinawa's ancient history, and it represents the wish of the people of Okinawa for \"long-lasting happiness throughout the ages.\n\nShy and peace-loving Okinawans rarely say \"I love you\" in words, but they convey their romantic feelings through their culture and costumes.\n\nI would be happy if many people could understand the charm of Okinawa, which cannot be conveyed in words alone: nature, culture, and people.",
