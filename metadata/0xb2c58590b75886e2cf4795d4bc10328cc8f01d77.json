    "description": "This image was taken on Ua Pou in French Polynesia, minutes after myself and Chelsea Yamase set an intention for what we wanted the sunset to be like. We asked for epic light, clouds, inversions, rainbows - things we believed surreal to manifest.\n \nTo our biggest surprise, our manifestation started to happen almost magically! Minutes later I screamed  to turn around from facing the peaks (see other photos): a rainbow started to appear over the Pacific ocean and then nature decided to make it double rainbow!\n\nWatch the adventures behind this photo on YouTube here: https://pierretlambert.com/to/themarquesasbts (ep. 2)\n\nThe Marquesas is a group of 12 volcanic islands in French Polynesia sitting in the middle of the Pacific ocean. These islands feel like a lost Jurassic Park and inspired Melville to write Moby Dick after he ran away fearing he would get eaten by a local tribe...\n\nThis NFT gives access to one print (Either a 30″ x 20″ acrylic or a 45″ x 30\" Hahnemühle Fine Art Print).
