    "description": "NFT created from original found photograph from the artist's archive - Edition of 454\n\n“Bride,” is TR Ericsson’s first digital exhibition and presents a singular work in correspondence to his exhibition “Tom & Sue” at Harlan Levey Projects. For over two decades, Ericsson has been working from an extensive personal archive that documents four generations of family life in the American midwest. This small 8 x 10 inch snapshot is the source of several artworks, which have been exhibited at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, The Cleveland Museum of Art and the Everson Museum of Art and will continue to play a role in his future practice.\nThe NFT is created from an original found photograph of Susan B. Robinson (1968). In Ericsson's words: \"A bridal portrait taken of my mother in 1968 to commemorate her first marriage. A few months later they were divorced. She never talked about it. I recorded an interview with her over the phone toward the end of her life and asked her about him. Unusual for her she demurred, said: she’d rather not talk about it, adding only, “he was weird”.” \n\nThe number of the edition references the 454 miles distance between the artist and his mother at the time of her death (NY  - Ohio), the price of  $213.29 USD was her final remaining bank balance before an electric bill and a carton of cigarettes. \n",
