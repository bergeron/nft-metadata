    "description": "\"Astronaut looked around in surprise. There was a forest around. Dark, gloomy and ancient. Massive trees stretched upwards, partially covering the sky above the smooth surface of a perfectly round lake with their twisted branches - just like in scary children's fairy tales.\nThe air in this forest was completely normal. It smelled of a mixture of pine needles and slightly musty flowering water.\"\nThis is just a small part of a big story.",
