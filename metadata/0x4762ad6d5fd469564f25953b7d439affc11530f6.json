    "description": "I am interests in woman's topic in general, and the whole connotation that it involvement. Many times are portraits, but other I am only interested in the human complete figure. \nThese paintings series, I intermingle with visual textures, forming human figures. I like the abstract paintings, one with certain brushstrokes of details.  I am worth myself of textures, brushstrokes, impressions and prints to create icons or symbols that always affect the person, since are surrounded of them throughout our life.\nIn the series '' REFLECTIONS '' it interests me the conceptual of the idea, and the support and the alone technique they are a tool in function of the concept. I look for the reflection and meditation of us through the mirrors or of our own conscience. It is the interior question of the own life and their daily situations. It is the society that oppresses us and it excludes us, until the point that locks us in a vicious circle of which is very difficult the escape.\n",
