    "description": "I wrote this song in one sitting. I recorded the demo in the bathroom while my kids were playing and running around the house. They turned my couch upside down and were using it as a slide. As I recorded the demo on my phone, their voices would come in and out at perfect times. I ended up chopping up a lot of those moments and using them on the final version. As the second verse starts on the demo my son Miles asks, “Can we do that again?”, so I used his vocal and dropped it in the same place on the final version. I love the demo of this song so much too. There’s a lot of magic in it and I want to put it out one day.",
