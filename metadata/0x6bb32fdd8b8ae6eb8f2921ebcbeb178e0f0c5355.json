    "description": "I wanted the first photo of the collection to be from the back of the street. \n\nThis is Istanbul, one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the world. And Eminönü is a neighborhood that everyone who comes to this city must pass through. Too crowded.\n\nThe things that make these children happy in those crowds are the little things like the red candy paper just under the ladder step. \nYes.. This is the only thing we realize when we meet them.. Or what we prefer to notice... \n\nKids were big enough to notice me and laugh after I took the photo :))\n\nLet life flow in the direction you want guys...\n\n\n23/02/2019\nEminonu / ISTANBUL",
