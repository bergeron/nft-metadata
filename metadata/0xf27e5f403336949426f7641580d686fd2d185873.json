    "description": "shot in downtown London, Ontario. this book store has been around for the last 20+ years, and was one of the last true sanctuaries of the city. you could get lost in here for hours, finding anything and everything to read or learn about. it was a place that i can remember from my childhood up until recently. unfortunately they closed last year. it's a shame as it truly felt like losing a place that didn't care about anything that was going on in the outside world; all that mattered was the seemingly endless piles of books to dig in to. i still walk by their old store when coming downtown, not really sure why but it's reassuring to return to a simpler time.",
