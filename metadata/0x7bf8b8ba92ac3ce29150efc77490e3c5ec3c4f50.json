    "description": "Tell me you're in Italy, without telling me you're in Italy üçù\n\nI am grateful to have this lunch break while working on the terrace and enjoying rays of sunlight shining through the clouds. The last few days in Berlin -before coming here for a christmas family visit- have been icy and dark.\n\nFresh air and the shades of green are filling up my soul with energy for the rest of the winter.  The pasta cooked in front of me is perfect: spicy and \"al dente\". \n\n",
