    "description": "An Agent holding her helmet and facing a mirror. \nShe is in shock from seeing herself for the first time.  \nAnother agent spots her or is spying on her.  \nEager to report her to the higher powers...\n\nThe mirror is symbolic of looking into oneself and understanding oneself. Introspection or self reflection is frowned upon in the Corinthian state. It is the seed of rebellion.\n\nOnly the \"Powers that be\" are allowed to look into the mirror.  \nThey are the most enlightened souls because of this. \nThey keep other people away from that knowledge  \nby forbidding mirrors or anything that can lead to  \nthe development of an ego, intellect or self awareness.  \nAnd that's how they maintain and monopolize power.\n\nAnother agent on the right behind the wall has spotted her  \nand will obviously inform on her to the Higher Ups.\n\nOriginal Sin is a reference to the first sin by Adam and Eve.",
