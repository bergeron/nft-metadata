    "description": "In collaboration with Alice Meunier, biologist.\n\nHas the dispersion of information superseded human consciousness at the center of our evolution? \n\nExploring this theory, i thought interesting to wonder which biological mechanism snap our choices and decisions process.\n\n{Centriole} is a plunge into another dimension. A bottomless space where one travels between constellations of centrioles. Each cell is at a different stage of its metamorphosis. Some progress through a slow and barely visible process, while others have reached a quick, intense and explosive phase. \nLike the galaxies, some are contracting, others are expanding. \n\nBy exploring the cell, we penetrate into our own mysteries. \n\nBiological generative art lives within us: centrioles are scattered, within the cell, surrounding the nucleus that shelters its DNA. Around a world, its world, our world. \n\nReality is not interpreted, it is visualized: a collective motion brimming with distinction and dynamism. The centrioles flow like pixelated stars orchestrated in time and space. Their singularities arise. The invisible is unveiled, alive.\n\nSpining disk videomicroscopy\n\nA pixel is 2/10000 of millimeters in our brain.\nOne second represents 80mn of the cell dynamics\n\nSound by Agoria.\nFilm mp4 based on works by Alice Meunier, research director, IBENS, CNRS.",
