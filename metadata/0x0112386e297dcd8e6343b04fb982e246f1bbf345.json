    "name": "Golden Cat",
    "description": "\nBlue blood? Not quite...she is just a cat, \nThat dragged the truth out in the mud. \nShe plays in silver but she feels,\nSome golden ants under her skin. \nShe scratches layers and bleeds copper, \nSome games, some sins, she eats for supper. \nShe moves, she’s liquid, but you see,\nThe lips are full, the smile so thin. \nDry earth, some smoke, play with a shadow\nIt hides or seeks, smells fish, won’t bother,\nShe saves her energy for dance,  \nFixed by her eyes, gets so intense,  \nThe pray will never stand a chance. \nIf you deny her deep emotion, \nHer broken arms will serve devotion \nTo gods invented in a dream \nShe licks her wounds, she screms her hymn.\n\n - Acrylic on canvas 50/70 cm \nThe physical piece was painted in 2017 and it was the first painting I ever sold in crypto while being involved in one of the first crypto art communities, “Slothicorn”. \nIt is now owned by @stellabelle and I thought it was just fitting for this one to be my first minted NFT.\nPhotography 1103/1492 px\n\n\n",
