    "description": "My Mistress' Eyes Are Nothing Like The Sun\nBy William Shakespeare\n\nMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun\nCoral is far more red than her lips' red\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head\nI have seen roses damasked, red and white\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound\nI grant I never saw a goddess go\nMy mistress when she walks treads on the ground\nAnd yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare\nAs any she belied with false compare.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe",
