    "description": "Does this art have Utility? Yes. \n\nA macuahuitl ([maːˈkʷawit͡ɬ]) is a weapon, a wooden club with several embedded obsidian blades. The name is derived from the Nahuatl language and means \"hand-wood\". Its sides are embedded with prismatic blades traditionally made from obsidian. \n-\nThis is whatever you want it to be. It has endless utility. You can use it to scratch your head, to lay the smack down, as a cheese board, or even as art to hang on your wall. \n-\nThe NFT itself comes with the original art piece shipped to you anywhere in the world, as well as a 3D scanned model to bring into your metaverses to add even more utility. \n\n",
