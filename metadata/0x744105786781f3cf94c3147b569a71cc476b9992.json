    "description": "A gritty, hardened survivor, Daryl Dixon has embraced his new family in the post-apocalypse. Daryl has shone as a light to others while serving as an expert marksman and a hunter. Transformed from a gruff lone wolf into a family member, he retains a rough exterior to defend those he loves. From a growling biker to a soldier, Daryl has touched the lives of many. While still a man of few words, Dixon now stands for whatâ€™s right, even if it means sacrifice. Daryl rides into the Metaverse in the form of this hand-sculpted 3D artifact. Crafted with care and expertise by designers at Orange Comet, this collectible breathes new life into the character. This 3D digital likeness is a masterfully sculpted, true high-value collectible.",
