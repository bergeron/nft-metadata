    "description": "I have dreams of our red car,\nand the downpour that turned into drizzle that night.\nThe smell of the rain; and the vibrant lights;\nblurred by your laughter\nand the drops kissing the windshield all night.\n\nOur song played a smile, and the streets glowed for a while,\nWe caught glimpses of curious eyes,\nbut we didn't stop, we just drove by...\n\nDETAILS: \nThe vintage car with venetian blinds is COMPLETELY FINGER PAINTED. Each and every stroke leads to the story.\nOriginal Artwork\nsize: 30*40 inches\nmedium: Oils",
