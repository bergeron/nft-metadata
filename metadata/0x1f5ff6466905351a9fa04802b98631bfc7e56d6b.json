    "description": "Despair; the loss of hope for the future, is one of the most difficult experiences in one's life, and it affects everyone eventually. When you're drowning in despair, even the most simple task seems impossible. Despair can hit you out of nowhere, or it can creep up on you gradually. You had to fight your vicious demons to regain your footing. If you can effectively acknowledge and manage your despair, you can reach even greater heights. It teaches you how to fly with broken wings. Despair increases empathy for the suffering of others. Instead of pushing your despair away, honor it so that you can gain some control over it.",
