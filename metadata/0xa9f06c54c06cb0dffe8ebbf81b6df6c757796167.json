    "description": "Hurricane is a perfect rendition of the sound we always envisioned for Koastle. It started with a DM after I (Andy) found Talia Rose on my Discover Weekly Spotify playlist while she had only 1,000 monthly listeners. Fun fact is that Talia actually quit music around the time I reached out, she hadn't made any new music for about a year but was coincidentally visiting LA to visit her girlfriend who was in the area at the time. We had one day to work as the next day she was driving to Vegas, she is originally from Australia so after a red eye flight for almost 16 hours she showed up to our apartment, we loaded her up with RedBull and this song was the result. We're so proud of this record, we're so proud of Talia for staying caffeinated long enough to write and cut this song and now it has become on of our favorite releases to date :)",
