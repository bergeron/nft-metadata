    "description": "We identify the color red with vibrating negative emotions and danger while the color yellow reflects on safety and comfort - this duality balances throughout the whole picture. We expose ourselves to pain and harm again and again because we are unable to learn from our wounds – we won’t realize that our deepest and darkest wounds are capable of lifting us up to the sky until we learn and heal from them.",
