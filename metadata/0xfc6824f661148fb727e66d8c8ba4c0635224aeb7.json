    "description": "Structural Integrity: Butterfly in the Machine is part of a series of six ghost tapestries Camille Sofia Rivera created in Puerto Rico in 2021. She sees the ghost as a symbol for the unification of presence and absence--a relevant theme in digital art. For this NFT, the artist has freed the ghost from its tapestry, so that it can haunt the metaverse. The GIF and tapestry are tied together as a pair: one is the real ghost, and the other, its mythological portrayal.\n",
