    "name": "Riding High N' Sitting Low",
    "description": "Riding high and sitting low are terms used to describe the position of a vehicle's suspension.\n\nRiding high refers to a vehicle that has a high ground clearance, which means there is a significant distance between the bottom of the vehicle and the ground. This can be due to a number of factors, including the type of vehicle (such as a truck or SUV), the size of the tires, or the suspension setup. A vehicle that is riding high may have a higher center of gravity and may be more prone to tipping or rolling over in sharp turns.\n\nSitting low, on the other hand, refers to a vehicle that has a low ground clearance. This means that the bottom of the vehicle is close to the ground and there is less distance between the vehicle and the ground. Low-riding vehicles may have a lower center of gravity, which can make them more stable and easier to handle at high speeds. However, they may also be more prone to damage from obstacles on the road or from scraping the ground when driving over rough terr",
