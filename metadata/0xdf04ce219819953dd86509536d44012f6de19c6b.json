    "description": "First official NFT minted by the artist. \nTo stretch and deepen your perception.\n\nThe static 3D shape is melting without traces \nwhile coming onto the screen from its depths. \nTherefore the face it has on the screen is \nappearing to morph, but what we are really \nexperiencing are next frames consisting \nof a new shape represented by each \ncoming frame. The screen is electrifying \nso the following colors are glowing on touch. \n\nYou can either focus on the shape coming \nfrom the depths, sequenced colors, the pulse \nof the light along with the music, follow one \nreshaping spot, or trying to experience \nall the moves as a whole.\n\nIt is part of a whole new collection of NFTs \nconsisting of morphing, trippy tunnels.\n\nThe longer you look the more you see. \nThe NFT version is a much longer piece \nallowing you to experience things continuously. \nNext pieces will be even more continuous and \nperfectly looped without need to experience \nbeginning and end.\n",
