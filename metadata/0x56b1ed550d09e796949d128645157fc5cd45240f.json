    "description": "                 I strongly advise you to take a closer look at two works - Red Elephant and Red Elephant 101 days gone War, both works are exhibited on both OpenSea and Foundation.\n\n        Red Elephant 101 days gone War - June 4, 2022 on the 111th day of the war! Digital version. And she directly points to what she is. If someone read the fable of I. A. Krylov “Curious”, they will understand what I mean. It is about the world in which I now live and is no less symbolic than “Russian warship, fuck you!”.\n\n  There are also other works, but they are of a different genre and from other collections and projects. The future that I wrote about a couple of months ago has arrived. And already launched projects PAINTED Masks (renamed PAINted N.A.Z.); Finger's Family by N.A.Z.; BOMBZzzzz by N.A.Z.; and of course LOVE You Ukraine\nI would be very grateful to everyone who subscribes to me in the social. networks.\n\nTwitter @AlphaQuestion  Telegram @AlphaQuestion  Instagram Nikolai Zinchenko ",
