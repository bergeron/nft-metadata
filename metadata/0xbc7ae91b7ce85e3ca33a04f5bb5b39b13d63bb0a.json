    "description": "Life is fragile and we never know when it will come to an end, so it's important to make the most of the time we have and appreciate the moments we have with loved ones. Despite the fact that death is a natural part of life, it can be difficult to accept and cope with, especially when it comes suddenly or unexpectedly. So it's important to be mindful of our own mortality and try to live life to the fullest.",
