    "description": "When I was a kid, I really dreamt about this gameboy. I saw it on the counter or in the hands of children I knew. Time has passed, my childhood is gone, but I still love this handheld console like millions of others. I decided to make it OE so that everyone who saw it could buy it and keep it in their collection to remember their childhood, youth, and best feelings.\n\nAnimated Series \n",
