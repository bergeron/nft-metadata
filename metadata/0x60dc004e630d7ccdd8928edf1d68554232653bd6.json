    "description": "At sea, and inside my heart, there is a storm brewing. As I leave the dock, I let go of all that I have been holding on to. It has been a desolate journey through uncharted emotions for me. Now I am a reluctant passenger rather than a captain. In the midst of steel that undergoes changes, it is hard to stay steady, perhaps because I am also going through changes I cannot suppress. During such a challenging journey, my conviction is tested, and my resolve is reinforced. My hope is that I will soon reach land and find some clarity.",
