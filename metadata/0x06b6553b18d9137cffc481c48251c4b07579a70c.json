    "description": "What’s up, these are the kooks. Born and raised in El Porto, they’ve been surfing the world-famous break Shit Pipe since grom days. These guys have been taking a beating in the shore pound since they can remember so, as you can imagine, they know how to take a hit. Watching their home break get taken over by the steady stream of pollution is pissing the kooks off, and the recent take over by the greedy Lizard Queen has pushed it all to a boiling point. She’s taken her power from the righteous King Kook and is polluting the water with her money-hungry offshore drilling. Ready to take their beach, the kooks know the only way to save their wave is to restore power to King Kook, the question is how.",
