    "description": "You will be disappointed by the people around you, but this is a new beginning  \nThe ground is cold  \nBut this warm blood is in your body  \nThat gives you the courage to continue and you move  \nYou will see many birds on your way  \nwho stare at you with their beautiful eyes  \nBut what do they think about you?  \nYou hug one of them  \nAnd you want it to stay with you  \nBut it puts you to sleep with all his beauty and tells you:  \nDo not pollute my beauty  \nDon't take my wings  \nI am not your type  \nI will never come down from my height  \npass me by  \nAnd the roof of the world will fall for you  \nAnd you shout loudly:  \nSo what is beautiful in this world so that I can walk on this cold ground?  \nWhile flying in the sky, it tells you:  \nOnly you are beautiful  \nand live for yourself.",
