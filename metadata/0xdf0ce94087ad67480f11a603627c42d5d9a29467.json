    "name": "Will you Choose Freedom?",
    "description": "Freedom is defined as liberty of conscience, thought, feeling and opinion, as“liberty of tastes and pursuits,doing as we like … without impediment from our fellow creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them.” \n Even if just one person held a particular opinion while everyone else in the world held the opposite, there would be no justification in silencing that one voice. For me,one of the main ingredients of social progress is freedom from the traditions and customs imposed by others, which restricts the cultivation of individuality, which in turn “is one of the leading essentials of well-being.” Individual liberty is vital, not just for the sake of the individual, but for the sake of human progress. Without it there will be no originality or genius, no new discoveries or innovation. Civilisation cannot advance without a degree of individual freedom which encourages spontaneous expression, and the  development of new thougths and ideas unconstrained by the patterns of the past.",
