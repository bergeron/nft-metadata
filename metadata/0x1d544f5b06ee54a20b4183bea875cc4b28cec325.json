    "description": "A thousand-year-old arched Medieval doorway opens to the present-day churning waters of the Wild Atlantic Ocean, bridging the centuries while capturing the ever-evolving nature of time and the power of tides.\n\nBoth the portal and the ocean are imbued with deep history in this composite image/video.\n\nThe doorway and stone walls are from Ireland's historic Rock of Cashel National Monument, seat of Irish Royalty and site of gruesome battles more than 1,000 years ago in County Tipperary.\n\nThis section of the Atlantic Ocean on Ireland's rugged West Coast of County Clare became the grave of thousands of sailors when many ships of the Spanish Armada went on the rocks and sank in 1,588.\n\nThough many lives were lost in both epochs, there remains a poignant beauty, a soulful presence.\n\nThis piece is part of the \"Tides of Time\" Collection by Irish Artist James A. Truett.\n\nArtist: James A.
