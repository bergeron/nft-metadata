    "description": "Crater Lake National Park is probably my favorite wintertime location to visit.  I've made many trips there during the quiet and bitterly cold season to seek solitude and witness the most beautiful season there.  This image of first light washing across the snow was special because I shared the moment with my father-in-law as the lake below remained still in nearly perfect reflection.  This photo was taken a mere 20 feet away from where we spent the night.",
