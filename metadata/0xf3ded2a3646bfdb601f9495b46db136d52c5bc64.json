    "description": "It is an abstract representation of the duality of Light and Darkness, Good and Evil. Inspired by the dark and light side of the force, it is a story about that eternal dance between light and darkness, seducing each other, intertwining with each other. and fight to dominate each other. \n\nComposed of two photographs whose strokes rhyme together between aggressive and subtle movements seeking the contour. The color palette in shades of black, gray and bright red expressed on the dark side, along with white and electric blue expressed on the light side.",
