    "description": "A young woman walks along the bay in Baracoa, Cuba, on 19 November 2003. \n\nMy story as a photographer is a long one. My first love was street photography and photojournalism. Between 2001 and 2003, I made several trips to Cuba, armed with only a Leica camera, a 35mm lens, and lots of Tri-X film. This collection is an archive of that work. As I get older, I've been thinking about my legacy and history, and I am minting this work because it was important to my development as an artist, and because I want it to be preserved forever on the blockchain.",
