    "description": "My creation process consists of superimposing different images using algorithms close to the AI that create a recomposition strategy as human memory could do. Human memory does not operate like a camera, it distorts, confuses, agglomerates, mixes and deforms. It is for me to go beyond the automations of the AI to find a new vision through a process of emergence. This consists in observing how photographic shooting, image fusion algorithms bring back to art. ",
