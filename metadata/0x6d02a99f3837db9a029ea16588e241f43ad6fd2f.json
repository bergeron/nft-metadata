    "description": "Digital Photography and AI\n\nLa Mort Watches is the first in a series that explores the manifestation of omnipresent anguish; fury and impotence trapped equally.  Joy and torment intertwined yet holding no meaning. A ghastly parody of being always watched, always threatened yet never touched.\n\nOriginal pictures of the artist head and face are blended with AI generated images. Prompts for the images come from extended conversations with Text to Text AI. Images, original, AI generated and blended, are then folded back onto each other; a continuous process of blending and selecting until the vision has been achieved.",
