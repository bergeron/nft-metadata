    "description": "Every Halloween, Deadfellaz ‘infects’ the work of other artists, producing a unique body of collaborative work that pays tribute to the ethos of Web3, Deadfellaz, and the incredible talent found in the space. Ledger collaborated with artist @KillerAcid, whose Cali-punk-rock approach to cartoon psychedelia was the perfect match to riff off the vibe of the underworld Horde.\n\nBased in Santa Cruz, CA, Killer Acid has been creating art and art products for over 25 years. He’s collaborated with companies including Adult Swim, High Times, Meow Wolf, Polaroid, Santa Cruz Skateboards, and VICE. Killer Acid’s style is a blend of head shop and punk rock, hearkening back to his tumultuous and technicolor coming-of-age in New York City.",
