    "description": "One of my life’s biggest fear is to leave this world without making a mark. As an individual, the concept of a legacy has haunted me for many years. I often wonder to myself, if I were to leave the world today, have I really done enough to touch someone’s heart, to inspire curiosity and imagination in their minds, to change their lives  for the better?\n\nTravel and photography have taught me that regardless of where we find ourselves in the world it is very easy to see the chaos and ugliness, but you could also choose to see the beauty.\n\nMyself in the Narrative is a series dedicated to bringing out those moments. To seeing beyond the dimensions of reality and fully pay homage to both the natural and human-made wonders around the world that inspired my journey as an artist. Each piece incorporates not only my photography but also as the title suggests, putting myself back in the narrative.\n\n\nPart I - Agra, India - December 2019\n\nSukrit Srisakulchawla",
