    "description": "1/1\nTIF\n9120 x 12000 px, 300 dpi\n\nWhere Did Macy Go? consists of a series reports of Macy’s encounter with the epidemic, life during the quarantine, his death and revival. The work discusses the collapse of old community structures, the emergence of a new community after decollectivization, Confucian obedience vs. social obedience, as well as the new tele-republic of home, “mask politics” and social justice under the pandemic. The work is a response to this era of volatility, complexity and confusion. \n\nThis chapter presents the empty Fangcang hospital (mobile field hospital) that Macy received treatment after he contracted COVID-19. However, when Macy tried to renew his new immunity plan in order to continue living in the new “Tele-community of home”, he was rejected by the official because his skin looked a bit yellow. Macy gave up all hope on the new system and disappeared.",
