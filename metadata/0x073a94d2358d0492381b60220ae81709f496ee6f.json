    "description": "Summers are so hot in Istanbul. Even though the Marmara Sea surrounds the city, not everyone can enjoy it equally - the beaches are reserved mostly for the rich people. Nevertheless, the younglings do not mind the legal restrictions and turn the sea into a playground for themselves. \n\nUnderprivileged kids, especially those of immigrants, Romani people, and seasonal workers from the small villages of Anatolia come to the Galata Bridge and jump into the sea without care. Harsh living conditions cannot stand in the way of having a good time.\n\nExhibited at GregoArt 2021, in Saint Gr√©goire, France.\n\nPhotographer: Masis Usenmez\n\nBio: EFIAP honored, award-winning Armenian origin Turkish street and documentary photographer based in France.\n\nEditions: 15/15  \nMinted with Manifold Smart Contract  \nLicense: Extended Editorial\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
