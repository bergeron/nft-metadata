    "description": "One of the biggest myths in the history of humankind is that the Mondays are boring and lazy, people hate Mondays for nonsense reasons and they feel that the weekend is way too short, but let me blow your mind, the truth is that the Mondays are just like any other day of the the week. Its all in our mind. If we are willing to change our perspective and look at Mondays with a positive attitude, we can definitely change the way we feel about it.",
