    "description": "The last step is the first image from the \"In Silence\" series. \nThis image was taken in Istanbul in 2019, just a few months before the Covid epidemic in the world.\n\nThe sound behind this image is the sound of the Bosphorus waves, seagulls and the whistles of ships. Sounds that can still be heard in the silence of the photo.\n---\n\nphoto details:\nCanon 5D mark III - 24/70 @70 mm - F/4 - 1/320 s - ISO 100",
