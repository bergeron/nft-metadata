    "description": "DreaMTime by Nuwan Shilpa Hennayake\n\nI took a sip of the sacred brew and sat in front of a large window gazing into the sunset, absorbed in the contemplation of my daily escapades.\n\nAt this moment, in coincidence or synchronicity, I do not know, I heard a gecko chirping as it walked into my field of view, creating a silhouette against the glowing orb of the setting sun. \n\nI felt a strange sensation. \n\nFractal-esque patterns began to emerge in my visual field, delicate intricacies weaved through my thoughts, the land, my perceptions, the sky, blended and braided through all that is past and all that is to come. \n\nThat's when I knew I had arrived! ; the in-between dimension of the eternal present. \n\n21600 x 7200 | 300dpi | .jpg",
