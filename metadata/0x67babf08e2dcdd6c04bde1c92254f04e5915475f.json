    "description": "“All Gold Spaceship” is the first ever angelbaby single release to be chosen by the Humies in “The Spot.” \r\n\r\n By the year 3045, the Xani Republic have closed the metaverse and the Hume Collective is forced into hiding. It became an honor to get to make decisions together and they learned that influencing each other gave everyone a voice. As Angelbaby said “it saved us in our darkest moments.” \r\n\r\n This limited edition collection of 300 represents an entirely new way of releasing music where Hume Genesis holders have the power to choose angelbaby's single. \r\n\r\n we are hume. we are many. \r\n\r\n wearehume.com",
