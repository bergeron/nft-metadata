    "description": "By the late 1800’s baseball was on its way to becoming America’s Pastime. Goodwin Tobacco (owner of Old Judge and Gypsy Queen cigarettes) created what has become known as the first official\nbaseball card set (the N167 set). The N172 Old Judge set had over 550 cards. This NFT collection pays homage to these early players and collectables, by adding modern graphics, created by Manuel Pardo, and by being the first to enshrine this one of a kind collection on the blockchain - in perpetuity.\n\nArtists\nBillie Halliday\nManuel Pardo\n",
