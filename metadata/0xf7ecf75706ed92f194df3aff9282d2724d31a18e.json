    "description": "\nClose to Sossusvlei, Deadvlei is a clay pan characterized by dark, dead camel thorn trees contrasted against the white floor. \n\nThe pan was formed when the Tsauchab River flooded, a large amount of water allowed trees to grow from camel thorn.\n\nThe climate changed and the sand dunes prevented the river from reaching the area. The trees are about 900 years old, but they did not decompose due to the dry climate.\n────────────────────────\nDigital 2D illustration, \n\n6000x 5000px, JPEG\n\n",
