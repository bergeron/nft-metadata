Neapolitan Mastiff.\n\nIf I could place a crown upon the head of every dog in the world, I would.\n\nTheir undying loyalty to their family is to be admired. \n\nMy career in creating art with dogs began in 2003. The ‘Royal Dog’ portraits serve as a way to honor these incredible animals – both for their regal stature and the loyalty that is so deeply ingrained inside of them.",
