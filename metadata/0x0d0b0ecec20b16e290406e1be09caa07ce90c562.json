    "description": "The power of horses üêé , a sight to behold,\nTheir strength and might, a story untold,‚Ä®\nWith manes that flow like a river of gold,‚Ä®\nAnd eyes that gleam, wild and bold.\n\nThey run through fields, free and unbridled,\n‚Ä®Their hooves pounding, earth trembles unbridled,‚Ä®Their spirit unbroken, wild and wild,\n‚Ä®And in their presence, we are beguiled.\n\nTheir loyalty, a bond unbreakable,‚Ä®\nTheir courage, unshakable and unbreakable,\n‚Ä®Their beauty, a sight unforgettable,\n‚Ä®As they carry us through lands untouchable.\n\nFor in the power of horses, we see our own,‚Ä®\nA wild spirit that cannot be owned,‚Ä®\nA connection that is deeply sewn,‚Ä®\nAnd in their presence, we feel truly grown.\n\nSo let us honor these magnificent beasts,\n‚Ä®And celebrate their power and feats,‚Ä®\nFor in their grace and strength, we find our own,‚Ä®\nAnd together, we roam free and alone.",
