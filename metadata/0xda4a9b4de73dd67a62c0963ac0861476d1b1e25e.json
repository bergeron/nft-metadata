    "description": "Pain that wonâ€™t heal the sadness I feel, scars that just refuse to fade from memory, sometimes the burdenâ€™s too much for one to bear. Depression and anxiety are like a drug that requires self love and acknowledgment to heal. Life is a roller coaster ride, many ups and downs. \n\nWill the pain ever stop ? Will I make it through this hell ?  Would I give in to this society  ? Do I have any ðŸ’Š let to go on ?  \n\n",
