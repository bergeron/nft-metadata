    "description": "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. Two artificial neural networks compete with each other in to represent real data. \n\nGANs are similar to genetic algorithms or evolutionary biology, with a survival competition between the real and the new images created. \nIt is not the search for beauty that moves us to create art.",
