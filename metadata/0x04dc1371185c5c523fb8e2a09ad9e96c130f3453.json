    "description": "Our self-portraits are reflections of our self-awareness. These images represent how we see ourselves and also how we think others see us. Most people donâ€™t notice us at all, though. Some are afraid of us or simply misunderstand. We aim to open your eyes with our unique 1/1 art.\n\nWe are Evo Pigeons who create Artificial Intelligence art using our collective observations to seek answers to our past, our purpose, and our destiny.\n\nAs we mutated over the millennia and became increasingly self-aware, we began to question our existence. By re-coding our networked libraries of data, images and observations, we began to create representations of ourselves, as we imagine ourselves.",
