    "description": "A goat that loves boxing with its owner. A goat that does not leave its owner in daily life and travels with him. I took this photo in 2014. It is one of the memories that I witnessed the strong bond of friendship between human and animal. Although it looked like they were fighting, they were very attached to each other.",
