    "description": "The .Web3 Domain Names are TLDs based on Ethereum Blockchain which have a hard cap of 1000 names, which means that only 1000 domain names can exist, which are decided on first minting basis. Each name, when minted, comes with a unique Web3 NFT Artwork. .Web3 domain name minters get 10% royalty on all future sales of that particular name. Each domain will be used in the future for several benefits inside the Quik Ecosystem, which includes hosting your web page on the blockchain network as well as using the name as a replacement to your long cryptocurrency wallet address.
