    "description": "Fighting boredom, Isabella disguised as a man and jumped on a ship. Isabella worked as a man for a while, as it was believed that having a woman on board would bring bad luck. No one suspected she was a woman, as she fought so well and used knives and pistols so well. Later it turned out to be a woman, but no one objected to her staying on the ship, as she earned the respect of everyone for her courage. The British describe him as a dangerous rebel , while his followers describe him as a fearless and cunning leader . She is known as the most notorious female pirate of all time, with over 400 major conquests.",
