    "description": "Seven circles expand. At the points they overlap, new circles are born. As those expand even more circles are born.  The result is a chain reaction captured here in a frozen moment.\n\nThis image is taken from frame 60 of an animation I created using NodeBox, a visual language for generative art that uses wires (nodes and links) instead of words.  The network constructed to create this image required over 3800 nodes and 5300 links.\n\nJPEG | 10800 x 7200\n\nArtist - John Cartan\n\nLicense - Extended Editorial\nPrivate Display / Personal Non-Commercial Use.
