This art-driven project focuses on connecting fans of independent animation with a community treasury that gets to vote on and act as a producer in every part of the showâ€™s creative process. By owning one of the 5,500 uniquely generated Ziggys, you are participating in the full production of animated television and we are excited for you to join us.",
