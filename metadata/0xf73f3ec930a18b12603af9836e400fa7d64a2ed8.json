    "description": "My first ever Aurora Borealis chase led me to Yellowknife Canada which is touted as the best place in the world to see the Northern Lights given its proximity to the Arctic Circle and stable weather. Yellowknife is known for its beautiful vast landscape with a multitude of lakes, perfect for summer aurora season. On the very first night, I made my way up the Ingraham Trail out to Cameron Falls to try my luck. I hiked out after sunset with enough ambient light to easily navigate to the falls. As I descended down to the base of the falls and took my first glance up, the green Aurora glow was already shining brightly against the blue twilight sky. With my heart racing, I quickly setup my camera to run a time-lapse as the lights danced over the falls. As the sky grew darker, the Northern Lights intensified and lit up the entire landscape in an eerie green glow. Being able to witness natureâ€™s lights in such a magical environment over a rushing waterfall was such a surreal experience and one that I will never forget. First collector will receive a choice of one photographic still from this time-lapse.",
