    "description": "🤖 « Ｂｅｎｄｅｒ ｔｈｅ  Ｆｒｏｇ » 🐸\n\n\n🍺 In a parallel universe lives Pepe’s alter ego: Bender, a green robot with bulging eyes, who always drinks beer. When Bender goes to the toilet to pee, he likes to pull down his pants to the ankles. And when his friends asks him why he pees in that way, he just answers them: “Feels good, man.”\n\n\n✏ Made by mixed media, using Faber-Castell Art & Graphic colored pencils and Sakura Pigma Micron archival ink pens on 80gr/m² paper. The drawing dimensions are 12x12cm. Afterwards, scanned & digitally edited.\n\n\n💲 After purchasing, you will have a high-quality file of the work for printing (Contact by twitter: @naroagutierrez).\n\n",
