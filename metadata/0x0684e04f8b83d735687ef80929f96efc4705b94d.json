    "description": "It all started in my early childhood when I spotted a black cat in the middle of a playground. I hurled a small stone to shoo it away, partly out of fear. The cat fled, and as I reached the spot where the feline was seated, I found a two Rupee coin. Extremely thrilled and happy with my newfound treasure, I bought myself a bar of chocolate. The next day, the same cat was nowhere to be found. I, however, got fixated on the idea that if you spot a black cat, it will definitely bring you some good luck. Many years later, I was running extremely late for a flight, when a black cat crossed my path as I rode on the pillion. Without a doubt, I felt assured that good luck was to follow. To my disbelief, the repercussions of reaching late had me miss the flight and experience a very difficult afternoon. An acquaintance later highlighted that I shouldn't have let the feline cross the road. It struck me then. How could a creature hold a bad reputation for crossing the road? ",
