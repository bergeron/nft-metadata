    "description": "FEATHERWEIGHT is a series of nude self-portraits. It began as an exercise in healing from the trauma of being physically assaulted. Ultimately, this project has turned into a deeply personal exploration of vulnerability, fragility, strength, and beauty. FEATHERWEIGHT is meant to honor how intense and divine it is to be delicate sometimes, and to chronicle what it looks like learning to celebrate that. \n\n//\n\n\"Nothing is the same!\" \n\nThis is the first piece I created in this collection that truly, truly meant something to me. This is where the entire project began, although I don't necessarily see it as the beginning of the narrative. \n\nThe first collector of this piece may opt to receive a physical copy of the piece. \n\n30.0\" x 20.0\nLightjet\nFujicolor Crystal Archive Super Type C Glossy\n\nThank you \n*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧",
