    "name": "The Unexpected Rise ",
    "description": "My spouse and I organized a photographer meet up at the top of the Willis Tower (Always Sears) in Chicago for sunrise. It was February 18th 2018 at 6:00 am.. It was low fog and hardly any visibility. When we drove towards the city we were very pessimistic about how this meeting would turn out, but we were already committed and we were not going to give up or disappoint the other photographers who took the effort to come up as well. When we arrived at the top of the Tower Lo and Behold, the fog was so low that it didn't affect the buildings above and it was a premise of great things to come. Around 6:58 am, I witnessed one of the best sunrises I have ever seen in the city of Chicago. The light hitting the buildings and the low fog was pure magic. \n\n\n\nThat day I learned that when it comes to sunrise you have to wait until the end because you never know what you'll miss. Expect the Unexpected.",
