    "description": "In this painting I tried to show the deconstruction of the image of a woman and to expose the opposite poles of her identity: the symbol of masculinity is contrasted with the attributes that in traditional society are associated with purely feminine activities.\nUsing the methods of classical still life, a new field of gender studies is created. From this perspective, the compilation of objects becomes a means of creating a feminine image during the dominance of the new norm.\n\nOne way or another, each object is a target for further creating your own impressions and for revealing unique emotions.",
