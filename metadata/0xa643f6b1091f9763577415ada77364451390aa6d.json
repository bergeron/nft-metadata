    "description": "Contemporary extrapolation of a work by a Grand Master of French painting from the end of the 19th century \"Déjeuner sur L'herbe\", Édouard Manet c. 1863, Musee d'Orsay, Paris.\n\nMixed media on canvas\n24 X 30 X 1,50\"\nAudrey Néron, 2020\n\nMy creative process;\n\nI reinterpret in iconographic representations of themes and atmospheres that are recurring and very often epic. Inspired by images of painters from another era with the same narrative sensitivity, I continue the conversation with a current perspective.\nI disfigure the characters or substitute them with the faces of people from my own tribe and hijack the story by appropriating it to myself.\n\nMy research project with this series is to manage to play between figuration and abstraction in order to extract the essence of the subject and to transcend emotion.\n\n",
