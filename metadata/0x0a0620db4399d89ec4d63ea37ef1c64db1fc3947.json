    "description": "La Linea\n\nThough the silent witness of a dramatic accident, this chalk line actually makes me happy and catapults me back to my childhood when La Linea was probably my favorite cartoon.\n\nThe animation was simple, just one line which was the main character and everything else for that matter.\nIâ€™ll never forget how he got mad and in his non-verbal voice would shout at the animator. For those too young to know the cartoon...go look it up!\n\n\nChalk was used to visualize the trajectory of the vehicles involved.\nIn these photographs it often creates a focus point where otherwise there would be none.\n\nSometimes the chalk almost seems burnt into the image.\n\nPure white in sharp contrast to the brutality of a car crash.",
