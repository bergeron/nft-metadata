    "description": "The meteoric rise and the sudden crash of Terra Luna has undoubtedly sent shockwaves across the crypto world. One unit of the Luna token now costs less than a cent, significantly down from its peak of $116.\n\nDespite this, the Luna community has decided to pick up the pieces and build again. On 28 May 2022, just a few days after the crash, a new chain was launched. The old $Luna token was renamed to Luna Classic ($LUNC), and the new token is called Luna ($LUNA). The world is closely watching to see how Terra Luna's rebirth will pan out.\n\nUsing $LUNC's price chart from December 2020 to May 2022, this artwork is a depiction of Luna's story told through a surreal cryptoscape.",
