    "description": "I design environments that stimulate the sensory awareness of the observer. Some of the terms that can be used to try to define my work are \"ambient art\" or \"environmental art\". An integral part of my work is light as a primary medium and I am interested in the suppression of imagery. I use light to its fullest potential as a sculptural material to alter the viewer's perception. My work deliberately engages the spatial and sensory dimensions of light, including its aesthetics and immateriality, rather than using light as a simple material element.\n\nLight flows in straight lines and is perpetually in motion, more so than any other sculptural medium. All sculpture with light is about directing and shaping its emission. That is why in my creative process I use a variety of light sources and media, each with its own aesthetic qualities and spatial possibilities.\n",
