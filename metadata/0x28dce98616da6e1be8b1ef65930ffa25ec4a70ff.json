    "description": "we've all (hopefully) seen the meme. now everyone's favorite creepy-eyed, open-mouthed stick figure gets his own theme song.\n\nwhether you have any clue about what i'm talking about or not, this song is one of my wildest ever and completely unhinged. i wouldn't suggest you play this for meemaw (unless she's bout that kind of stuff!) but the attitude in the instrumental of this track alone might make you wanna get crunk--something no one's done for years, unfortunately.\n\nnah but seriously, i like the idea of everyone embracing their own sexuality, and I try to encourage that in my own weird way through some of my music. lyrics like the ones in this song are not in any way intended to mindlessly objectify women, but rather to try to destigmatize what it means to explore and embrace both ourselves and one another (consensually of course) in a fun, lighthearted way when possible.\n\n(sidenote: i originally intended to get a female rapper to do the second verse but it didn't end up working out. so the pitched up vocals you hear are mine pretending to be that rapper lol--it was a fun exercise)",
