    "description": "Historians estimate that the Kumeyaay, local Native Americans, were on the land now called La Jolla for around 3,000 years before it was colonized. The Kumeyaay called La Jolla “Kulaaxuuy,” which means “land of holes.” \n\nI attended UCSD, which is in beautiful La Jolla. Many renowned artists, painters and writers lived in La Jolla - the most famous are Dr. Seuss and Raymond Chandler.\n\nWhile visiting La Jolla in the spring of 2022, I captured this image of a rose in downtown La Jolla.",
