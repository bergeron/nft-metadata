    "description": "This is the first of many concepts for the real life neo noir components of *working title*. No that's not the title, an animated short film, or limited series, or long series cartoon/anime/drama whatever show. I'm using an enormous number of references to my own life and the places I go/live/drink/play etc. This bar scene is based on a bar I drink at and play pool. You can usually find me there drinking tequila and running a game only to scratch the 8 ball at the end. My strategy for writing this story is inspired mostly by Bakshi and Tarantino, a combination of real life bar combinations I eavesdrop on by mistake, and the realistic unfolding of a narrative that isn't too contrived, with less than obvious heroes and villains. I want something real, and in reality, people are flawed. I'm happy to have so many of you on this journey with me.\n\n\nAlso shoutout to MADLETHAL, who has Page 1 of \"Death by Punchcard\" which is the combat/boxing tournament component of this show. \n\nLotsa moving parts, I know.\n\n\nBest,\n\n\nGunnar Magnus",
