    "name": "Portrait of Uzbek woman",
    "description": "The portrait of an Uzbek woman is a collective image of women who carry themselves day by day through inequalities rooted for centuries. Through a changing world in which women's rights are still being infringed. They are ordinary women, but they are incomparably strong and beautiful. Look at the eyes of a woman who goes through all the trials of life and at the same time remains beautiful. What do you see there?",
