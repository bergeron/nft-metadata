    "description": "This performance portrait seems to have an intense staging but it is the body who owns the space, he wants to occupy it infinitely. It’s the expression of a small tiny part of a soul that can be revealed. It is to undertake the inverse way, to let the “Me” appear to integrate profoundly. It’s a language with speaking where only the body expresses itself. Then just for a moment, one instant to be a part of Me.",
