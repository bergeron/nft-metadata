    "description": "Rudabeh is pregnant, in great pain, and unable to give birth. Zal remembers the Simorgh's feather. He burns it and the Simorgh appears. The bird orders and arranges the first caesarean birth, giving Rudabeh healing herbs and stroking her with her feathers. Rudabeh gives birth to a huge son, \"a lion cub\", Rostam.\n\nRostam is a miracle baby and has grown into a boy within 5 days and to the height and strength of a young man within weeks. As a child, he is the only one able to kill a white elephant that is rampaging unstoppable through the palace.",
