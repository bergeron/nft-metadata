    "description": "The sun has risen. The dew is still cool and wet on the grass that tickle your toes. You hold your dearest love close and listen to the birds chirp in the spring air. The flower petals dance around your face and the sweet scent lingers. It's Monday morning in the streets of Harajuku and Spring is fresh in the air.",
