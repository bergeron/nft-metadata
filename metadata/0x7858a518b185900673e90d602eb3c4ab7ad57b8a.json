    "description": "An African elephant tail on the hand of a member of Zambia's special anti-poaching unit (SAPU). The confiscated tail was taken from poachers operating near Kafue National Park in Zambia, Africa.\n\nDespite increased efforts, and the presence of SAPU members, this anti-poaching unit still requires additionally resources to combat poaching occurrences that target elephants that use Itezhi-Tezhi lake as a watering hole. \n\n~\n\nThis NFT was made with permission from SAPU and is part of the Bear Witness collection, a curated body of work exploring the inseparable link between people and planet through the convergence of art and the documentary approach.\n\nA percentage of this NFT sale will go towards Game Rangers International.",
