    "description": "Andrea is an artist. She loves painting and using gold on her paints. As a masterpiece herself she models for the camera while brushing her black curls with a golden comb.  \nAt her own place, using only things found at her studio and house, we created a set just for her. Where she can feel kissed by the orange, gold and cyan lights. Colors that are also present on her paintings. She inspires me. Cause as a woman, she loves the skin she's in, taking care of herself is a ritual. Grapeseed oil, warm water and good music on, she enters her zone and admires who she has become. Powerful, talented, and brilliant woman.",
