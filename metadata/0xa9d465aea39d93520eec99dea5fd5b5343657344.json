    "description": "This is, without exaggeration, the real \"Stairway to Hell\". To get to the honeycombs, hunters first need to drive off the \"fighting\" bees guarding the hive. Hunters make fires under cliffs, stuffing them with damp grass, leaves and young branches - everything that produces the most concentrated smoke.\n\nThousands of frenzied bees, armed with deadly stingers, rush about in the smoke in search of the intruder. Having found the victim, they pounce on it with the whole swarm and woe to the one who gets in their way. For an unprotected person, this is certain death!",
