    "description": "The world is covered in WAR.\n\nThis is a scene taken from the animated short film WAR by Lito Akari.\nA sinister experimental film in apocalypse red, observed with a flickering, grainy super8 cam. Distorted low-bandwith sound intensifies the dazing atmosphere. You see no humans at all - just those man-made machines trailing WAR behind them.\n\nThe humble collector will receive the showcased visual, the complete 1:43 minutes long animation film as seen at studiovolito.com/war (both as 1920x1080 high quality video) and shall be blessed forever.",
