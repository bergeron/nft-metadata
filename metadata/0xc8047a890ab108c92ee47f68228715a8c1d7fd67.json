    "description": "The celestial nomad is a mythical figure that roams the cosmos, never tethered to a particular planet or star system. They travel freely among the vastness of space, seeking new experiences and knowledge. With no fixed destination, a celestial nomad embodies the spirit of exploration and adventure, embracing the unknown and constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. They are a symbol of the human desire for discovery and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our earthly limitations.",
