    "description": "     \n      The short film was developed with one important thought in mind, that modern cinema is less enamoured with poetry than it is with visual design.\n       The film’s beliefs are that It’s much more interactive than “classic” filmmaking  because there is more left to the imagination, and even more up for interpretation. Although cinema may not outwardly  seem to have any debt to poetry, in the films' skeletons – their screenplays – we can see a similar paring down of language, an immediacy of and reliance on the image. Visual design is more closely related to graphic design, and it doesn’t have as much of a poetic element. Visual poetry is explicitly left up for interpretation.\n        The viewers are encouraged to take a step ahead and ask themselves:\n\n\nWhy are the two young lovers there ? \nDid they just met ? \nWhy is there no dialogue ? \nWhat would the dialogue be ? \nSlowly, as the story unfolds, we come to realize that finding our own paths makes us creators ourselves.\n",
