    "name": "Neon Allosaurus",
    "description": "Allosaurus is a genus of large carnosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived 155 to 145 million years ago during the Late Jurassic epoch (Kimmeridgian to late Tithonian).\n\nThe name \"Allosaurus\" means \"different lizard\" alluding to its unique (at the time of its discovery) concave vertebrae. It is derived from the Greek ἄλλος (allos) (\"different, other\") and σαῦρος (sauros) (\"lizard / generic reptile\"). \n\nThe first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of paleontological circles. ",
