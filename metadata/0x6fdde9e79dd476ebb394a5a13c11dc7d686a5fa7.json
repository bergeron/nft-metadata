    "description": "The search for the right way is, so to speak, a synonym for our life. We go through life striving to do the right thing and to leave our mark. And like on a journey, sometimes we don't turn at the right place. But it is important to find the right way again and not to get lost. The search for the right path should remain visible in my pictures and sometimes the goal is reached and sometimes not. The pictures are fed by the many impressions that the many journeys leave in the mind and thus become part of the search.\nWhen the viewer stands in front of the painting, gets lost in it and begins to see his own truths in it, then he too has started his own search and the creative circle is closed - a new journey begins.",
