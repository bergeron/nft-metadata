    "description": "During a conversation with my father, he reminisced about his youth and the time he had to take care of the chickens on his family farm. He expressed dislike for the roosters due to their aggressive behavior.\n\nListening to his story, my imagination soared, picturing my dad as a trendy elderly man residing in New York City. In this whimsical vision, he strutted the streets donning the finest attire, accompanied by his beloved pet rooster, who had somehow become his loyal companion.\n\nAI Artwork\n"
