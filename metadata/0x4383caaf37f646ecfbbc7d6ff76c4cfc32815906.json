    "name": "Deserted",
    "description": "\"Deserted\" symbolizes the fleeting and impermanent nature of life. Just like the object in the sky is carried along by the currents of the air, we are carried along by the forces that shape our lives. \n\nLike the particle, we have the power to choose how we respond to these forces and create our own path through the universe.\n\nA reminder to trust the journey of life, even when it feels deserted or uncertain. It may be challenging at times, but ultimately, we are all connected and guided by a greater force.",
