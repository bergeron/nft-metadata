    "name": "ABE 'dropkick' LINCOLN",
    "description": "Oh, but a tale of Abraham Lincoln's might,\nA man of stature, with wrestling in sight.\nIn youth, he fought to fend off bulliesâ€™ woes,\nA sport in which he found his strength, it rose.\n\nWith skill and strength, he mastered every hold,\nHis prowess in wrestling tales would be told.\nBut brute force and technique, they did divide,\nWith fervor, Lincoln studied, he never did hide.\n\nOne day, a move so innovative he made,\nA drop kick that left his opponents dismayed.\nInstead of grappling, he'd leap to the sky,\nA swift kick, his rivals would fall by.\n\nThis game-changer brought Lincoln to fame,\nHe traveled, challenged, and won every game.\nA wrestling champion he was, no doubt,\nBut politics, leadership, his true calling would sprout.\n\nAnd so, he left the wrestling world behind,\nTo serve his country, a new path he'd find.\nBut in the ring, he'd learned the lessons of might,\nA drop kick, his legacy, a tale of his fight.",
