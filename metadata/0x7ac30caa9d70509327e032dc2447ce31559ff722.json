    "description": "The Temple of Baalshamin was an ancient temple in the city of Palmyra, Syria, dedicated to the Canaanite sky deity Baalshamin. The temple's earliest phase dates to the late 2nd century BC, its altar was built in 115 AD, and the temple was substantially rebuilt in 131 AD. \n\nIn 1864, French photographer and naval officer Louis Vignes was the first to photograph the temple following his expedition to the Dead Sea under the sponsorship of the Duc du Luynes.\n\nOn July 20th 2007, American photographer Holt Haynsworth photographed it at dusk. This is the last and only known night photograph of the temple.\n\nIn 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant demolished the Temple of Baalshamin after capturing Palmyra during the Syrian Civil War.\n\nJuly 20, 2007\n4236x2912\n12.3 MP\nCanon EOS 5D\n24-70mm f/2.8L USM\n4.0 sec at f / 2.8\n\nHolt Haynsworth\nwww.HaynsworthPhotography.com",
