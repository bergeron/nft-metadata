    "description": "Life is a chaotic and beautiful journey that will take you places you’ve never imagined and show you things you’ve never seen. If you’re lucky, along this crazy journey you will come across certain things that just speak to you, things that you just seem to be drawn toward, things that will go on to hold a special place in your heart. These are some of my things, some of these may be your things too, and that is a connection we share. Neon Nostalgia (Things) is a deeply personal homage to my youth, growing up in the 90s and the infinite number of cool things that have influenced me along my wild journey.",
