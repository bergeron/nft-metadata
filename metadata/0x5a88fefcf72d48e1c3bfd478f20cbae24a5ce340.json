    "description": "I took this picture while in Island Park Idaho on a snowmobile trip in December of 2022. We had just got caught in a ravine we should not have been in and were lucky to make it out with everyone’s snowmobiles in one piece. We were in a race against the light to try and get home before dark. As we came up to this bridge crossing over the stream, I was star-struck by the orange glow that lingered over the water. I had no choice but to stop and admire this beautiful scene. My radio started blowing up with the group wondering where I was and why I stopped, but I hopped on and radio and said, “Don’t worry guys, I got a picture of a lifetime. Something you won’t want to miss.\"\n\n\nCamera: iPhone 13 Pro.\n\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 Ryan Allamian. The holder of this NFT is granted a non-exclusive commercial license. All other rights reserved.
