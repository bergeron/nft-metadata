    "description": "This piece was captured during my last day assistant directing the short film Arca in the Fall of 2021. After an amazing and hectic week of filming, the crew and myself drove to Jekyll Island, just outside of Savannah, Georgia to film the final scene of the movie. We arrived at the beach early and carried the wardrobe to a secluded part of the beach and all waited until sunset to film the final scene. In those moments of waiting, we all had the opportunity to reflect and remember the joys and chaos of making the film. It was a special moment of fear, joy and anxiety as we waited for golden hour to commence in preparation of the final shot of the film. This piece holds a spacial place in my heart as it was the first professional project I was apart of and it encouraged me to push my creative boundaries. The piece will act as a split for film directors who I'm looking to onboard into the space and I will be mailing the original film negative to the holder. ",
