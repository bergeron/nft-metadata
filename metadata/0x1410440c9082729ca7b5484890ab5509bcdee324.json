    "description": "Landing in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, I felt a welcoming like never before, a sense of space and purpose. A visceral feeling, the awareness that my soul had returned. \n\nI see now, it was me - time for myself, cut off from the outside world, with no wifi, no phone reception and no electricity I was able just to be. My mind didn’t wander, didn’t falter - I was present. With this omnipresence, I felt that deep connection to the environment, witnessing the sunset realising the futility of mans need to force and change. \n\n——\n\nAfter a long days riding, there’s nothing quite like a sauna followed by a dip in cold water. The beauty of Jalman Meadows is both are on tap. These three set up the Sauna Ger by the river, the perfect wild spa…  \n\nAfter setting up the Ger for us, I asked for a picture, this is what they gave me… \n\nWhilst retreating with Emma Henry & Reclaim Your Self in conjunction with Lululemon in 2015\n\n7360 X 4912 px\n",
