    "description": "The soulmate is the key of the project. \nThis is an evolving AI painting generated by a dataset based on Lana's paintings and mastermind. By holding this piece, you can claim one painting - a soul-  in the Lost Souls museum. After being used, the piece will be burned and minted again for a new holder. The soulmate will have a new appearance each time it is minted.\n\nNo one can predict its final form because its evolution is dictated by the choices of each of the 10 Soulsâ€™ holders. \n\nAccess the Lost Souls museum here : \nhttps://www.soulmate.earth/museum",
