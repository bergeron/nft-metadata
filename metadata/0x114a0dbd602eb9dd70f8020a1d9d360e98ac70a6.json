    "description": "Hi, I am Kiwi Kawaii ^^ Pride is excessive belief in one's own abilities, that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity. Of the seven deadly sins, pride is the only one with a virtuous side. It is certainly a good thing to have pride in one's community, in oneself. But when taken too far, these virtues become deadly sins. \"It was Pride that changed angels into devils; it is humility that makes men as angels.\" - St. Augustine",
