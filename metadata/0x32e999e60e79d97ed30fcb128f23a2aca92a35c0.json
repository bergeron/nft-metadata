    "description": "When they first appeared, it was an anomaly. The general consensus was that some freak atomic irradiation incident had transformed a handful of folk into a heresy of nature. Their technicolor appearance gave credence to this theory. As more and more appear, it has become clear that something is actively creating these creatures. Once in a while, you might see an Atomik that you once scavenged with sporting this new, grotesque form. Is it some scientist hellbent of rising in ranks to join the Gods of the Wastes? Or is it something far darker, far older? Is it unnatural magic? Only the NekroVerse holds the answers.",
