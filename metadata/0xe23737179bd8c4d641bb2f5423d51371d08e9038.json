    "description": "People say that hard work equals victory, but that's not always the case. There is no more desperate feeling than putting all our strength into a single cause and yet not seeing our longed-for results. Being at this point my world began to turn gray without realizing it, there was no going back because I had already exhausted all my strength working hard and my emotions were trampled by failure. The dark days came into my life, in a cycle that never seemed to end. Wanting to escape is the only thing he wanted, but it was already too late, he was falling into the depths of an abyss that seemed to have no end. “When will this end? Please let me be happy” were my thoughts. I began to hear my own crying, but I thought that those tears I was seeing were not mine, they were too colorful and I was gray. It was then that I realized that I was drowning in my own chaos, a chaos created by my colored tears.",
