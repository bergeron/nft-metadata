    "description": "Twenty-five pieces for March 25, the first Saturday of Spring 2023.\n\nAs I stared out the window into the streets of my sleepy little city this morning, I wondered what it might be like where you are. It's peaceful here - but what does peaceful look like for you?\n\nI don't know that I'd rather be in the spaces in this collection, but I certainly wouldn't mind knowing what they feel like on a day like this. All so similar, but all so different.",
