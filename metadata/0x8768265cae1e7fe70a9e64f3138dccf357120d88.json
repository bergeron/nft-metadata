    "description": "\"I had this crazy dream\nand the last thing I remember was this strange figure\nsomehow it resembled myself\nand I had never looked so unforgettably stupid\n\nAs I closed my eyes, I heard it say:\n\nIsn't it time to embrace the unknown?\nthe irony, the improv, the surreal and the absurd \nthat is to live, to laugh, to sing and to love\nin this scared little world, when no one else does?\n\n...Hey bud, don't you like jazz?\"\n\nThe piece is an ode to the irony of life, dreams and the surreal. Inspired by the aspirations of the surrealist movement and how the possibility of re-imagining ourselves can, still today, be the key to changing our own perspective and consequently, our own world.\n\nCreated for the AI Surrealism exhibition at Oculus NYC, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT and Exquisite Workers. The largest AI art show in history, featuring 100 AI artists, June 2-8, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus.",
