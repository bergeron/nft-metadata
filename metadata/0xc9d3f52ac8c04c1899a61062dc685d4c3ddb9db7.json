    "description": "During his training as a media designer, John Kinski discovered a love of illustration and minimalism. Instead of grand gestures, the artist places hesitation and ambiguity in both form and content. The images are characterized by a vibrant colorfulness. With his works he likes to refer to his home continent: Europe. Thus, John Kinski succeeds with his abstract works to take us to Norway, but perhaps also to Spain. Watch John Kinski on his journey to outdo himself again and again.",
