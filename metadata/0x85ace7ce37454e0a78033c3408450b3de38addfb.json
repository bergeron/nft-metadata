    "description": "I entered the NFT space in Feb 2021 with one clear goal... to sustain Van and Photography life. \n\nI was binging Clubhouse. And then the magic happened, my first Portrait sold in the March.. I broke free from the norm. \n\nMy Photography business had always centred around portraiture, but there was a creative drive burning inside to head to the coast and shoot Surf.\n\nI had finished up a Photography Job in London then drove 6 hours to the South West of England, North Devon. \n\nI parked in an inlet on the side of a cliff that overlooked Saunton Sands. I cracked open a cider with the other Van Lifers parked next to me. \n\nAt 5am I woke up to the sound of the waves, poked my head out of the side door and saw a Lone Surfer catching his first break of the day. \n\nQuickly I grabbed the Camera... the Dream was alive... I was shooting surf... It felt wholesome. \n\nIt would seem fitting that after 1 year in the NFT space I would finally get my Foundation invite and this be the Photograph that I mint.\n\n",
