    "description": "Taken off the northern coast of Kauai, this image captures one of the most stunning skies I’ve ever witnessed. The colors seemingly pulled from the hottest flames and transferred to the sky above me - I was in awe as the shutter closed. \n\nThe air was still, and this lone palm was the only other witness to the beauty before me. It’s my pleasure to share this image of what was truly a memorable evening.",
