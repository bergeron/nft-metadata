    "description": "This art is created using the p5.js library and webgl technology. The code sets up a canvas and defines a draw function that is repeatedly called at a specified frame rate. In the draw function, a number of vertices are randomly generated and stored in an array. The code then sets the fill color, stroke color, and stroke weight to random values and uses the vertices to draw a model on the canvas. The model is rotated slightly on each frame and the canvas is cleared and redrawn. \n\n.004eth, 3per wallet, 0% royalties",
