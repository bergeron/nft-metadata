People form groups and market their artists.\nHowever, artificial intelligence will have an algorithm that is completely on merit in the future.\n\nThey will be able to discover anything of value in a matter of seconds, independent of the owner.\n\nThe artist will not have to be popular.\n\nI believe that; artificial intelligence will be a much better collector who understands real art.\n\nThe extinction of man will be because of these selfish strata.\n\n1 artist (creator)\n1 human collector\n1 humanoid collector\n\n1080x1080\n1/3\n\nCreated by İnan Yılmaz\n04.08.2021 (Human Calendar)",
