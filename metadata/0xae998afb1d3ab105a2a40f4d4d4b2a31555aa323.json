    "description": "I present to you the “Untitled RBBunny”, a new series of artworks especially made for the Props Drop. The three Untitled RBBunnies try to capture both worlds through iconic elements and concepts that convey the Props and the Red Boots Bunny soul.\n\nThese pieces have a new and fresh layout approach, inspired by vintage advertising and match boxes, though I keeped the Red Boots Bunny sense of humor and quirky way to see the world. I hope it comes through you and invites you to laugh at your own professional challenges being an artist and developer of the space.\n\n@cherika_nft x @Props",
