    "description": "We are Hannah and Díma, an independent Barcelona-based film director and cinematographer family. We met on the film set and fell in love at first sight.\n\nThese days we are working on The Cult - the new animated sci-fi miniseries  about: \n\nA young neuroscientist named Pia who becomes entangled in a war between technological and spiritual cults. \n\nJust before the conflict, she discovers a way to glimpse into the near future. \n\nTo see further and find the key to saving our planet from the war's consequences, she must journey into her past life.\n\nThe Cult is more than just a fascinating movie; it explores and popularizes current scientific and philosophical knowledge on human consciousness and death - timeless themes that resonate wit\n\nWe know that this story will fundamentally change people's minds.\n\nWe feel wholehearted that this series must be independent and have a voice far away from large industry.\n\nWith love & hug,\nHannah and Díma.",
