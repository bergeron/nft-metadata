    "description": "AI Sight is an attempt by this artist to step out of the AI's way and see what happens. \n\nTo achieve this I used GPT-2 (a text-generating machine learning code) for the best possible prompts to create beautiful AI art, and then input these prompts into my AI art workflow. This, with a little soundscape added, is the result. \n\nThese are some of AI's own ideas of what AI art might look like. The artist is not totally out of the picture (inputting some prompts in GPT-2, curating outputs), but merely taking a step back to admire the view, and appreciate the AI Sight.\n\nAs always, 50% of all sales & royalties from Rainforests' projects go directly to rainforest conservation, documented regularly on my Twitter.\n\nWAGMI if the Earth makes it. Ty & GM",
