    "description": "Herix serves on the Galactic Council as High Ambassador. Sometimes he is seen watching from the shadows, plotting how he can best help the citizens of the empire. Many question his motives, but he only has the best intentions.\n\nHigh Ambassador Herix is created from a combination of images made by AI and photography taken by Decryptolorian. He is composed of several layers which have been digitally manipulated and lightly animated within photoshop.\n\nLICENSE\n\nExtended Editorial: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
