    "description": "The genesis of my curler collection, started one day on the boulevard Magenta in Paris in the spring. I was walking with my son and I passed an \"old school\" hairdresser, and there I was captivated by the store window. It was full of heads with curlers. It was a flashback, my childhood with my mother using them. I had to make a series honoring this emotion. \n\n\n#1\nSpring Series\nEdition 1/1\n2500*1667, Jpg",
