    "description": "Even though I have pretty much never practiced this photographic genre and in 99% of cases I hate having human figures in my photos, I could not resist from photographing this scene. I was (positively) impressed by this old lady who, despite the snowstorm and the cold, still went out to do her daily shopping, from the pantry and the greengrocer.\n\nBy far one of the rarest pieces in the collection - the only black and white image and the only one with a person as a subject!",
