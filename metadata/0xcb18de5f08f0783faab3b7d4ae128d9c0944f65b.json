    "description": "'crush' is another one of the many love songs I've written this year and one of my favorites so far. The song is inspired by my current fascination of hyperpop vocals and catchy vocal chop melodies. As someone who makes EDM most of the time, it's always a breath of fresh air to create something more simple (sometimes less is more when it comes to music production).\n\nWritten, recorded, produced, mixed, and mastered by me in my little bedroom studio.\n\n",
