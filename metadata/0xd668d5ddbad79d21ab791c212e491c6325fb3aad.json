    "description": "The hallway of the hotel provided the perfect backdrop for the shoot, with its vintage and somewhat grubby patina, everything was perfect. Particularly the unwashed windows which provided a diffused light that added a soft, warm glow to the images, creating a cozy and intimate atmosphere. With the shot done, the client was very happy, and with time in hand, we manages a second shoot for ourselves.",
