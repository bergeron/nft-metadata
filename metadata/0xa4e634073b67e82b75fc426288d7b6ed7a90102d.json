    "description": "Cherry lipped dreaming, of nights drinking vodka slumped over ceramic bathtubs\n\nI sang in front of cracked mirrors, while blood dripped down my fingers, scrolling over digital pictures, of us in the hanging gardens, laying over each otherâ€™s bodies\n\nIn front of the sun and stars, you smiled at me while you painted\nYou put it up on the gram and never deleted it after that occasion\n\nWe headed home, dancing on sidewalks against a diaspora of headlights, songs from your favourite podcasts\nAnd yet as we entered heaven, a 7/11\n\nI saw the light in your eyes die, when I refused the kiss \nAnd your skin turned pale, when you realized the bliss, we lived was a lie\nIt was temporary, a cosmic misdirection\nFor what you wished to happen\nWe both fell in love, but for only a moment\n\nAnd as I scrolled through my phone, booking a ride home\nWe sat next to each other\nBut deep down I knew I was alone.\n\nhttps://objkt.com/asset/KT19U7HaXK7v9W2Gx1Aq5d7G3w8Jgu8Y6ZDJ/2",
