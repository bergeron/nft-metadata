    "description": "The mighty branch holds firm through time and space. The olive branch has long served as a lasting symbol of our commitment to each other and a future filled with hope. The dove carries this branch as proof: A sign of the promised land not far away. Composed of 64 total pieces (40 main sections), the branch showcases a more traditional painting approach, spectacularly shaded, leaping from the canvas, outstretched for us to take hold of. \n\nThis collection is the concept art for the iconic Olive Branch present in the Vision of Unity and Peace monument.",
