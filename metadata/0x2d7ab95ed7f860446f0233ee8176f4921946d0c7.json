    "description": "This photograph is part of my series, \"Unfiltered Imagination\", which is an extension of my \"Beyond These Walls\" project. Like much of my work, this project is a collection which captures the essence of my belief that emotion and beauty cannot be contained or restricted by the walls we may place around us. Furthermore, the beauty around us should be seen as an action of forming new ideas and images. ",
