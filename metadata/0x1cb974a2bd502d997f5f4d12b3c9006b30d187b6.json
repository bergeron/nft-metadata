    "description": "This handmade work of pizza art was made to commemorate World Penguin Day.  It is the first piece in a three part series of Pizza Portraits to be released in 2022 featuring endangered species from around the world.\n\nIt made using four full sheet pans (3' x 4.33') making it one of the largest works of pizza art ever made.  Toppings include black olives, orange bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, fresh tomatoes, black pepper powder, garlic powder, with grated Romano and shredded mozzarella cheeses.\n\nNo food was wasted during the making of this artwork.\n\nThe collector of this piece unlocks a private masterclass on pizza making as well as a shipment of Italian sauces.\n\n10% of the proceeds from the initial sale of this Pizza Portrait will be donated to the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organization that works to help protect threatened and endangered species from around the world.",
