    "description": "sometimes they’d be there\nother times they wouldn’t\nin the retention pond\nwe learned to swim in\nwhere you almost drowned\nthat one summer\nnow there wasn’t swimming anymore\nor summer\nbut there was salvation\nin the liver spotted hands\nof television messiahs\nwho said the clouds could rain down\nthe fortified wine blood of a savior we never knew or didn’t care to know\nthough the pond seemed to grow more shallow every year because the blood never came\nand we still got our buzz from the gas station\nthat also sold nails for crucifixion\nthough they never did pierce a hand or a foot\nand mainly held up the treehouse dad built before he left\nwe’d wade in anyway\nbecause it was better than being dry\nand sometimes when the water seemed to heal our skin\nthat seemed to never scab\nbecause sometimes it was easier to go under\nthan stay afloat",
