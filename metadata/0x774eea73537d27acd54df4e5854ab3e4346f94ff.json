    "description": "Http-errors is a collection based on the history of the internet itself. Each error is unique and has its own meaning. They are the backbone of the way the web works. Without them, the internet would not exist. From the most famous error (#404) to the unassigned ones, discover how the most important tool of our century is built! This collection, entirely handmade, is collaborative and is based on an important redistribution principle: many draws and gifts for each owner of the errors! Discover the whole roadmap on our website. In short, a historical, artistic and community project based on daily mistakes. We are all errors.",
