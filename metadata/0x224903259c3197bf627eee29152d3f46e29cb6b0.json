This artwork represents the personal handling of our character due to the power of supervising our emotions. The subject (girl) is shown with the brain as a puppet. It demonstrates that its our feeling that defines us. The way we think, is how we reflect and upon that our personality is developed. Being positive, kind and just is what makes us good human.",
