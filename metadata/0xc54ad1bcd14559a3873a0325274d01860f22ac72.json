    "description": "The Elasticity collection grew out of my love for both shape and color. The artwork is part of a continuing examination of how the two can interact to create movement.\n\nBorrowing from the visual language of the great Futurist artists, like Umberto Boccioni, the collection embodies the dynamism that characterized the Futurist aesthetic. \n\nThe work is a new kind of Futurism, as seen through my own lens, and a digital medium. \n\n**Specifications**\n.MP4 file\n3000 x 3000 pixels\nCreated and minted by Amalia Versaci, 2021.",
