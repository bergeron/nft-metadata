    "description": "DANCING LADY\n\nCreated by \ndr.dashawatar bade  \nArtist: dashawatar \n\nMedium: Photography\n\nPrice: 0.02 ETH\n\nEdition: 20/20  \nEveryone of us has seen sculptures made from various media like stones,metals,but have you seen statues made from water or liquids,stay tuned to look into this genesis creation by me.\n\nThis img is a form of abstract photography,these imgs are made by droping a water droplet on a droplet that is bouncing back after dropping into floor liquid medium and these two droplets,ie,one from above n one from below collide n give various structures,there are a lots of factors which influence the structures,principally thickness of solution,distance from which dropping is done,also at a time we can drop 3 drops from upper side,in different colours and can get various colourful forms as well,this can be tried with water n milk also,this requires shutter speed of 1/15000 sec n above,also requires synchronization between camera,flash n drops,so coliision can be perfect,there is lot of trial n error involved,we can take imgs from eye level,low level n high camera angle too.,there is lot of fun doing the project,but requires lot of patience n technical knowledge.This requires use of macro lense,I have used Nikon d500 n kinon 105mm macro lense for this project,also specific equipment to synchronise camera,flash n colliding drops,drop size.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
