    "description": "1:1 image captured in the Fanal Forest, UNESCO Heritage Site, located on Madeira Island, Portugal. \nOne of the few places on Earth where the ancient Laurissilva forest is fully preserved. \n\nPhotographing this place feels like a return to the primitive Earth, where Nature dictated the rules and humankind lived in full communion with her. \n\nIn this image, a beautiful Til tree is represented, photographed in October 2019, under perfect fog conditions, which make this forest so mysterious, perfect and unique.\n\nWhile walking and photographing this forest, I looked at this branch that caught my attention, because it seemed that this beautiful tree was extending its arms towards me, like crying for help, reminding me that the time has come for the trees to reach their arms towards us, crying out for the retribution of the help and protection they once gave us.",
