    "description": "Because of the delightful reds, yellows, blues and greens... \nTheir tones and their splendid colors are dissolved in a cacophony woven harmony.  These colors resonate like music that expresses the mood of my soul.\nIt is a work that implies the various emotions and journeys of life.\n\nAs an unreleased work, it is the first work in a series of 'The gesture in life' that was produced on a low-spec computer in 1997.  It is a work reborn as an NFT art work in 2022.\n\n1400x1050px",
