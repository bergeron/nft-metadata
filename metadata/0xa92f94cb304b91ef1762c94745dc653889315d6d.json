    "description": "‘GANGS’ #06\n\nLos Angeles, California\n05.15.2019\n\nEDITION 1/1\n\nIn April of 2019, two young members of a Los Angeles gang invited me to view their automatic machine guns and hear what it’s like being born into organized crime.\n\nIt was a complicated reminder to never judge gang members by their outdated stereotypes.\n\n“GANGS” is the 25th installment of the FACES documentary video and photo series created by Josh Ethan Johnson. FACES are spontaneously shot documentary films and photos made with little to no prior knowledge of the subjects.\n",
