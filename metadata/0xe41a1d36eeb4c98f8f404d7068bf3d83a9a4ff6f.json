    "description": "Attention! A stroboscopic effect!!!\nI created this animation as a video frame animation in Photoshop. The work belongs to the aesthetic-scientific research project \"The private and the political: female rage! I created the images used with the SONY Alpha 5000 in February 2019.\n\nThe inspiration for the work was activist group \"Guerilla Girls\" (https://www.guerrillagirls.com/) who expose and make visible grievances regarding women as \"artistic objects\" in museum contexts and the visibility of female artists in the field of cultural industries. The marginalisation and discrimination of women as creators of art and culture from the real worlds are also transferred \"untranslated\" into the digital through the algorythms. To draw attention to this situation, I am intensively engaged with the subject as an artist.\n\nI deliberately included the stroboscopic effect in the video in order to visualise that this state of discrimination against women gives me a headache every day! \n\nR. von Roit\n",
