    "description": "Teahupo'o during a stormy day...\n\nTikanui is a world-renowned big wave rider from Mo'orea, the island just in front of Tahiti.\n\nA huge swell was announced that day, so a few surfers were \"towing in\" (when you get launched on a wave by a jetski because waves are too big to paddle in). We had a few beautiful waves during the day, but nothing extraordinary... until this set.\n\nI took many images from this wave, but this frame where the foam ball is catching up on Tikanui is my favorite.\n\nBeing so close to a massive breaking wave feels like thunder is crashing around you. The sound is overwhelming and you can feel the impact in your body. It feels very much alive... a living beast.\n\nIt is a good reminder of the power of our oceans and a very humbling experience.\n\nThis image is part of a collection displayed in French Polynesia's main hospital. As people wake up after a surgery, these images are the first thing they see. It is meaningful as surfing and the ocean is such a huge part of the culture there.",
