    "description": "BUNNi3? The Tall Cats wonder where he's gone ... If he's really gone to ground or if he's vanished into thin air like the fog off the autumn leaves that fall around them. They wait silently but with a slight twitchy itch of motion. Not much here except the costumes on each passerbyâ€¦the small goblins and ghosts that run by with coveted sacks of loot. Do they wonder where BUNNI3's gone or will they spy him hiding in plain site? See him racing across the neighbor's field? They live the unknown -- so they wait ... always wondering. Where is BUNNI3?\n\nKSR: 1500x1500x264dpi",
