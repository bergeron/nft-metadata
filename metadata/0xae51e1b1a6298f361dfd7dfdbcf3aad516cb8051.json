    "description": "\n“\"Nothing brings such confusion into the ideas of art like the belief in authority.\"   \n― Leo Nikolajewitsch Graf Tolstoi\n\nTheocratic authorities are people who have the power to make decisions and to make sure that their laws are obeyed.\n\nAt the age of 12, I read a book about the life of Michelangelo (in my opinion, Michaelangelo was the very 1st superstar artist!) and after a personal tragic and sad experience, I drew this art, which was my first drawing ever.\n\nD A V I D\nThe story behind my first art tells us the fight between Michelangelo and the church because of his David statue. The church did not want to see David naked (among other things). We now know Michelangelo has won.\n\nThe color purple, which was recovered from shells, symbolizes the popes and cardinals\nwho like to wear robes of this color, even though this fabric had a fishy smell.\n\nThe volatilization from the shawl shows the authority of religions, which lose their power over time.\n\n1/1\n00:10 (Endless)\nMP4/GIF\n1080 x 1",
