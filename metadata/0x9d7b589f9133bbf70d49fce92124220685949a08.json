    "description": "She represents the five elements of nature. While the expanse of green brings alive her ability to nurture and nourish earth, her eyes reflect the depth, mystery and calmness of the ocean. The fire on her forehead speaks of her passion, courage and inner strength. The stars in her hair represent the infinite space. Her magical enchanting aura is ever-changing, swirling around like the wind, leaving her impact that is calm, joyful, hopeful and beautiful.\n\nThis digital painting is inspired by Woman #3473, originally created by Yam Karkai, and is one of the 5 winners of the WoW Art Contest.",
