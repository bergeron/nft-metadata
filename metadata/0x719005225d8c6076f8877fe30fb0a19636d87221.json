    "description": "As I was walking under the scorching heat of the Japanese summer I saw her. \nShe was sitting on the edge of the sidewalk, a young girl yawning and tired, she had an exhausted look and a shirt subtly marked by tiny drops of sweat. \nSuddenly her delicate and innocent voice broke the silence asking her father to carry her as her arms were reaching up to the sky while her hands opened and closed.\n\nThe man, drenched in sweat didn't hesitate for a second, he smiled at his beloved daughter and bent over to carry her despite the extreme weather conditions.\n\nI followed them along the streets and alleys of Kyoto, he never let her go, she was safe in the arms of her hero...\n\n\nお疲れ様です - Otsukaresama desu in Japanese means “Good job” or “Thank you for your work”, acknowledging the great effort put into a heavy task. This piece, is a tribute to unconditional love, that love that no matter what, it's always there...\n\nBy: Ilan Derech\nLocation: Kyoto, Japan\nShot on: Leica SL & ZEISS ZM 1.4/35\nYear: 2022",
