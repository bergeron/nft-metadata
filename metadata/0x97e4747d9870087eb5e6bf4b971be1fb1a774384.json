    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them with you. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks, in web3 and beyond. We want to build this album in public, and bring our holders into the creative conversation as we go.\n\nIf we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music. WATCH THIS SPACE.\n\n“Do It Better” is the 2nd of these 24 singles. AM through and through. But don’t get us wrong - you can still play it on a boat at ear-shattering levels. This is our 2nd mint on Sound XYZ. Jump in and build with us. Next single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.\n\n“Do It Better” was born in a hotel room on Lake Como in Italy last summer. We tested it on a boat and trust us - it works. This was the anthem for our summer and we hope it will be your anthem for next summer.\n\nWe feel like this could be the start of something special, a grand experiment we can’t wait to bring into the world, and we’d love for you to jump in and build with us.",
