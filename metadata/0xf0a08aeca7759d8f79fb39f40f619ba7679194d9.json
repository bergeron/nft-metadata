    "description": "Kulasai Dussehra Festival - One of the most powerful grand festival in Tamilnadu.\n\nEven after two full days of working from early morning until late at night, I was not happy with my captures.\nBut I didn't give up and continued to wait there until dark, when all the other photographers had left. I was the only one remaining waiting for the one of a kind shot, and at that very moment, I managed to get this frame. I feel fortunate to have this frame because this is my most memorable movement.\n\n\nArtist : satzhema\n\nCollection: Rituals\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.  \nProvides no rights to create commercial merchandise, commercial distribution, or derivative works. \nCopyright remains with the creator.
