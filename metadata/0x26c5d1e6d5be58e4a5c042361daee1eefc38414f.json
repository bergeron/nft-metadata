    "description": "The cosmos is one of the most outsanding entities the human mind will ever come across. The endlessness of this singular phenomenon is an absolute wonder. Into The Void is that piece that depicts how all of the beauty of this emptiness is constantly calling us into itself because there is a portion of this same existence within us.\n\nThe depth of the universe is reaching out to the depth within our souls where the true essence of life lies. We need to regularly take time away from the noise and chaos around us just to conect with our inner selves which is a fragment of that same reality that exists in the cosmos.",
