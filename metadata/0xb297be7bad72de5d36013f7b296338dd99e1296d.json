    "description": "My own rendition of 'The Star' tarot card.\n\nThe Star card in Tarot represents renewal of the body and the spirit - inspiration to share your gifts and appreciate all that life has to offer. It represents hope after going through a major change aka the tower moment that forces you to surrender to things outside of your control.\n\nThis is the energy I’m in as I come to the close of some major cycles in my life. Divinely guided, I am inspired and hopeful for this renewal energy coming in as I fully immerse myself into Spring season. I finally feel like I can breathe and allow my creations to breathe. I let go of control and the need to know everything. I'm grateful for this wisdom and shift in my mindset. I am my own healer and the Universe is always supporting me. I’m beginning to see the light peaking through as I focus on being the light (the star) through my creative gifts. This piece is a gift.\n\nThank you in advance to whoever collects this piece. May it bring you peace. ",
