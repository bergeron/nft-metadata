    "description": "I lean out the door, I can barely breathe, the shack that protects my dreams can no longer withstand these storms, the dense environment crushes me, and I'm still that little boy who doesn't stop dreaming. I build walls inside that can save me from these gray days that threaten the end of everything. I lean out the door and shout loudly, let this bloody roar of freedom be heard far, far away. Then I breathe.",
