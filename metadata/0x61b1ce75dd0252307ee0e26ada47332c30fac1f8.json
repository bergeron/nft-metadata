    "name": "Flegara",
    "description": "A mysterious shaman who lives in a dense forest where the light hardly penetrates through the tree branches. She is accompanied by Luminus and her faithful wolf cub Shiru. And the ladybugs themselves once swore an oath of loyalty to her. Since then, they have been paving the way for people looking for Flegara. Why do people want Flegara? Because she makes them meet their deceased loved ones.",
