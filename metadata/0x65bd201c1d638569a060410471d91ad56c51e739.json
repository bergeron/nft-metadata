    "description": "Cellar2Cellar Group is a company specializing in delivering curated wine experiences and investment. We are on a mission to ensure the fine wine in our possession provides future buyers with a complete picture of provenance using blockchain technology. \n Cellar2Cellar currently owns a banded, Original Wooden Case of 2018 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, La Tache (6X750ML). This case is currently being stored in the USA in a professional temperature-controlled facility. \n  ‘The Task’ NFT creates a world where digital and physical are linked. \n The physical wine case has a smart tag attached that uses near-field communication (NFC) technology. The Smart tag provides a future buyer the ability to redeem proof of ownership via the NFT technology. The NFT carries attributes, who has owned the wine, the condition and temperature the wine has been kept in, and a complete certificate of authenticity that can be passed to a future buyer's wallet, time and time again over years to come.",
