    "description": "This is the picture of the first day of my artchallenge. It was not easy. All painters are familiar with fear of the empty canvas. I thought I have already forgotten about it. But not. I was watching at the blanc canvas and I didn’t know how I could to start. I saw it would be very affecting challenge.\n\nI thought I would paint faster. It would seem that it would be easy – to paint a little spontaneous picture without expectations and pretension to the final result, to the originality and technique. But this was wrong opinion. I wrote, and rewrote and rewrote again. I couldn't stop because I saw something new in my abstraction and I was starting change it again and again.\n\nI didn’t want to give to my art-works names. But when I was finishing this one, its name appeared in my head: \"Heels burn\". It's a literal idiom from russian, and I don’t know if there is an analogue in english. That means \"you run so fast as if someone or something is chasing after you\". That's my feeling.",
