    "description": "It's 21st century and still the act of self pleasure is considered as taboo. Masturbation is a form of Self-Love and Physiological need, not a Taboo. It's a very healthy, natural and beautiful process. Speaking openly, getting involved in meaningful discussions about masturbation, and standing in your power can help you accept and embrace it even more. This artwork talks about and tries to destroy the taboo around it.\n\n"
