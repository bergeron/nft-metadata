    "description": "I find inspiration in the vastness of the universe, where everything is suspended and moves together in perfect harmony. Each object I select from the world around me represents where my focus lies at the present moment.\n\nIn my art, I aim to convey a sense of weightlessness, as if the objects in my paintings are hovering in zero gravity, passing through different worlds.\n\nThis piece is made using spray cans on canvas.",
