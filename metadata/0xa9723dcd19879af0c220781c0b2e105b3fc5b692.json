    "description": "\nHello, I'm Sakura choco. I am a Japanese animation background artist.\nMy third work for FND is a night art.\n\nI love the lights at night, they're so exciting!\nUnlike the warm light, the dark and cloudy, but starry night is very uplifting.\nI hope you all enjoy it through art tooâœ¨\nThank you for watching this far! ðŸ¥°\n\nIt's hard to show the work of the background only.\nI would like to deliver the beauty of backgrounds through FND.\nMy dream is to get out there and become famous.\nPlease support me if you likeâœ¨\n",
