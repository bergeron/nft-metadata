    "description": "Our Worst battle is between what we know and what we feel. \n\nShould I or should I not, the tiny voice in the back of your head always commanding you, \nwarning you to be cautious.\n\nOur deepest and darkest secrets hushed up inside us, \nconstantly battling with us to let them out. \n\nThis illustration is a take on the contemporary world. \n\nFrom the outside, all of us seem to get it but what goes through the heart and brain seems to be a different story.\n",
