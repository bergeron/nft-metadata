    "description": "Bye bye 2020.\nThis is the last ray of sunshine I saw in 2020.\nA special year for humanity with Covid19 and lockdowns, but a year full of extraordinary things for my family, my friends and me.\nA year where the reduction of possibilities allowed me to refocus and decide to go as far as possible in what I love: photography, travel and sport.",
