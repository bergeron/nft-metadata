    "description": "This is the first work in color series, red.\nI created color series because I believe the world can't exist without color, and color allows us to have better memories in our lives. The inspiration of the series came from watching a sunset, which consisted of variety of beautiful colors. I wanted to express color of nature into the my works.\n\nRed is one of the primary colors which constructs our sight on viewing the beautiful scenaries in the world. Red is symbol of passionate love, courage, and good fortune. Hope this smiley girl and watermelon brings you good fortune!\n\n2400 x 3700 pixel 300 dpi\ncreated by Mungduck",
