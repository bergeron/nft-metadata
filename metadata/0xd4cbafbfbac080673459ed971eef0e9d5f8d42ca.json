    "description": "Like many others, I am in love with ancient buildings and structures around the world. I created this garden in two weeks and used some Ancient Achaemenid (500 BC) architectural elements in it. I had modeled the columns a few years ago for another personal project and the rest were modeled in the recent months. I modeled everything myself except the huge bearded man which is a scan made by Beno√Æt Rogez and I would like to thank him for this amazing scan.\nThe buyer will receive a the main video file which is An 8 GB 1080*1920 MP4 file.\n\nYou can see a 400 MB 1080*1920 version of this video in my artstation:\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/g8d1BE\n\nMusic:\nThis beautiful music piece is made by Scott Buckley,I would like to thank him.\nWayfarer by Scott Buckley -www.scottbuckley.com.au",
