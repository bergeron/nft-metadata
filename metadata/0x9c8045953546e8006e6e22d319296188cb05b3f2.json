    "description": "To Touch Forever\n\nCarlosâ€™ acrylic on canvas paintings unapologetically depict idyllic scenes devoid of irony or cynicism, stemming from his personal philosophy about life and beyond. Drawing the viewer into the world he paints, he puts focus on savouring life and at the same time, fixes their eyes on the promises of eternity.\n\n1920px x 1080px\n\nAnimated by Motioneer Isaiah Cacnio.",
