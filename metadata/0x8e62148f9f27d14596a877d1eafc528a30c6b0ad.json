    "description": "Street Performers is a project that aims to display the visual uniqueness of street artists in cities. Through this project, I hope to encourage others to participate more with street artists. Without them, the streets would be boring.\n\nThis project is ongoing. Each volume will portray an artist, with no cap on the number of volumes.\n\nWallets have been set up for artists who's likenesses are depicted in these frames. A royalty split of 20% is given to them on all sales.",
