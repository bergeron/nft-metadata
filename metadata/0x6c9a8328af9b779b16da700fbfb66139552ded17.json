    "description": "Chiarissimo di Giambuono de' Medici I (1167-1210) - The wool merchant. Chiarissimo grew the humble beginnings of the House of Medici as sheepherders by developing the family into successful wool merchants and moving them from their native Tuscan village of Cafaggiolo to Florence. After arriving, Chiarissimo became a member of the Wool Merchants Guild, Il Arte della Lana, one of the most powerful in Florence. His influence led to being appointed in 1201 to the Signoria of Florence, as one of nine Piori chosen from the guilds of the city, and thus establishing the foundation for the Medici political dynasty to flourish.\n\nWithin this painting and throughout the entire series, there is hidden meaning and symbolism. Both in the form of historical references as well as homage to crypto, NFT and meme culture and significant events. Are you able to find them all? Might there be a reward for completing this quest across pieces in the series? Time will tell...\n\n1/1 \nOil painting on wood panel",
