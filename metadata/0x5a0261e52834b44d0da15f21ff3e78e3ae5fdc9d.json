    "name": "FRED'S ESCAPE",
    "description": "Fred has always been a curious kid who loved to explore. He was dreaming of leaving his backyard and seeing the world beyond, but he knew his parents wouldn't leave him do that on his own.\n\nOne day, while his parents were out, he decided he had enough, and had to get out and see the world. He gathered some of his friends and came up with a plan. They built a staircase out of boxes and climbed over the fence. But just as Fred was about to climb over the fence, he hesitated. What if the world outside is too scary? What if they got lost and couldn't find their way back home? They were just kids, after all.\n\nBut then, he thought about all of the adventures that awaited them, and he took the plunge. They landed with a soft thug on the ground below and looked up at his backyard, which now seemed like a world away.\n\nFrom that day on, Fred and his friends lived a life of adventure and excitement exploring the wide world behind their cozy and safe homes.",
