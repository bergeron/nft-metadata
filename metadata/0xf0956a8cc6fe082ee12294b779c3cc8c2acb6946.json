    "description": "Into the night under the milky way, the air is filled with the glittering light of the galaxy overhead. The rocky alien plant below is a stark contrast to the soft, spongy ground of before. Its gnarled branches and roots twist and turn, creating a natural maze that you can't wait to explore. The rocky surface is rough under your feet, but it's a small price to pay for the chance to experience this otherworldly place. As you wander through the twisted branches, you can't help but feel a sense of excitement and adventure. This alien planet is unlike anything you've ever seen, and the thought of what other wonders might be hidden among its rocky terrain only adds to the thrill.",
