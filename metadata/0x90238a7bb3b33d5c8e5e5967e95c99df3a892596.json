    "description": "From the depths of time a relic appeared. A machine of metal from a distant year.\n\nThe ancients who built it have long since decayed. Its purpose unknown, its secrets delayed.\n\nA million years it lay dormant and free…\n\natop it is written “2023”.\n\nAn altar is built around it.
