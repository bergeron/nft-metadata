    "description": "Los Angeles, California\n\nI’m Alister, a still/motion photographer born in Japan, now based in Los Angeles. I found visual arts in my late teens and instantly knew that I had found my calling. My work is primarily conceptual which allows me to communicate my thoughts, emotions, curiosities, and experiences with my audience. Photography helps me find the answers, it helps me find the beauty in sometimes even the most simplest things. My goal with my work is to capture my audience’s intellect, imagination, and appreciation. I use my images as my voice.\n\nFilm photography has been the staple of my journey as an artist and I wanted to find a way to celebrate the medium with a community of talented film photographers. I am the creator/founder of 36 Exposures.",
