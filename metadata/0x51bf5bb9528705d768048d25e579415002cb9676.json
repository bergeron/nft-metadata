A digital drawing inspired by the clove tree, the spice that motivated Ferdinand Magellan to set off on an adventure that resulted in the circumnavigation of the world. This work is an original piece by Veto Grillasca, using Procreate and After Effects, inspired by the story of the Italian sailor Antonio Pigafetta, who chronicled this great expedition. This piece is exhibited on page 190 of the book \"Relaci√≥n del primer viaje alrededor del mundo (1519-1522)\", published by Minerva Editorial (2022).\nWhen the collector acquires this piece, they will receive one of the 50 limited edition books signed by the artist, a printable file of the work in high resolution, as well as a certificate declaring them a friend of Minerva Editorial.",
