    "description": "What bothers me when we look at the sky is that I look to the past.\nStars have flashed and sent messages millions of light years ago, and we receive it too late.\nWorse, we are not able to understand their message with all these delays.\nWhat language does the universe speak?\nWhat makes the stars drunk? Which has caused them to set themselves on fire and are busy lighting the universe until they no longer have light.\nI wish I could hear the song that made the stars dance forever.\nI decided to take a mirror to the sky to hear the songs of the stars.\nThe collector will get the original JPG file in 5472 * 3648 pixel.\n",
