    "description": "Life is intangible but it can be touched or could be feel through emotions, feelings of humanity. I captured the faces and different phases of life. Sometime I saw life in child, sometime in adult and sometime in old person. Life can't be seen in actual but it could be seen in human faces. From child to older, poverty to prosperity, failures to success, sadness to happiness. Even loneliness, gatherings, sickness and healthiness, rejection and acceptance, even in the perspective of all relations like son, daughter, mother, father, brother, sister, husband, wife, friend etc, everything is life. In this picture, I captured children, elders and old persons from different areas and ethnicity of Pakistan also the refugees from the neighbour country Afghanistan to feel life in wider picture.\n\nResolution  9000 * 11864  ",
