    "description": "Aphrodite/Venus (Αφροδίτη) was goddess of love, beauty, pleasure and procreation in Greek mythology. She was the wellspring of both homosexual and heterosexual erotic desire as well as being known for her generously nurturing and passionately destructive persona.\n\nAphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her, but also punished those who disrespected her, often quite brutally.\n\nNow she is standing there. In melancholy, watching the storm coming towards her. The Descent of a goddess.\n\nJPEG 6000x4000\n300 DPI\nCaptured back on the 3rd of August 2018",
