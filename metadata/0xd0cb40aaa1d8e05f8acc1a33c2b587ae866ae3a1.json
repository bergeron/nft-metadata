The much famed water transport in Kashmir is dependent on Yaarbals for loading and unloading their goods and passengers. \nThe Yaarbals are also used for bathing and laundering purposes and are frequented by people, especially womenfolk, for a variety of reasons, so it became a hub for social discourse and exchange of ideas to soothen the mind and soul.",
