    "description": "Behind the eyes there is so much more that goes on inside the mind. Mind is always racing filled with demons, dark voices, and the urge to figure out a way to change and grow. Such a day to day battle, but each step towards the light is something im grateful even on the days I take ten steps backwards.\nLove you\nSteven Rea\n(BRAiN VOMiT)",
