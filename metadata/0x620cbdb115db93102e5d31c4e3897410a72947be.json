    "description": "She had been very exhausted over the past years and spontaneously decided to go alone to another city to rest and get her thoughts in order. Sometimes we think it's a great way to run away from our problems... but you can't run away from them.\nAnd she couldn't.\n\nShe has everything, but she feels very alone. She loves the quiet, the sadness, and the night. She feels comfortable at night because she is visited by many thoughts, beautiful and not so beautiful, during this magical time.\n\nNight comes for everyone to be themselves.",
