    "description": "Jimi Hendrix by The Postman. Artist duo THE POSTMAN formed in Brighton in 2018. Music, film and urban culture permeate their works which can be found on the streets all around the world. Their temporary pieces are not owned by anybody which adds to the allure with The Postman’s fans who enthusiastically seek them out before they disappear. This is the first ever NFT created by the Postman.\n\nThe photograph used to create this artwork was originally curated and commissioned by LostShoots as part of ‘Frame 69’ - a collaborative NFT project with multiple artists.  \nThe same single frame (film negative #69) from the 1967 shoot between photographer Donald Silverstein & musician Jimi Hendrix has been licensed to each artist taking part, with kind permission of the Silverstein Family Estate.  \nEach artwork within ‘Frame 69’ is a new 1/1 artwork, minted on the artists own smart contract, and curated by Lost Shoots / Matt Humphrey.\n\nOriginal photograph © Donald Silverstein / The Silverstein Family Estate.

The license includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder.  \nProvides no commercial rights.  \nProvides no editorial rights.\n\nContact: lostshoots@gmail.com  \nTwitter:  \n@LostShoots",
