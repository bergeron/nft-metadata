    "description": "HOLOTOPIA is a group of designers, artists, producers, and developers who support UN Sustainable Development Goals, and are seeking to educate other creators and consumers in order to drive change through sustainability, transparency, and accountability in virtual and physical fashion creation and consumption.\n\nOur mission is to onboard one million creators into a conscious design and collaboration community.\n\nFashion is a leading contributor to climate change. Unethical practices across supply chains and the lack of waste management directly impact the environment, the mental health of the consumer, and the physical health of emerging nations. The industry has a once-in-history opportunity to demonstrate that creativity and respect for boundaries can lead to authentic sustainability through Web3 technology and a new circular economy.\n\nThis hoodie is made from virtual textiles inspired by bio-based fibers that do not rely on animals or petrochemicals to create its luxurious feel. New revolutionary materials require less land and water than traditional wool, cashmere, or cotton.",
