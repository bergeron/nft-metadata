    "description": "A distinct chapter taken from The Pit (duration 15 minutes). The Pit is a film for endless loop created from gopro footage (2014, creative commons) treated & rendered in 4 layers of Sierra Lite in discordant resolutions. Order is figurative; emerging from asymmetric dither. A comment on the source film reads \"reminds me how to move in chaos”. The Pit was originally created to match the pixel pitch on LED curtain, adorning the walls on the approach to the LUCKYME® office in Edinburgh's Summer Hall. All 9 chapters change in both score and dominant resolutions, responding to time stamped comments on the source film. No one was harmed in the making of The Pit. \n\nOriginal sound by the artist. Each chapter (1/1) comes with link to full film (1/10) in prores at 4K 48gb & full soundtrack. The MP4 on-chain suffers compression not present in the full 4K film you receive. \"Everyone is smiling\". \n\nCreated by Dominic Kedzlie Flannigan: founder of LUCKYME®\n",
