    "description": "March 2020 in Egypt just before the curfew announced by the Egyptian president. My wife and I went on vacation and spent a few days in Sahl Hasheesh on the Red Sea in Egypt.\n\n \n\nThe trip turned into something unexpected, and we didn't get home until 10 weeks later than planned.\n\n \n\nIt was March 12, 2020 when this huge storm passed over the Red Sea and later on over Cairo. It's not really common for Egypt to have a severe storm with high winds and lots of rain over a few days.\n\n \n\nI took the camera, went down to the beach, was alone and took a series of long exposure shots. The weather was miserable, but somehow I was completely relaxed and calm as I took the pictures.\n\n \n\nThe sea was wild and angry, and my wife said you're crazy to go out in this weather, but when I showed her the pictures afterwards, she understood why I had gone out, and she was also completely calm.\n\n \n\nThat's why I named the series \"Calmness.\"    Enjoy it and all will be well again one day.  \n\nChristian Redermayer\n\nBe unique with your piece of art",
