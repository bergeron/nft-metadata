    "description": "I've often asked myself what's the difference between me and others. Or what is different between you and me? We are under the same Sun. We have hands, legs and head. We breathe the same air, we are born and die. We have freedom of choice. And choice makes us different. The choice is significant, decisive and the only important for everyone. Only you choose who you are, what you eat, where to go and in what you believe.",
