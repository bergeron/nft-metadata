    "description": "While wandering along the freight lines outside of Frisco I came to an imposing tunnel which I decided to hike into. The smell of death was strong and pungent as I went deeper into the abyss, it was like some creature had a lair deep within the tunnel. There were some unusual spooky sounds, and then unfortunately I saw the light of a freight approaching the tunnel when I wasn't even halfway through. I couldn't tell what track it was on and there wasn't clearance on either side, so I started running towards the entrance away from the oncoming train. I ran for my life with the horn blaring from the freight as they started to brake, but those things take a while to stop.  I frantically looked back over my shoulder while sprinting but still couldn't make out which track the goliath machine was on. Since I wasn't in great shape, I did my best and just barely made it out of the tunnel and bailed to the side of the tracks right before the freight came rumbling and screeching by. ",
