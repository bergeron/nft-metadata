    "description": "The abstract painting â€žescape to the better world\" arouses feelings of optimism and longing. The picture has a dreamlike, ethereal look due to the use of soft pastel hues. There is no obvious focal point in the piece, which is a whirling mixture of shapes and forms. The different colors and textures on the canvas lead the viewer's eye across the piece. The picture seems to be tempting the observer to go to a better world thanks to the tranquil and calm pastel colors. The loose, expressive brushstrokes give the painting a sense of movement and vitality. The peace and promise of greater things beyond the painting are the overall effects.",
