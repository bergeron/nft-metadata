    "description": "The rough textures of this particular salt pond are what caught my attention. The dark cracked corner and what looks like a stitch coming off the ‘bones’. After photographing this salt pond, it instantly reminded me of the vertebrae of a human spine. This is what inspired the title of this piece. I’ve also been told that it reminds some people of teeth! One thing I love about capturing these kinds of images is that each person has their own interpretation of what they see. \n\n\nBONES is a collection of 3 drone photos captured at a salt farm in Western Australia. These images are inspired by the connection to Mother Earth and how it can reflect parts of the human body. Each of these images have been captured with their natural colour which is caused by the different levels of salt and algae in the water. Microorganisms and increased salt change their hues. The ‘bones’ in these images are broken sand walls which are there to seperate the different ponds. ",
