    "description": "Each NFT comes with a signed and numbered first edition photographic print (shipment to any country in the world included)!\n\nThe moments and textures of the charismatic and unbelievably filmic Ukrainian city of Odesa, positioned on the south of the country on the Black Sea. Shot in 2019, on my second visit to the city.\n\nAll profits from the entire collection will go to support the local personally hand-picked charities that deal with the defence of the cities, bomb-shelter supplies and local population support in Ukraine.\nI will be personally monitoring the use of the funds and the transfer of the goods and services to the people in need. The updates will be shared on my Twitter.\n\nxx\nEdgar",
