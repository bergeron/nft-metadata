Esther's artistic canvas is digital. With the computer as main medium, she looks for so-called digital errors ; beauty flaws that contain a powerful aesthetic. It results in animations, projections and colorful visuals where geometry, deformation and evolution go hand in hand.\n\nTOYKYO  www.toykyo.be \n\nToykyo is a multidisciplinary design studio based in Ghent, BE. The studio was founded in 2006, born from a shared passion for striking visual culture. ‘We believe that creativity, optimism & originality are key elements in life and we apply the same philosophy to our designs. As image-makers, we enjoy navigating the blurred lines between graphic design, illustration and set design. We aim to evolve, transform and transcend.’\n\nFor more information or details: \ninfo@thewunderwall.xyz or info@plus-one.be",
