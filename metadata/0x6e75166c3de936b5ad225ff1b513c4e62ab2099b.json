    "description": "My first limited edition on ETH, 11 editions set at 0.11E each.\n\nThis work coincides with the title of my solo show in London at JG Contemporary, opening 7th September 2023.\n\nAn exploration of the space between physical and digital art, the show will consist of large scale physical paintings and a few surprises...\n\nRunning up to the show, holders of this piece will receive 11% discount on current minted pieces (outside of Worlds/Spaces contracts) and available physical work outside of gallery representation. Discount can be applied the night the show opens to pieces that are unveiled within.\n\nHolders will also receive an airdrop to the wallet the work is held in on 8th September 2023, representative of the previous evening if they weren't able to attend.\n\nA group chat will be opened on Twitter for those who would like to enter, with sneak previews and BTS footage/concepts.\n\nDigital texture, abstract photography, layering and pixel manipulation.  \n4200x5636px at 300dpi. \n\nJ-A ",
