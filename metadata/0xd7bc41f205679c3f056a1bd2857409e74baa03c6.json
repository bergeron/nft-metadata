    "description": "One of the most successful tools against COVID-19 has been testing. That testing had to be done through protective glass at the Gazi University Hospital in Ankara, Turkey. It was a grueling job for the healthcare professional taking the samples with temperatures soaring inside the little glass enclosure. Being stuck with heavy PPE gear inside a hot glass enclosure was a helpless feeling, which in a way was symbolic of what people felt all around the world with lockdowns.  \n\nBecause of the symbolism, to me, this photo will forever be a portrait of a doctor and humanity during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nF.
