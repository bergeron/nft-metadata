    "description": "I am very glad to present my Genesis here. I wanted to make something special, so it was take some time (almost 1 year, haha).\n\nThe sky surrounds us throughout our live, makes us calm,  fascinated and inspired to do great things. \nWhen there are pandemics and wars around, the beauty of nature will lead you to gather your thoughts and come to peace of mind.\n\nTo create this art, a lot of interval photos were taken and stitched into a 360Â° timestack panorama, then it was reflected several times and distorted with the help of metaverse magic.  Fullsize 15000x30000px.\n\nIt's like someone is drawing with a some cloudy brush across the sky.. Hope you enjoy it! \n\nAs ever,\nfotowizard.eth\n\n",
