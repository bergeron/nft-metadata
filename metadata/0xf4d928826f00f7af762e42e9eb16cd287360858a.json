    "description": "\"What is an example of a anomaly?\nAn anomaly is an abnormality, a blip on the screen of life that doesn't fit with the rest of the pattern. If you are a breeder of black dogs and one puppy comes out pink, that puppy is an anomaly.\"\n\nHumanity is at precipice: its future is at stake. We are moving in the wrong direction, we should turn back before it's too late. ..What is real, who can reveal.. Confusion decrease my sight... Do I wake up each day or dream in dismay... Are real people walking my way... Totally lost the purpose is done... Life and my dreams are now one... \" By Louis Cecile . Mixed-media  dystopian surreal visual art. Combination of traditional graphic art, photo collage and digital drawing. 1/1 #nft art.",
