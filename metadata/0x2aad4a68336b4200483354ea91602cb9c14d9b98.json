    "description": "This photograph was taken in a hospital on the outskirts of St_Petersbourg. In December 1998, I found an article in one of the provincial newspapers: â€œDoctors treat drug addicts by surgical cure\". Are we back to the medical experience of the Russians from the times of the Soviet Union? The next day I was in St-Petersbourg. It was very difficult to convince Dr Sviatoslav Medvedev, director of St Petersburg's Institute of the Human Brain but I finally got into the operating room and managed to take the picture I wanted. \nDuring this operation, doctors use a specially designed steel frame to plan the operation and approximately one cubic millimeter of tissue is removed from each hemisphere of the brain that is thought to control addiction, under local anesthesia. These surgeries, which the Western medical world rejected for ethical and medical reasons, were banned a few years later. My photograph remained like a movie scene and is now perhaps the only visual proof of that period!",
