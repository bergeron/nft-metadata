    "description": "Niet Genoeg is that special hype song that opened doors and continues to open doors for me far beyond the borders.\n\nThe song lyrics are in English, French and Dutch. I was born in Senegal - Africa grew up in the Netherlands on a lot of American music. All these influences are a big part of me and play a big part in where I’m at right now and in this particular song I'm just having fun mixing these different languages and musical influences into a dark/ethereal yet euphoric and hype International record. \n\n“Niet genoeg” means “Not enough”. To me, this means that I can always grow, learn and always take on the responsibility to be better. I could never consciously decide to stop creating or progressing, and I know all of y'all artists out there can relate.\n\nThe video was shot by Eloi du Cinema who in a sense kickstarted to what Luca and I got going on with our movement #CurrencyExchange today. The song is at 1.2 million on Spotify and 41K on youtube, but most importantly, it was the beginning of a chain reaction that resulted to me being in Web3 right now.\n\nProduced by: Barttelini \n\n- HOLDERS RECEIVE\n> Unreleased music and videos as well as reserved spots in the next merch drop \n\n",
