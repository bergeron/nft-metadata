    "name": "Boudicca, Warrior Queen",
    "description": "Boudicca is modelled after the stunning Florence Welch, who embodies the fierce spirit & strength of the ancient Celtic warrior who led a rebellion against the Romans almost 2000 years ago.  The main work is a digital oil painting, including the crow that was made separately. As well, photography elements are present: specifically the head piece and feathers hanging from her right ear are photographs I took of my own pieces of jewelry. Finally, some digital elements all come together to create this beautiful representation of Boudicca / Boadicea  with special thanks to Florence Welch. ",
