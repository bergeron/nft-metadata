    "description": "In „Autrhority Can Appear As A Cosmic Nebula’ the light sensitive material of a 4x5 negative film was exposed through the usage of an electric shock weapon. The Taser X26 is the most used model worldwide by authorities and legal forces, because of that it is changing police work radically in the last years. On one hand the work symbolises a latent state of violence and aggression and with it a possible critical and political way of reading, on the other hand there is the possibility to read it as strictly formalistic work, immersing into the examination of abstraction and exaggerating the aestheticization of violence so familiar to \"socially engaged\" contemporary art.\n\nThe work was produced in collaboration with Jonathan Fuss.",
