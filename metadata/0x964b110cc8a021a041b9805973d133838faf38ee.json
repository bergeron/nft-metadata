    "description": "This painting means a lot to me as it always reminds me of my journey. Been bullied a lot in elementary school as a kid for being tiny and used to be made fun of by my high school biology teacher in front of the whole class for being skinny, referring to me as \"malnutritioned\". That's when I decided to change my lazy and boring lifestyle all around, and not be that tiny lazy kid who gets made fun of. My goal was to prove those people wrong and show them the talent that I have. I joined a boxing and mma gym  and eventually started competing. That's when I started being a lot more confident and standing up for bullied people. I also started utilizing my artistic talent by doing acrylic paintings and digital illustrations and started learning photography. All this was done while pursuing my engineering career and during my studies. My main goal was to show people that no matter how anyone tries to belittle you, you can always prove them wrong and to never lose focus of your talent. Mu",
