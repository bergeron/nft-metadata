    "description": "My first ever photo as a photographer and i was so so proud with the way this came out. Fast forward a few months and here we are minting it as an NFT\n\nThis piece means a lot to met because not only was it my first photo but it takes me back to a time i was suffering quite badly with depression and all i wanted to do was be creative\n\nI intend to donate 50% of any earnings from this NFT to support like minded individuals who also struggle mentally ",
