    "description": "Cactus: The Rising\nCreated by NTOLPG\n\n1920x1920\n\nThe beginning of my first ever NFT collection. Inspired by Bauhaus era of architecture which had a utopian aim to create a radically new form of architecture and design to help rebuild society after the ravages of World War I. \n\nThis collection will be focusing on organic life that is encapsulated in megalithic concrete structures. Capturing the essence of life, or little that's left of it in a minimalist fashion to highlight key elements of a certain architectural period in time.",
