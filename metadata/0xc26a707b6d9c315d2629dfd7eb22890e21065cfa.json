    "description": "Skulls by SENTIENT is a collection of slow-art that confronts our most elusive resource, time, by revealing the digital series gradually over a period of 666 days. The series invites us to reflect on our mortality, face our inevitable death, and cherish each moment of each day, one limited edition art drop at a time. \n\nMinting or collecting each day’s skull unlocks FREE minting of the next drop in the sequence, allowing collectors to continue their journey through the series at no additional minting cost. \n\nThe minting is not available to the public. Only allow-listed collectors can partake. By holding any skull from the collection on any given day, one will be allow-listed automatically. There will be additional allow-list opportunities through community collaborations. \n\nThe edition size for each drop is dynamically set based on the number of eligible collectors who mint on the day.\n\nOfficial Skulls website: \nhttps://www.sentientskulls.xyz/\n\nOther projects by SΞNTIΞNT: \nhttps://www.sentient.gallery/  \n",
