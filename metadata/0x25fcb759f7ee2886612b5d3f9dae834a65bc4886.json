    "description": "When I was a little girl I liked to enter my parents' room and just sit there when they weren't at home. It felt like by looking at their room, just being there I'll be closer to them then I am when I am physically with them.\nYears passed, they got divorced. I haven't seen my mother in 5 years when I was a teenager. Now we are together again but it still feels like she is a stranger. I enter her room, she just left.\nThe sun shining through the window is warm, but my memories are cold.\nCan I get close to her? Probably not.\n\nFebruary 2020\nMinolta SRT MC-II, Kodak Vision III 250D",
