    "description": "A rainy night\nA trip on the bus from East to Central London\nI was lost in my thoughts\nReality started becoming an infinite loop\n\n\"London Night Bus\" is a real and imaginary journey in my unconscious and a sort of tribute to the city that has deeply marked my life path.\nThe Polaroids of this series were taken on the bus's upper floor during a night journey from East to Central London. They remained in the drawer of my memory, until I had an enlightenment.\nI took back those photos and left them immersed in peroxide for several days.\nI documented the film changes in contact with the chemists and then, I realised a mini video to obtain a mutation effect; by the way, transformation is then one of the concepts at the base of my works\nThe results are endless loops where the image turns to return to the initial state, with the background noise that brings me back to that night. \n",
