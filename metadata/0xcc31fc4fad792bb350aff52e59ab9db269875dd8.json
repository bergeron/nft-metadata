    "description": "Tabas County is located west of South Khorasan Province and is the mine capital of Iran. This region is home to numerous coal mines, wherein miners struggle and dig for coal under excruciating conditions, 350m below ground level, for 15 hours and 15 days of non-stop work, in three shifts, for a meager $250 a month. The health and safety of miners is constantly threatened by toxic gases, coal dust, dusty air, and the risk of mine collapse; and gradually they begin to suffer the consequences of permanent underground work, such as respiratory problems, herniated disc, and mental depression.
