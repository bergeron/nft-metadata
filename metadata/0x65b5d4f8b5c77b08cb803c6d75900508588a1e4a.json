    "description": "The legendary Josie Bellini joins as our guest for the very first episode of the Dankness! Josie is well known for her early genre-defining work as a CryptoArtist including such iconic pieces as her 2018 paintings Filter and Acceptance. Josie is also known to  NFT collectors around the world as the dynamic and innovative CEO and Founder behind the wildly successful CyberBrokers - A first-of-its-kind digital art collectibles ecosystem centered around 10,001 unique and on-chain NFTs. \n\nIn this episode, Josie and Artnome get into a debate about the metaverse (is it cool or does it kinda suck?) and find common ground in their atypical religious upbringings. Josie later opens up sharing a really heartfelt story about one of her community members (our favorite part of this episode). She’s as real as it gets, and that is why we’ve picked her out of 8 billion people in the world to be our first guest! \n\nAs a bonus, the legendary ROBNESS joins us to share a deep cut about the origins of trash art. One of the only artists involved in the CryptoArt movement since its inception, ROBNESS  has worked across chains and genres since the early Rare Pepe days. DOES HE SPEAK IN ALL CAPS? Listen to find out.\n\nYou should absolutely follow our guests on Twitter at @josiebellini and @ROBNESSOFFICIAL. \n\nTo keep up with the podcast follow @thedanknessxyz on Twitter. Sickles is on Twitter at @dan_sickles and you can keep up with his amazing documentary at @newherexyz as it evolves. Artnome lives on Twitter at @artnome and his company ClubNFT, which helps collectors protect and discover NFTs, is at @club_nft.",
