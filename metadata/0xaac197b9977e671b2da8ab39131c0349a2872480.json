    "description": "The two-tailed cat ”Nekomata” is a yokai that originated from a long-lived domestic cat's transformation.\nThe nine-tailed fox is also a yokai known in China and other Asian countries.\nBoth of them have been beloved in Japan since ancient times.\nAfter people have gone to sleep, the two yokai engage in a duel on the rooftops of the town.\nTheir weapons are only musical instruments! It's a battle of sound.\n\n*The artwork incorporates some modified ukiyo-e prints from the Edo period as the background.\nWe are striving to create \"New Ukiyo-e\" \nwhile cherishing the essence of traditional Ukiyo-e, \nwe want to spread the fun and new charm of its to the  world!",
