    "description": "COYA celebrates its 10 year anniversary inviting a selection of international artists to create an NFT of their choice.\n\nWhen asked by Coya to create an NFT my mind simultaneously returned to the land from which Coya hails and its Latin American spirit to the Middle East where I have spent many years living and working. I recalled my experiences and my memories of both cultures and both countries and began to formulate an expression of both these, expressed in tandem, yet each very individual.\n\nAs a fine art artist all my NFT's have a physical component bridging the gap between the Physical and digital world. This one of one NFT comes with Utilities such as the augmentation video and  a physical wall hanging. \n\nSimon Mc Nally\n\n\n",
