    "description": "[#003 Vintage Store Owner]\nThe shop owner is a keen observer of people.\nHe seems to be trying to pinpoint the needs of the customers.\n\nAlthough he seems a bit arrogant, he is kind and explains everything well. \nHowever, he doesn't enjoy being noticed inside or outside the store.\n\nHe moves fast and seems to be diligent. Also, his dress is always clean. \n\nThere must be someone like him around you.\n\n--\n[247DIFF INTRODUCTION]\nNo one lives the same life or time.\nThey are all connected, having completely different and unique stories of their own.\n\nPlease stay tuned and see how they will be connected, just like the idea of Six degrees of separation; all people are six or fewer social connections away from each other.\n\nMeet your neighbours in Metaverse and also in reality.\u0003You'll be able to see someone like me, someone like you or your friends.\n\nEvery moment we live a different life.\n\nTwenty-four Seven.",
