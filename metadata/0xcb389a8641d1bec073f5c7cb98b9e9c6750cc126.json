    "description": "\"Purgatory of Venus\" was inspired by my older artwork, \"Sweet purgatory\", but this time the elements of beauty are hidden in the world's ugliness. Its primary focus is to make the viewer feel suffocated, trapped, and helpless. As you go from top to bottom, you notice how the persons trapped inside found \"peace\" and abandoned all hope to escape, finding beauty and calmness in the worst possible outcome.\n\n4000x5000 hand-drawn in Photoshop.",
