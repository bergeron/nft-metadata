    "name": "Finding Keanu",
    "description": "\"When the people you love are gone, you're alone.\"\n\nTo answer the Fremens' urgent call for support to planet Arrakis, Keanu Reeves quickly leaves his ornithopter over the dunes and begins to follow his feelings as he jumps into his legendary Arch Method 143. He had received some warnings that his close friend Duncan Idaho had told him about, that's why he took a drone with him, but he never expected that he would encounter something like this. \n\nApart from never encountering such a large statue before, he found something of his own in the depths of his memory. Was it Neo that came to mind? Or was it Johnny Silverhand or John Wick? It's a struggle for existence.\n\nWhy did I include him in my art? Because, his random acts of kindness include secretly donating large sums of money to children's hospitals. And many more... Keanu Reeves is a great person. A very different actor. We call him a \"respectful king\" and praised him for being considerate and respectful.",
