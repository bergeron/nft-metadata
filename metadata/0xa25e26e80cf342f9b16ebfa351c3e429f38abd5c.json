    "description": "In the first piece of the \"Algorithmic Feelings\" series, I visualized the emotion of sorrow with parametric algorithms and manipulation of patterns.\n\n“Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that fresh, green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up the rotten roots, so that new roots hidden beneath have room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things will take their place.”\n\nThe dark and light is in a balance and by letting go, letting sorrow be, joy can reborn again. Everything flows and find its way. This order creates beauty.",
