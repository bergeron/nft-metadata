    "description": "We are the Bored Brothers. A fully animated NFT-based recording artist project developed and executive produced by Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic) and KYGO. As avid NFT / Web3 enthusiasts, we conceived the idea of auditioning some of our Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) apes to form an animated, multi-genre duo based primarily in dance and hip-hop. This project stems from an overwhelming desire to curate and create music outside our respective genres.",
