    "description": "I've lived in this world for 43 years. \nI remember many shameful events from coups in my country to wars between countries, from civil wars to massacres. I‚Äôve always kept my hope of leaving a more livable world to our children.\nI still have hope 'cause I'm still alive.\nIn this series, I show the world these embarrassing scenes I remember from an old black and white TV screen.\nAt the same time, I will try to explain the events in the world social history in my other works.\nThe first item of the collection is about the war in occupied Ukraine.\n\n*I'll collect works by one or more artists with half of the eth from the sale of the first itemü§ù artists will be artists we've never met face to face.\n",
