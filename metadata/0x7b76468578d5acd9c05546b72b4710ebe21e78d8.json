    "description": "Addiction is a universal experience, affecting people in different ways and to varying degrees. Whether it is full-blown addiction to drugs or alcohol, or a more subtle addiction to social media, food, or shopping, we all have some sort of addiction in our lives. \n\nAs an artist, it's rare to come across an image that immediately catches your attention and inspires you to act. But with this piece, that's exactly what happened. The moment I saw it, I knew I had to finish it instead of deleting it or putting it on the back burner. There was something about the image that spoke to me, something that felt right and deeply familiar. To me, this art sends a powerful message about the human experience. \n\nPrompt, art curation, and post production all designed by Dark and Dark. \n\nMp4 size 1080 x 1920\n",
