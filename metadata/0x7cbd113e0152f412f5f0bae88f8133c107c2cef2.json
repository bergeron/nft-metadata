    "description": "This world lies about 12 million light-years away. We look 12 million years into the past. The dinosaurs on our planet were extinct long ago, and mammals ruled the Earth. Still, it was 10 million years before the first Homo evolved. But from the galactical perspective, these worlds are our close neighbours.\n\nThese two galaxies interact gravitationally, stealing and throwing matter into the void between them. Some of that matter falls back and feeds unusual star borning activity, especially in the Cigar Galaxy.\n\nThis two hours-long (integrated) photo was captured about 30 miles from London, further away from the city's light pollution, during a cold and windy winter night in February 2022.\n\nImaged using Altair 183C camera, SkyWatcher 150PDS telescope on the EQ3 mount, guided. 24 frames 5 minutes each. Stacked in APP and post-processed in GIMP.",
