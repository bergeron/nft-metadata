The collection is released via the Physital NFT Art Gallery, adding yet more lush and psychedelic art to this epicenter of naturalistic NFT art. These flowers will then act as the centerpiece collection that will offer the possibility to claim a physical medium of high-quality print. Three unique NFTs will have one free claim!"
