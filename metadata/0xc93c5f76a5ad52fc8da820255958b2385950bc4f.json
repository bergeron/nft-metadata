    "name": "52 Hertz  the tone of loneliness",
    "description": "Whales normally make sounds between 12 and 25 hertz, while this song was sung at 52 hertz. Oceanologists first thought this whale was deaf. After more than 20 years of research and data, they decided that the whale was not deaf. Loneliness was the main reason why the whale sang at 52 hertz. Since the other whales could not hear this high frequency sound, they did not respond to it at all.\n52 Hertz The Tone of Loneliness, visualized with the science of Cymatics, focuses on the loneliness of modern people in the existential pains of today's world, offering not only a visual but also an auditory catharsis.",
