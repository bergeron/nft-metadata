    "description": "Sunset was about to come when I decided I want a shot of the sunset and the ocean. I was walking along a bridge when I notice the reflection of the sunâ€™s light into the ocean. Just beneath the bridge, I saw a man trying to cross the other side of the ocean, towards a platform where he can stow his boat. I knew he was going to come across the light reflection so I waited patiently until he was properly placed in the scene. I had a vision in my mind and I took multiple shots as he headed towards the other side.",
