    "description": "My name is Butch‚Ä¶I produce under the name OddKidOut. I‚Äôve been making music my whole life, and I tend to have the most fun when I‚Äôm blending genres together or just making weird shit. I made this song at 5 in the morning. I had three homies over who all fell asleep on the couch in my studio, so I was producing with the volume super low (I usually have it cranked all the way the fuck up). I think the mood of the song came from the feeling of producing in that environment; dark, stealthy and ambient. I realized the next day when I listened back to the track, that it needed some vocals to tie it all together. I sat and thought about some artists I thought would work well, but my mom called me in the middle of my brainstorming session. We chatted for a while and she was fake singing walking around the house, and it sparked an idea. What if I sampled my mom? She‚Äôs my best friend and her voice is quite good, so I made her take a selfie video singing some words I thought would fit the track ‚ÄúWHAT ABOUT ME?‚Äù. She sent the video to me and 30 minutes later, I had sampled it and made the track you‚Äôre all hearing today ü§òüèº",
