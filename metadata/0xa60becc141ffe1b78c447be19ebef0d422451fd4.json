    "description": "The Matterhorn Mountain in Switzerland, Zermatt\n\nOne Mountain - 16 different edits\n\nThe Matterhorn, which rises to a height of 4478 meters, is seen at the end of the Matter valley in the heart of the Valais Alps. It is stunning and unmistakable, precisely shaped like an Egyptian pyramid. And yet, it was once a part of the African continent millions of years agoâ€”a fact that is difficult to believe. It is currently one of the most recognizable mountains in the world and the most recognized representation of Switzerland due to extensive continental drift.\n\nWhen the summit was first conquered in 1865, knowledge of the achievement spread fast throughout the world, and the Matterhorn became legendary. The summit, which is more than 4000 meters high and was originally thought to be insurmountable, still attracts climbers more than 150 years later.",
