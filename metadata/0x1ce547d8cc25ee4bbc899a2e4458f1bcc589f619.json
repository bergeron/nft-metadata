    "description": "In 2013, my album OUT OF THE BLACK was released. \nIn celebration of 10 years, I am releasing this unreleased song „Vocode“. \n\n„Vocode“ was a track I made during the „Out Of The Black“ album process, you can hear similarities to „Rocky 2“ or „Touch It“ and it’s got that banging vibe from my classic „& Down“. \nI played it out in clubs in the early 10’s, but decided not to include it in the album. If you love the hard & funky sound from that time, here’s something special from the vaults that would have been lost to history. \nArtwork by Yoshiro Nishi.\n",
