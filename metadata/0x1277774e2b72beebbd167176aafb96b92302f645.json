    "description": "We planned to climb Mt. Rainier in 2020, but the trip was canceled because of COVID. After a year in quarantine, I wasnâ€™t in my best mountain climbing shape when we arrived at Mt. Rainier in July 2021. Unfortunately, I got sick on the way up the mountain and had to turn back. I was disappointed that we had failed to summit the mountain, but after some rest, I was feeling better and determined to enjoy the time we had at Mt. Rainier. On the last evening of the trip, we hiked to a fire lookout tower for sunset and stayed until the wee hours of the morning. One of my favorite things about this image is that if you look closely, you can see the headlamps of the climbers as they ascended the mountain towards the summit. This image was made by stacking eight 13-second shots for noise reduction and detail.",
