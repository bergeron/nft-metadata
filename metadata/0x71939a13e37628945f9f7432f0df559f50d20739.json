    "description": "“Wheel of Time” is the nature of everything and\neverything which exists is of the nature of cycles of time. \n\nOur ego self is the combination of our external universe and our internal being. Our true self though is this deepest absolute level, our sacred truth. Through practicing with our subtle body and mind, we are able to purify our perceptions an experiences, thus unveiling the path of the sun keepers. ",
