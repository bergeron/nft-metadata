    "description": "WNA KNOW\n~~~~~~~~\ncover art by Jah.\nproduction by Bradley Jughead Thomas\nwritten / performed by Manic Phase and Mariana Makwaia\nmixed / mastered by Manic Phase\n~~~\nWNA KNOW is the single and second track in a collaborative EP between Manic and Mari that explores themes of intimacy in the digital age. In our first session together, Manic pulled up this rnb fusion beat by grammy-nominated Jughead and we immediately started freestyling over it. We knew we wanted the main core of the song to be a question and when Mari hopped on the mic, the hook poured out. We finished the demo in our very first session together!\n\nThis song is about the struggles of modern-day relationships and the confused feelings that come up around love in a world where we're constantly connected but still feel isolated. Manic and Mari created alternate, slightly more toxic versions of themselves - two artists trying to navigate their personal and professional lives in the music industry. \n\nLooking forward: the full EP will be released on DSP's beginning of April, there will be an invite-only irl performance in LA and the tracks will soon be shopped around for syncs and licensing. \n~~~\nAll splits will be 25% for each collaborator",
