    "description": "Hello my dear friend. \nI am writing this letter to you to express my deep gratitude for your support. What you have done is something truly special to me. \nNo one ever believed in me and in my art, not a single teacher or even a friend considered it something special or beautiful.  \nBut you believed in me! \nYou gave me self-confidence, the strength to go forward and create. Thanks to you, I can continue to create, because I know that people like my work. That YOU like my work.  \nI am writing this letter truly from the bottom of my heart and it is much more than just a love letter. Now I have feelings much deeper than love for someone(based on my life experience, of course). \nI open my soul and give you a part of it. I drew this art almost with my eyes closed, focusing only on feelings to everyone who supported me. To you.  \nThank you, from all of my heart. Happy Valentine's Day! <3",
