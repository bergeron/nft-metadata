    "description": "All materials for the video are abstract plant and flower forms, stripe, and grid images generated by p5js.\nBy moving these images vertically in multiple layers and creating repetitive effects, the work explores the possibility of flatness between digital art and Gen art.\n\nThis work was minted for Crypto Art Fes 2022 to be held in Japan.\nThe year 2022 may be a difficult time for crypto and NFT, but such a Fes was held. I would like to note that many people are working hard to explore the possibilities of NFT and to create.\nThese are days full of envy & gratitude. haha\n\n#p5js #aftereffect",
