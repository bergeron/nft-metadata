    "description": "This is my first ever NFT.\n\nThis was painted at the beginning of our \"new normal.\" I thought it was slightly hilarious that people would mix up \"corvid\" and \"covid\" at the beginning of all this mess and wanted to show the proper respect to our harbingers of misfortune.\n\nThe collection will be #01-49 unique animated images from this painting. Each of these (#01-49) will be gifted 2% in ETH when the original painting sells (currently valued at 10 ETH.)\n\nEach time an NFT of #01-49 is resold, I will add 2 ETH to the price of the original painting.\n\nOriginal painting will be a a phygital product in the #00 slot and will not be listed until the collection sells out. First buyer of #00 will be sent the original painting once they have given an address for shipping.",
