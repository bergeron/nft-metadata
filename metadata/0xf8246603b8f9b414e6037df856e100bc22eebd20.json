    "description": "Lucid in Dreamland is an art collaboration between illustrator Lei Melendres with gravure model/photographer/cosplayer Natsuki Jiro. This is the first time he's ever created an artwork that has a slightly more mature content which he combines with his usual playful characters and elements.\n\nThe goal of the artist was to create a theme similar to Alice in Wonderland but with a psychedelic/trippy twist by showing what she was experiencing inside her head while having a really good trip.\n\nThe artist promises to create another piece to add to this collection every time a piece is sold until they reach a maximum of (12) artworks for the whole collaboration since Natsuki has already created several photos meant for the series.\n\nYou can check out \nLei Melendres at https://linktr.ee/leimelendres\nNatsuki Jiro's at https://linktr.ee/natsukijiro\n\nThank you for your support! More to come!",
