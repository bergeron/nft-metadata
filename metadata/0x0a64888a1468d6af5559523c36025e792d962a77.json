Friends or family will try to contact you. Answer them that you are doing well, and end the conversation as soon as possible. Then they won't be able to get to you.\n\n3. Communicate only with strangers and only online. They don't know anything about you and can't hurt you.\n\n4. Isolate yourself from the news and events of the outside world. If you break this rule, the consequences will be unpredictable. \n\n5. You can continue to work to sustain life, but only if this work does not violate the conditions of the previous points. \n\nAfter completing all the points, you are almost ready to enter the Abyss. When your access is open, the first thing to do is to turn off the lights. They can only withstand the cold glow of a monitor. \n\nStay in silence. Their auditory receptors are very sensitive.\n\nDo not turn around under any ci",
