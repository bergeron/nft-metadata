    "description": "Knightlife\n\nDuring my road trip through Scotland, I passed many old castles and ruins. I spent a lot of time behind the wheel and tried to imagine the problems people had to deal with back then.  \nClan fights, wars, diseases. No wonder people preferred to keep their distance from others and look for a safe place where they could be alone.  \nAfter a long time without internet and television, I'm back at home watching the news and realizing we're going back there again.  \nPeople still hate each other because of their race, old white men try to push the borders and invade their neighboring country, one pandemic is not over yet and the next one is already coming. \nI've never wanted to be remote like I do now.\n\nLocation: Scotland  \nYear: 2022\n\nEdition of 22",
