    "description": "I am living abroad for over 20 years but I took this photo some years ago when I was visiting my family in Poland on Christmas. Since I was a kid this time of a year was always something special for me, something magical, so when I saw my sister kid admiring the Christmas tree I knew I have to capture this moment.. and it felt almost like I would be doing a photo of myself when I was doing exactly the same when I was 10 years old.",
