    "description": "The beauty of Kenyaâ€™s wildlife is beyond description. It's not just the flamingos. We felt how beautiful animals are in their natural habitat. How beautiful the people are. Look at the giraffes, flamingos, zebras, antelopes, ostriches and Masai people that I managed to capture on this trip, as well as the most radiant girl in the world that I met in Kenya.\n\nBreathing is taken from the outside world. There is nothing more inspiring for me than animals. Thanks to them, I create my best art. The fabric waving and entangling everything around is what I like, so this is exactly what was reflected in these works.",
