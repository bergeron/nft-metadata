    "description": "The L1 NFT collection by Julius Lehniger consists of 30 different lamp designs. Each element is handmade and absolutely unique. The owner of an L1 NFT not only owns a unique piece of art but also the custom design itself, which can be availed as a physical neon lamp at an additional cost. All lamps can only be built once! If the owner does not claim the design, that specific design will never be built. Check out the L1 NFT collection of 30 unique designs and pick your favorite. Find your style!",
