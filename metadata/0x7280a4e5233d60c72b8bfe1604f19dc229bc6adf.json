    "description": "This is a collection of infrared photographs taken under the theme “What you see is not the only truth”.\n\nIn reality, there are many difficult problems and things that make us want to turn away from them. However, we have to face such reality with courage. This \"fragment\" is proof that we continue to face such reality.\nLet's keep questioning reality and keep thinking to get better answers.\n\nWHAT IS INFRARED PHOTOGRAPHY?\nThis work is called infrared photography. Infrared photography is the use of a special camera to capture images in the infrared region that are invisible to the human eye. Please enjoy the fantastic scenery invisible to the human eye and the pleasant composition I have found.",
