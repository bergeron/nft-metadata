    "name": "PUTIN IS DEAD Cover by XANAX TBILISI single",
    "description": "XANAX TBILISI is a multimedia project created by musician Arseniy Morozov from Sonic Death, painter Alisa Yoffe and game designer Andrei Aranovich from orthodocs.eth. They met in Tbilisi after leaving Russia in the beginning of March 2022 due to their protest against the full scale invasion in Ukraine.\nThey are a VR music group with a political, anti-Putin and anti-war repertoire with own metaverse. For the construction of the vr-world used scans of several locations in Tbilisi.\nA first band’s single has become a statement that Putin Is Dead. In the middle of the track there is a Putin’s speech in German about the European integration, in which he tells about lessons of the Cold War and perniciousness of an occupation ideology.\nLaunching of the world will take place in November, so does the first band’s concert, where band members will perform as avatars.
