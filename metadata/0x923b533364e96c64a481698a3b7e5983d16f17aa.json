    "description": "The Garden is a digital and physical bouquet of floral portraits created by Christopher DeLorenzo. Hand-crafted by Christopher, these digital portraits are one-of-a-kind and exist as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. For each arrangement, Christopher will design and create a limited edition physical print, not included in the digital collection. When an arrangement sells out, holders can choose to claim and collect a physical artwork, signed by the artist.",
