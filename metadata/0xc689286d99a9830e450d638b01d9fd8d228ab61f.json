    "description": "This was my first time going out to shoot infrared on a cloudy day, and it went well! But when I got home to edit those shots, I felt terrible as I couldn't find a way to get the colors right.\n\nI found out what was the problem a few weeks later, I was stuck in an editing routine. So I took a step back to rethink the start of my editing workflow.\n\nSoon, I felt driven toward blue, and it was going to be my main color. I edited this image with a very peaceful and soft mood in mind.\n\nThis was perfect!\n\n\n// About\n\nArtist's name: Jonas | J0n45.eth\nCollection's name: 1R 7R335 - Another Light\nTitle: 4 N3W 574R7 (PronounceA New Start)\nEdition: 1/1\nLight Spectrum: 665 nm\n\nAvailability: NFT and Print (edition of 10)\nResolution: 5515 x 3677 px\nCoordinates: 46.528810, 6.211319\n",
