    "description": "I enjoy pursuing different genres of photography but Iâ€™ll always gravitate towards the mountains. This image was taken in the Dolomites, Italy and is the most impressive and dramatic mountainscape I have ever captured. The soft afternoon light combined with the juxtaposition between the vibrant autumn trees and the rugged, baron peaks makes it an absolute personal favourite.",
