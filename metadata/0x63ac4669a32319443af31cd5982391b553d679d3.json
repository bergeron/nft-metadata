    "description": "Sometimes a photograph looks more like a painting with the light, colors, and shadows in the image. One of my favorite things about photography is creating images that have more of a \"painting\" feel to them. I love to do this with abstract and macro images, and sometimes an entire scene can be captured this way. I have taken so many photos over the years at this lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, but on this night, the image had such a surreal and dreamlike feeling - I felt like I was sitting in front of a painting at a museum. I was so lost in this sunset as the world faded around me and I just sat in awe as watched the colors set over the calmest conditions I have ever seen here.  \n",
