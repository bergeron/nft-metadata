    "description": "Into the Unknown is a 3rd person adventure game created in Unreal Engine 5. \n\nYou are a young girl, who finds herself in this hyperreal dystopian space standing in front of a maze. You have to navigate through many twists and turns to find a way out to the other side. \n\nThe artwork is a metaphor on life itself. There are many levels and multitudes of paths to take. And to get to the next level, we must embark on a journey and plunge into the unknown. Standing still might seem safe, but inaction is a dead end. We must always find a way forward, even if our destination is not yet visible. \n\nThis NFT comes with the game file.",
