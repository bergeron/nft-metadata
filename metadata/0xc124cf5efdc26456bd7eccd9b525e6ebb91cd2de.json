    "description": "Rothko Transmission is a piece of animated, avant garde visual digital art.\n\nA print of Mark Rothko's Number 24 (Untitled), 1951 was found on the street, taken back to the artist's studio and hung on a wall. A digital photograph was taken of the print hanging in the room, and then that digital photograph was converted into sound and played back in the room. This sound was recorded and converted back into an image. Some of the original photograph image data was then re-introduced into the file, which was then converted back into an image again. The resulting animation is made of this second frame (with added image data), followed by the first frame (the plain audio transmission). ",
