    "description": "The first one of Metamotive Genesis Series, named \"PROTOTYPE\".\n\nIt inherits and pays homage to the golden age when people imagined future vehicles as a speed form - the wedge era in the 1970s. At that time, we had Lamborghini Countach, Lancia Stratos Zero, and DMC-12 from . Unfortunately, due to the worldwide oil crisis, it is difficult for us to see such a pure and symbolic \"car\" just flying close to the ground after that.\n\nNow with the launch of the Metamotive, ZEO extracted the most authentic and pure part of the wedge form and created this work. Before that, it had never been publicly displayed in any corner of the web2 world. So in the Web3 world, you can: enjoy it, drive it, and really have it.\n\nREAL 3D #0000 \"PROTOTYPE\" HERE: \n[#0000 \"PROTOTYPE\" Ã— ZEO](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/53255746381496994591028452363296430287011319116390215757749954809426291458049)",
