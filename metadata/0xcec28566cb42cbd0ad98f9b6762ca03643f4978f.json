    "description": "My works are the photos of people or objects in the real world, which I depict through the prism of my vision.\n\nThe starting point is usually a street photo from different parts of the world with post processing that brings a variety of associations, thoughts, ideas and feelings. I try to express everything that pops up in my mind while I’m looking at the photo by splashing all my emotions on it to show a parallel reality of these objects.\n\nAs a guide between our world and another reality, I see and depict what is not visible at first glance.\n\nIn each picture you will be able to see something of your own, a piece of yourself, your mood and mood of the subject that is transmitted through it.\n\nWhat we see in the first moment is not always a reality.\n\nWhat do you see in my works?\n\nPhoto was created in USA Seattle\nSize: 2685 × 3800",
