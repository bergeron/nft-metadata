    "description": "Alkenome Monsters(Alkemons) are characters that users themselves complete using cryptographic alchemy (AI art generation) on unfinished Alkemons. The title is a cross between Alchemy, Aruke (Walk in Japanese) and Genome , and the goal is to maintain healthy habits through walking. To this end, Alkenom Monsters uses a \"Move to Earn\" mechanism in which users earn tokens for walking and \"Public Commitment\" in which users are rewarded for continuing to do so. Another feature is content created with user participation using AI art. ALKEMON aims to help people have new healthy habits and live a fun and healthy life.",
