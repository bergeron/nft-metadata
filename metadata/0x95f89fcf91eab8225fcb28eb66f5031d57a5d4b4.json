    "description": "Rendezvous is set in a world of spacecraft ship-breaking and is a part of my ANKARIS Project. A long term oil painting project that will eventually be published as a large format book.\n\nThis ship-breaking activity spans the entire planet with communities living in and around the giant hulking wrecks. Communities grow and thrive out of the faded forgotten hulks, who's exploits and adventures are now long past. In this particular instance, a Monastery has been fashioned from old ship parts and now lies hidden deep in the mountains.\n\nLevitation - 46\" x 18\" (116cm x 46cm) Oil on linen. This is a full resolution scan of the original painting. You can see every brush stroke, brush hair, dust and mark. The file is 12,000 pixels across. \n\nThe first collector will receive a full 1:1 size, signed fine art print of the painting.\n\n---\nWayne Haag is a veteran film industry artist with 26 years of experience having worked on such films asThe Fifth Element, The Lord of the Rings, Superman Returns, The Wolverine, Maze Runner, Alien Covenant, Ghostbusters Afterlife, Foundation TV series and as of this minting, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0351770/",
