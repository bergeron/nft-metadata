Someone I consider my friend. \n\n\n\n\n\"All my motives and every single narrative below reflects  \nthat moment when it broke and will I never let it go  \nNo matter what? Now I am throwing all the shards away,  \ndiscarding every fragment, and fumbling uncertain towards a Curtain call  \nthat no one wants to happen,  \nthat no ones going to clap for at all, but that still has to be.\"",
