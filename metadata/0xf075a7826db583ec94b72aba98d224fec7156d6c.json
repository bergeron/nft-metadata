    "description": "May 5, 2010\n Italy, 00:00\n\nThat night city of Milan turned into Pandora: highest-grossing film of all time ‘Avatar’ was released on DVD and Blu-ray. First buyers of the Blu-ray received an original letter from 20th Century Fox H.E. containing the exclusive boarding pass for the flight to Pandora, produced in a limited edition of only 300 units.\nTogether with the pass was included an invitation to the “Avatar program\" which contributes to the preservation of the planet by adopting a tree planted in the name of Earth Day. A million will be planted.\n\nThis NFT will allow you to board the Pandora Airlines flight on May 5, 2054, at 6.30 pm. Owner may ask for the original letter with the boarding pass and the invitation.\n\nSee you on Pandora.",
