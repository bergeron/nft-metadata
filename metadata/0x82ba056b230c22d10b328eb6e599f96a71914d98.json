    "description": "Hi, I'm Arya and I'm an 8-year-old NFT creator and artist. \n\nWith this highly-detailed, high-resolution 1/1 art piece, I wanted to leave a mark on my NFT journey to celebrate being one of the official #NFTNYC2023 Artists.\n\nThis piece was all digitally hand-drawn from my imagination and illustrated on a single layer. I also inserted a few of my previous character designs into it. \n\nTogether, they celebrate the beauty of creating art, the friendship among artists & NFT community\n\nThe artwork has a resolution of 3000 x 2400 pixels and is 300 DPI.",
