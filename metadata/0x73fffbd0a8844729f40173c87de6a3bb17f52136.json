    "description": "Sometimes unidentified objects that serve no one and nothing, they evoke longing and inspiration... a universal idea that orders the world?\n\nToday, I'm no sure if I believe in the existence of an idea that orders the world. I see how everything I considered unchanging is slowly transforming. Fragments of reality that I once knew are gradually disappearing. Like faded photographs, they lose their contrasts and colors until they become unreadable. Through art, through the act of art itself, I strive to capture fleeting moments that may pass by. I gather them like precious stamps that Over time gain value - they will cease to be not dailies.",
