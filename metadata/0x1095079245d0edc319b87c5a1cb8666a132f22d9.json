    "description": "When the energy of two waves reflects and refracts, moments like 'Divide' are created. \n\nOne does not accidentally capture an image like this.\n\nSometimes years are spent chasing one fraction of a second. Travelling, searching, carrying bulky bags of camera equipment on and off planes, boats and helicopters, years of swimming with a camera in a waterproof housing - to seek out these moments of ephemerality.\n\nOce captured, this singular moment is then transformed into a mesmerizing moving image, detailing the oceanâ€™s myriad of colours and textures, as well as its immense power.",
