    "description": "Trolling is a photography NFT. Clicked in January 2022. In January 2022, there was lockdown imposed in India, in that phase I went to Srinagar of Jammu & Kashmir state in India. Temperature was freezing cold and I was just roaming near the Dal lake searching for minimal frames, love to capture minimalism. I saw this fisherman trolling alone in the middle of the Lake, in freezing cold fighting for his bread and butter. the background mountain was partly foggy, tried to include it in the frame too. This NFT is what I got after post processing in Adobe Lightroom for details and Color corrections.\n\nArtist- Akash Pratap Singh\nFormat- JPG\nEdition- 1/1\nDimension- 3816 x 4770\nISO- 100\nShutter Speed- 1/400\nFocal Length- f/7.1\n\nLicense: Primary NFT Holder is free to use in display private and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries & essays by the holder of NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
