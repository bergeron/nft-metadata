    "description": "After going through an awakening I found myself going back to my roots. I am slowly heading back towards my passion. A passion full of creativity, visions, and hope. I kept my emotions hidden for the longest time after encountering trauma at a young age. I am finally opening up to the world, giving it another chance. Another chance to live this beautiful life while I leave the bad memories behind. \n\nThis piece of art holds a special place inside of me. I enjoy walking late at night while I capture all the night wonders, but as a woman, we have to take serious precautions. It’s not that easy and can become frustrating, but mostly overwhelming. Sadly, it’s just the world we live in. After going through a traumatic situation while walking late at night, so much anger has grown in me. I almost lost myself, but I mostly really gave up.\n\nIt’s unbelievable how strong a human being can be. I could of let it destroy me, but I pushed through. This piece represents me overcoming what I most feared for so long. I am finally in control now.",
