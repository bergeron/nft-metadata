    "description": "Fri, Mar 25, 2022 - 18:28\n\nThe day before, we took a bullet train from Berlin to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a small town in the southern part of Germany, rented a cozy place for us, and spent our weekend amidst the German mountains. The whole scenery was stunning, we were surrounded by mountains. \n\nWe rented a car on the second day and drove to the Eibsee, a lake in Bavaria, Germany, just 9 km away from where we stayed. When we got there, the sun was just setting, and the lake was still frozen. The temperature was rather cool, but one could still feel a little bit of warmth from the setting sun. \n\nThe whole journey was tremendous, but it was only the beginning.\n\n\nLove,\nChisa\n\n2268 x 1512 px\n",
