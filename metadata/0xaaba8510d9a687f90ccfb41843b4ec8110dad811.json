    "description": "Humor in sadness. Ivory poaching is still a massive industry. Our goal is to create a fund to help conservationists protect elephant populations and follow through with prosecution. The 10% seller's fee will be used to create a shareholder fund to be distributed as the assets are divested. The longer you hold, the larger the return.",
