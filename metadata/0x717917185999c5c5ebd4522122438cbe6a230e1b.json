    "description": "When in Namibia, I followed two lion brothers for 3 days. They had just taken down a giraffe and were surrounding their fallen prey. As I started to notice their personalities, one of them seemed aggressive and protective every time I tried stepping out of the car to get this very low perspective for a portrait. He made it clear it was his territory and he wasn't going to have me. His brother, on the other hand, was much more curious. On the third day, he was left alone as his protective brother went for water. I stepped out of the car and crawled under it and this is what happened. He was curious, he wanted to see what was I. He saw me and I saw him. For a moment, I felt connected to this lion ever since. This is a personal favorite of mine and a treasure of a portrait.",
