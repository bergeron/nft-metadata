    "description": "The <Brain Planet> series began as an attempt to draw anything you could think of. The artist went beyond rational logic and drew things that came to mind at random as if they were recorded as drawings. As a result, as the process of repeatedly scanning and scrambling thoughts in the brain was repeated, it also had a performance element that seemed to empty itself, and became a narrative drawing with a strong self-monologue tendency.\n\n#NFTart  #paper-drawing  #brain  #physical-based",
