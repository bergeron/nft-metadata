    "description": "Î© Welcome hOhm. My name is Godfrey Meyer, and I paint sound waves. I like to imagine my hand is a seismograph or an EKG machine, and my paintings are expressions of waves in my mind, applied to digital mediums. I have been traveling lately and moving around like a sound wave. It has been difficult to find a place to call \"hOme\" ...  But I find \"hOme\" is in our heads. Hope you can enjoy the works! Much love! There are 10 works in this series. ",
