    "description": "\nFACE YOUR DEMONs \n\nmini collection is all about accepting your shadow self. Inspired by ancient Bulgarian traditions of Kukeri where in the last days of winter male dancers dress in sheepskin garments, wear masks, and sing songs to scare away the evil spirits and invite a rich harvest for the upcoming year.\n-\nThat’s an old tradition which I’ve decided to modernize by using my signature character and illustrating the vices of the new world, which prevent us from living in our true passion and nature. \n-\nThrough awareness and understanding, you become acquainted with your Shadow, your unconscious actions, so as not to become a victim to the programmed patterns which accompany them.\n-\nBy inviting your demons to tea, you establish ownership of your shadow which in return sets your soul free and lets you truly shine and explore your higher self and purpose in this realm.",
