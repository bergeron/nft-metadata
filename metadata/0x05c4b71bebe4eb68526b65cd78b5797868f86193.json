    "description": "Part of the \"WABI-SABI: Acceptance of transience. The Beauty of things that are Imperfect, Impermanent, Incomplete.\" photo series.\n\nThis is my genesis NFT artwork minted using my own contract on Manifold Studio.\n\nI spent nearly 3 months around Japan trying to understand a very profound and rooted Japanese concept that goes back many centuries… that of Wabi-sabi. Wabi-sabi is the quintessential Japanese aesthetic. It is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is a beauty of things modest and humble. It is a beauty of things unconventional… of everyday things… man-made, natural and the union of the two. With the following images (still an ongoing project) I am trying to render this deeply rooted concept of the Japanese philosophy and way of life.\n\nA 1of1 edition (also available as museum quality Fine Art Giglèe Print).\n\nOn my website, www.tonycorocher.com, you can find more info, international awards, exhibitions and more about my photography and NFT artworks.\n\nPlease follow me on Instagram & Twitter (tonycorocher).",
