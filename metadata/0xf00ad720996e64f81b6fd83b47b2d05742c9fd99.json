    "description": "This collection consists of 42 meteorites that have had significant impact events or are known for their potential danger.\n\nThe fear of a meteorite crashing into Earth arises from the potential for widespread destruction and catastrophic consequences. Throughout history, impact events have caused significant damage and even mass extinctions. While meteorite impacts are rare, they can lead to explosions, fires, tsunamis, and long-term climate effects. Scientists actively monitor Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) and develop strategies to detect and mitigate potential threats. If a hazardous meteorite is identified, various techniques can be used to alter its course. Despite the fear, scientific efforts help mitigate the risks associated with meteorite impacts.",
