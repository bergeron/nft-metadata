    "description": "EQULIBRIUM #01 is the first piece of a serie where the conceptual driving force is the climate change and the human impact on these fragile ecosystems.\n\nIncreased ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry are the greatest global threats to coral reef ecosystems. These threats are caused by warmer atmospheric temperatures and increasing levels of carbon dioxide in seawater.\n\nCoral reefs are one of the most diverse and delicate ecosystems on the planet earth and it's so agonizing to witness that one single specie, humans are responsible for this unprecedented climate disaster.\n\nIn a graphic and abstract way, I wanted to represent and remind the beauty of this equlibrium.",
