    "description": "Al Capone Handwritten Letter\n\nThe Mob Experience is proud to present the Al Capone letter. This is the only known example of a letter penned by Al Capone.\n\nThis letter was written by Al Capone while he was an inmate at Alcatraz Island. The letter is addressed to his son, Sonny. In the letter, Al Capone describes his daily life at Alcatraz as an inmate. He discusses his involvement in a band called the Rock Islanders in which he played the mandola.\n\nAccording to history, the Rock Islanders was disbanded shortly after he wrote this letter to his son. The main reason was due to his propensity for violence. Al Capone took his mandola and beat another inmate with it, resulting in the end of the Rock Islanders as a band. The letter also details Capone's daily activity and provides advice to his son.\n\nThe letter was acquired from the roommate of Sonny Capone, Al Caponeâ€™s son. He had the letter in his possession and sold it to the Mob Experience.\n\nThis NFT consists of 1 collage and 5 images, which can be viewed at https://mobexperiencenft.com/asset/CAP_0001 . Unmarked high-resolution versions are available for viewing and downloading by the holder of the NFT.\n\nNFT ownership does not grant any rights to either the digital or physical assets.",
