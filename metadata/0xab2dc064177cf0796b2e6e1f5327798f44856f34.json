    "name": "Mother. Unfinished Portrait",
    "description": "Original made 2021, canvas \\ acrylic, 180 * 160 cm. \n\n2020 year, like for many, was difficult for me. There were indeed many significant losses, chief among which was the death of my mother.\nSince childhood, I have observed a number of states that I conventionally perceived as her separate personalities observed by me in different periods.\nI still cannot say with certainty what this person was 100%. Caring and affectionate mother? A hypochondriac frightening with his pain and resentment? A narcissist who plays hide and seek with his sexuality? A philosopher looking for answers? All this and more, but none of them completely. As a result, leaving behind scattered impressions and a flash of awareness, mom left, as each of us leaves.\nThe title contains the word - unfinished. This concerns my perception of the possibility of describing something in principle. There is nothing definitive when it comes to our perception. We are always missing something else..",
