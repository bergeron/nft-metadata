    "description": "In a post-apocalyptic world, humanity had been divided into tribes, struggling to survive. The most powerful of these tribes had fused themselves with machines to increase their strength and abilities. They had robotic parts, implanted sensors, and their brains were linked to computers. They saw themselves as superior to the other tribes and had no qualms about raiding them for resources and capturing members to use as spare parts.\nThe other tribes, the weak ones, were forced to defend themselves and scavenge for resources to maintain their own body-machine hybrids. There was a constant fear of being captured. The world had become a dystopia where those with the most advanced technology held power over all, and those without it could only survive at the mercy of those who controlled it.\n\n\n",
