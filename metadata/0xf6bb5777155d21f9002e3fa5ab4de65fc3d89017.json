    "description": "< crypto trading dark elf: 2 >\n\n[Singapore Standard] January 22, PM 06:48 \n\nEven in the middle of winter, but Singapore is very warm\n\nIn Korea, it is the weather where you have to worry that the water meter will explode now, but here it is not cold at all even if soaking in the pool\n\nAs you may know, on December 1st, dark elf 「cott』 sold all the crypto she had\n\nAnd...\n\nlike a lie massive bear market began\n\nSince the bear market, cott has not traded crypto once\n\nCott was watching the fireworks at the hotel's swimming pool leisurely and floating the price of crypto on her laptop\n\n“Cott, why are you watching the price of crypto when you’re not even going to trade?”\n\nShe answered my question with the most beautiful smile in the world\n\n\"It's like watching fireworks. It's so beautiful to see capital disintegrating in the air, and it makes me happy\"\n\nMaybe... Isn't the temperature difference between dark elves and humans wider than that between Korea and Singapore?\n",
