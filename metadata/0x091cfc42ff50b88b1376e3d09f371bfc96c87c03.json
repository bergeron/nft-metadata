    "description": "Raijin (雷神, \"Thunder God\") is a mythical character that is widely popular as a tattoo subject.\nI thought long and hard about what would be a meaningful first collection to publish and this just came to me when I started drawing. This collection is a true reflection of my journey , starting as a graphic designer then subsequently a freelance illustrator to finally finding my passion as a tattoo artist. \nI wanted the main subject to be a pig (reminiscing my earlier days as a tattoo artist working on pig’s skin for practice. I find this collection strangely quirky yet oddly comforting for me. ",
