    "description": "hi sound iâ€™m wilter. i try to make soothingly unstable songs that live in the in-betweens. in between genres, thoughts, dreams, places, conversations, the organic and artificial. this song, â€˜not looking out the window anymoreâ€™, has always felt like the best example of what i do and iâ€™m proud to make it my genesis drop here on sound\n\ni had just broken up with my girlfriend and we decided to take a trip to the mountains to get closure on a positive note.  this song is about that trip and the journey back down the foggy mountain road back to the reality of the city.  it was a time of transition in my life where i felt like many things were leaving me while i was paralyzed in place.. broken glass around my feet. \n\nthis was one of those rare songs that just bled out of me in one sitting. every part from the lyrics, to the melody, to the instrumental and production still feels so true and flows in such a natural way. itâ€™s my favorite song iâ€™ve ever written ðŸ¦ŒðŸ¦ŒðŸ¦Œ",
