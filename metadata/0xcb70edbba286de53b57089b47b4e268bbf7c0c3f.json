    "description": "\nNumbers are part of our life.\nSome of them define the moment of our birth, our age, others are hidden in everyday life and ultimately, they are abstract concepts describing the physics phenomena surrounding us.\n\nWhy not giving them a form that allows us to observe them, to admire them, to interpret them? If we ask the numbers to create a visual experience, they will surprise us.\n\nCreative Numbers were born from the curiosity of representing numbers in an unconventional and above all unique way. The first piece of the collection, Ï€ Gem ðŸ”¹ðŸ”·, comes from an algorithm that manipulates the first 4000 digits of Pi. Each pair of decimals gives the coordinates to a point with random shape, size and color. The process is iterated and the result is art. Unique, because the random elements cannot be reproduced again. And special, because this combination of shapes and colours plunges roots in a number that knows no boundaries. It is a small gem that holds the infinity.\n\nDimensions: 6400x6230 px",
