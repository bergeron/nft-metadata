    "description": "Minimum wage is about the day that I understood that he bare minimum of absolutely anything is simply not going to cut it anymore (wage, love, time, loyalty, energy, you name it). This record was born in my writing sanctuary, the castle in Bordeaux, France, in a writing camp with 3 incredible producers. It is an anthem of all of our early twenties, a time stamp of my many day jobs - selling printer ink to the US army, assistant to an interior designer, party planning, waiting tables, singing at steak houses to empty rooms, you name it. This song is an ode of gratitude and respect to those choices in the pursuit of the dream - running to sessions and rehearsals after an 8-hour minimum wage paying work day. It is also a farewell to hustling for anything that is not the gift of music. This song is part of the \"Queen George\" chapter of my music that will include my recent releases. ",
