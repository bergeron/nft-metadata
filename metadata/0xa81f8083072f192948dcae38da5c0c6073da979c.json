    "description": "Geodetic Memory interprets our desire to dance with the unconscious mind, to bring forth an idea... and shape the Web3.0 experiment in the name of art. \n\nScenarios that might be considered bizarre or impossible 'in real life' are made possible every day in Web3.0.\n\nGeodetic Memory draws inspiration from the surrealist work of Salvador Dali, celebrating the magic and strange beauty of our human existence.\n\n- The summit was recorded by MintFace on 3rd July 2022. \n- The 'moon face' and 'mirror portal' were AI generated by Dall-E, and then introduced into the scene by MintFace for eventual minting and insertion into our collective memory.  \n",
