    "description": "For centuries, sculptured rice terraces have dominated vast expanses of land across South-East Asia.  \n\nSituated at the heart of the Indonesian archipelago, lies the mystical island of Bali where manicured landscapes of verdant hues, lapped by swaying palms, are synonymous with its reputation as a tropical paradise.   \n\nNot only does the existence of the terraces play a huge part in the agriculture of the island, they are a physical manifestation of the ancient Balinese Hindu philosophy “Tri Hita Karana” that explores the harmony between God, Nature and its People.\n\n‘Elysium’ is a Genesis Edition piece by Tom Morris \n\nArtwork Title:  Elysium  \nArtist:  Tom Morris (Colourwrks)  \nEdition:  50 | 50  \nPrice:  0.030Ξ  \nCapture Date:  28 October 2021  \nCapture Location:  Ubud, Bali, Indonesia\n\nLicense : Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
