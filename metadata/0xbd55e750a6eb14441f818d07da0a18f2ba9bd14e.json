    "description": "If you analyze social networks in the real world you will discover two things: Social connections are always clustered and its much more likely that you know somebody which has a smaller social distance to you than somebody from the other side of the planet. This piece visualizes exactly that. It consists of 8171 nodes distributed in randomly clustered clusters and  40894 connections where its unlikely, but not impossible, to connect two nodes which are far away. In the end you get a beautiful network that is surprisingly dense and fulfills all properties you would expect from a real social network.",
