    "description": "When you shoot for the moon, you may not always hit it. Just keep at it, cause you know you're in it to win it.\n- This NFT comes with an IRL grab bag with a Flipacadabra fingerboard and a blue moonstone, so you can practice your backside flip board grabs out wherever you play with this AR-T in the real world. \n- The winning bidder of this NFT gets a USDZ file format of the piece, so AR is possible on IOS as well as android devices. And as always, feel free to put this in your Metaverse galleries. ðŸ›¹",
