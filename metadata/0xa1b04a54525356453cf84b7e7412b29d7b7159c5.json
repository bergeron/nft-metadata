    "description": "Hen na Kao (Japanese for \"weird face\") consists of weekly created 1/1 premium PFP artworks by GoodboiEnma. The artworks are drawn digitally and are all symmetrical, depicting the weirdness when looking at a perfect symmetrical face. Heavily influenced by his japanese roots, Enma creates a mixture of dark and demonic subjects with the flat japanese shading used in antique and modern illustrations.",
