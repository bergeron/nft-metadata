    "description": "A girl obsessed with Ether. The ether symbol was inspired by the first cryptocurrency I know for transactions with NFT.\n\nOriginally uploaded on OS, but finally \"burned\" after I got my FND invite (Big thank you to a great onee-san for the invite). Then, she was moved into FND, because drawing her took quite time, so FND was more suitable for her.",
