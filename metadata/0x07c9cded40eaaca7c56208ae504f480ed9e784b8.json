    "description": "The Minister of Gaming\n\nIn the outside world There are ministers of sport. In the metaverse that would be ridiculous. There is however a certain need to organize and unite the Gaming world. And this is where this character comes in.\nShe grew up on the busy streets of Los Santos and grew her reputation in every race, arcades, casino heist, etc. This is the role of his life. Her talent and gift is at its peak and everyone knows that if they play against her there is only one possible outcome...she wins and puts you to shame.\n\nIllustration ( Corel and Photoshop) \n2160x3840pix\n",
