    "name": "Globe of Hermes: Auriga of Andromeda",
    "description": "Amongst the Greek Gods, lies an acropolis which marvels upon the universe they created. \n\nHermes, the messenger of the gods, looks down from the heavens which lies within the 11th dimension. He gazes upon his canvas of Auriga, a middle planet in the Andromeda galaxy envious of the feeling at lower vibrations. Life is simple. \n\n“If thou but settest foot on this path, thou shalt see it everywhere.” - Hermes",
