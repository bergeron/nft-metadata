    "description": "Computer in a Red Chair references Fairfield Porter's portrait of his daughter, Elizabeth. In the original work, Elizabeth stares out at the viewer, challenging them with her gaze. In this work, Elizabeth has been replaced with a screen, and the screen depicts a variation of the work The Spiral, by crypto artist Pho. Like Elizabeth, the image of the spiral challenges the viewer, perhaps suggesting an endless descent into the digital world. At the same time, the work itself acts out this descent, through its multiple references, which sit inside each other like concentric circles.",
