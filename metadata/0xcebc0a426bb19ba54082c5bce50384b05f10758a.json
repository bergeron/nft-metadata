    "name": "Upper Spa Pool - Karijini",
    "description": "The upper spa pool is a now iconic location in the Hamersley Gorge section of Karijini National Park.\n\nThis was one of my first viral photos, I photographed this in 2011, long before any images of Karijini were going viral and this particular composition was unique to me at the time.\n\nSince then this composition has been endlessly copied, people have won major awards with images that are close to an exact copy of this one.\n\nAt one point this image had racked up over 3 billion views on Google Maps, it has become the face of Karijini National Park in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.\n\nI'm minting the original piece, the collector of this piece will get a signed fine art print of it as well as a signed copy of my Western Australia portfolio book.",
