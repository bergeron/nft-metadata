    "name": "The first weaver",
    "description": "The first weaver was also the weaver of the human world. She wove the strongest cloth and twisted the longest yarn, both were used when she ran away from the upper world and descended to the then empty and dark middle world. Finally she could lead a life of her own, free from the forced marriage and parental control. \n\nOf course everything was not as easy as it seems. \n\nFirst, she had to face the dragon lord of the underworld. Into his head she stuck a sword, not to kill him, as the dragon is an immortal creature, but to tame him and put him into sleep. The dragon is a symbol of primal desire, and to be a master of the dragon she becomes the master of herself. \n\nThe new found freedom made her wiser and wide awake, because now whatever she does would affect the balance of the three world. Apparently our first weaver just discovered that she is a goddess and that she just initiated a new human world in the middle of the equilibrium.",
