    "description": "\"Not giving much thought\nA feeling of being whisked away will cause great regret in the coming days.\"\n\nThe passage from innocence to rebellion is depicted in this work, which captures youth and adolescence and the transition from innocence to rebellion. From rebellion to adulthood.\n\nIt is common for us to find it difficult to advocate for ourselves. \nWe can quit easy or not even attempt. \nWhen we make a mistake, lose, or fail,  \nWe struggle to deal. \nDue to this, we rebel against our own self-interests by giving up our childhood interests, activities, and relationships.\n\nChess is like a greatly simplified representation of life. \nA lot of ideas racing through our head, and we want to be able to take them all in and consider how one opening would work in a little different circumstance.\n\nHowever, while we're still kids. \nThe fast escalating complexity of social and mental life that develops during adolescence and maturity is beyond our capacity to manage.",
