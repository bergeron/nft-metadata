    "description": "This artwork is my effort to tell a timeless story of the infinite love and bond between mother and child. The use of chrysanthemums is a nod to my heritage symbolic of longevity and devotion in Chinese culture. I incorporated 4 different variations of the flower as it passes through the seasons as a reminder of how short of time we have with our loved onesâ€™ earth side, but the ever-evolving nature and relationship we have is so special. This artwork was the first digital piece I ever created when learning about web3 and digital art, I was hugely inspired by the memories of my grandma and a tribute to the enduring impact of maternal love and the bond that connects generations.
