Some wounds are created by someone who binds us and it will stay with us forever. \n\nMy face is wounded. There survived the blood flowing from my eyes and mouth. My tears have dried up. Even the bandage on my neck still full of blood And of course it's like a collar.\n\n4000 x 4500 px.\n16.34 MB\n\nHand-Draw Art by \nCZY_Justczy",
