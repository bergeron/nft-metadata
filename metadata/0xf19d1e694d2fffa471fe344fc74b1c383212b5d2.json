    "description": "He was born in black eye!\nThe Black Eye Galaxy, also known as Evil Eye Galaxy and designated Messier 64, M64, or NGC 4826 in the New General Catalogue, is a spiral galaxy in the constellation of Coma Berenices. It is a relatively isolated galaxy around 24 million light years away from us and has a diameter of 70,000 light years. \nThe galaxy is also known for being composed of two counter-rotating disks, roughly equal in mass. The inner disk contains the galaxy’s spectacular dust clouds and lanes. All the stars in the Black Eye Galaxy rotate in the same direction as the gas in M64’s core region, clockwise, while the gas in the outer regions rotates in the other direction.",
