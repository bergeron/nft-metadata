    "description": "I want to transform how people experience life. It strikes a balance between a life viewed rationally and one that stresses the influence of the unconscious and dreams. I am drawn to the unexpected, the unsettling, the outlandish, and the odd for their enchantment and weird beauty. Their quest for independence and readiness to question imposed ideals and norms are at the heart of their work.\n\n\nDigital illustration\n\nPNG\n4800 x 3600px",
