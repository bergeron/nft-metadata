    "description": "Summer of 2013, I went to the beach with two friends to watch the meteor showers in Crete, Greece.\n\nAfter some time, one of the guys pointed at the sky with a startled voice saying “what is that?” At first, I couldn’t see what he's pointing at, but then I noticed something moving. The object was darker than the sky, hiding the stars like a shadow. As it was silently passing above us, I could tell that it was triangular. It just kept going in the same direction until we couldn’t see it anymore.\n\nThis summer, I went back to Crete and met the friend that noticed it first. We were telling the story to his cousin and I realized he had seen more of it. At first, the object had three lights, and was moving as if “scanning the land.” When he points our attention to it, the lights go off, and it heads in our direction.\n\nI don’t know if the timing was a coincidence.\n\nAll I know is that we saw something that couldn’t be rationalized, and believe me, we tried.\n\nGeorgi Georgiev | 2400x3000",
