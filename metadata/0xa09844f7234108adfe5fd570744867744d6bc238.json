    "description": "\n\"Cars hidden in places\" is an exploration of the intersection between technology and imagination. \nUsing AI-generated images of cars that don't exist, I have hidden these vehicles in various locations around the world. By doing so, I am inviting the audience to engage with their surroundings in a new and imaginative way, by seeking out something that is both familiar and otherworldly.\nI hope to inspire curiosity and wonder to the audience.",
