    "description": "This is a photograph I captured on 35mm film in Washington state. I watched from the beach as this couple stood silhouetted in the distance. There's something visceral about they way you feel after a relationship ends, a sense of clarity that you can only experience after you've been left alone to ruminate the loss. Your own flaws and mistakes seem so obvious, and all the things you love about that person bubble to the surface like air trapped deep underwater. In this moment I was uncomfortable, witnessing someone else's intimacy when I felt so alone. But I couldnâ€™t look away, and as he leaned in to kiss her I captured a single image. To me, this photo represents both what it feels like to be in love, and how it feels when a love story ends. Capturing this image inspired me to embrace these feelings, and serves as a reminder to appreciate every moment you share with someone, no matter how small.  ",
