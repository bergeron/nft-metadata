    "description": "I love heartbreak, to be honest. I often find inspiration in memories or images stuck in my head; very visual, and very vivid.\n\nWhen I reached out to Sara, I remember telling her about this idea of being in a new relationship while still dreaming about the previous one. It’s a tough spot you know? It hurts. I guess we all have that past relationship that hasn’t really allowed us to move on, that messed us up. As a result, we end up unconsciously looking for that person in everyone we meet, which most likely won’t happen and will end up hurting the other person.\n\nSo this song is about that, how cold and lonely it feels to be with the wrong person. How painful it feels to hold on to one and not have the courage to let go. How we lie and say we are fine, hurts like hell.\n\nSpecial thanks to Sara for making this vision a reality and putting it into words, it means the world to me. Also, shoutout to Jack Hentosh for mixing and mastering, and Nicolas Melo for the amazing artwork.\n\nWith love,\n\n\nCharlie Crown",
