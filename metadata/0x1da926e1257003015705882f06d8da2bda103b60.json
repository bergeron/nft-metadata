    "description": "This 1/1 painting and accompanying animation by OzeArv represents the artists view of 80-90's Hollywood and the dominance of their audio/visual culture over our society. The 3 pink characters and flamingos are representative of the kitsch themes of those times and the disco vibes that emerged. The fat man in the centre of the painting is a depiction of us and the society that has grown consuming all of its bullshit, leading to a world raining with pills.",
