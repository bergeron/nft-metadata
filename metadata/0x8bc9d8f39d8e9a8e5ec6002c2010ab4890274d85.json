    "description": "CONTINUUM is a digital animation created in 2022 using digital moiré patterning - a central technique in my practice - in which two overlapping images generate the illusion of a third. In CONTINUUM, the interrelated concepts of space and time are interpreted using this technique; they are manifested visually through minimal geometric forms, an hourglass (time) and a sphere (space). CONTINUUM also considers digital animated loops as continuums, where time and space exist autonomously and indefinitely in their own dimension. CONTINUUM is part of a larger body of research inspired by optical and kinetic visual forms originating from the 1960s and 1970s, such as the work of Victor Vasarely, as well as by science fiction book covers from the series “Ailleurs et Demain” (Elsewhere and Tomorrow) published by Robert Laffont in France in 1969. \n\nArtwork information: mp4, 3840x2160pixels (4K), 72 frames, 256 colors, 25fps, 2022.  \n\nClaim your edition at www.app.manifold.xyz/c/continuum",
