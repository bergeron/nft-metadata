    "description": "A conceptual self-portrait curated to create a feeling of sleepiness. This is achieved by adding the expressions of a yawn. As an artist, I get really motivated while showcasing natural day-to-day human emotions in my portraits. The small details of human nature matter to me a lot and I always try to inculcate this in my photography. Hope you didnâ€™t yawn back !\n\nEditions : 30\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by the holder of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
