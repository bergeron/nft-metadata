I want to be with the one I love but still I sit here, in the midst of all the terrible smog of ignorance people breath over me. Lies, using me, sending mixed signals, and mistreating my kindness for their very own pleasure. All of the anger anguished, as I have finally found the one I truly love, but the teaming pool of negative trauma left in me from all the people in the past, still clouds over me like a toxic fume of disgusting mess that even a sewer wouldn't want to expect, slowly dissolving me away into an abyss of nothing. Tears bloody at this point...\n\nThe first collector will receive the original artwork, signed and dated by me.\n\n5095 x 7014 - 600 PPI - File Size: 35,368,381 bytes",
