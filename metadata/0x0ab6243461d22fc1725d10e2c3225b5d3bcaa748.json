    "description": "\"STATE OF THE ART\" is a conceptual work appropriating XCOPY's \"Right-click and Save As guy\"\n\nThe image is the original file minted by XCOPY, unchanged. The newly minted token identifies it a new artwork by virtue of the Ethereum blockchain being uniquely addressed\n\nXCOPY's \"Right-click and Save As guy\" is in public domain. The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply\n\nThe title \"STATE OF THE ART\" is an idiom defined as \"the most recent stage in the development of a product, incorporating the newest technology, ideas, and features\"\n\nThe title also suggests the work is (legally & artistically) transformative while commenting on the precarious feeling that web3 will create a revolution for traditional copyright, originality & ownership. This is the current \"state of art\"\n\n\"STATE OF THE ART\" is not in public domain, what exactly does that imply?\n\nMS_JIF\n2022",
