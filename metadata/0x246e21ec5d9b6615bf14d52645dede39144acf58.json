    "description": "“Im sick of getting through I need to get on!”\n\nTo me, this song was something I wrote about survival. I have survived all these years, we make it though all these battles with only the thought of making it to the light at the end of the tunnel. But, as life always shows us there are more obstacles at every turn. This is a song about acknowledging that I have struggled, I have fought through countless failures and setbacks, obstacles and battles, but now I feel I have learned enough. I feel I have paid a lot of my dues and now I am ready for the fruits of my labor to come, so I can elevate myself to the next chapter of my life. I wrote this song for my family, and everybody else in this world who needs to get through and Get On!",
