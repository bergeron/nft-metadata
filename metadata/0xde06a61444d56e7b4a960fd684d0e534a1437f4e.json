    "description": "The sanctuary is a traditional painting made with gouache and colored pencils.\nThe warm colors are meant to bring comfort to the space while showing the vibrant aura of the Persian culture and the nostalgia carried in it.\nThe most detailed parts of this painting are shapes and colors used within the Persian rug.\nIt is meant to represent a traditional and handmade rug that is a core part of the culture.\nThe nude muse in the center is a way of celebrating femininity and what is deemed shameful due to the wrong ideologies that are stuck to the culture and itâ€™s made to celebrate those who break out of the fear that is carried through generations",
