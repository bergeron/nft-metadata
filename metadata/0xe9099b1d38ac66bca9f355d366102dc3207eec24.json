    "description": "The Great Hornbill is found in the Southeast Asia. Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.  Hornbills are Monogamous that is they live with their single partner till their death.  Hornbills nest in the cavities of tall trees. Female checks the cavities based on food availability and safety. Once the female pick the nest, they undergo an interesting breeding habit.Female hornbill locks herself within the cavity by covering the opening with mud, barks, excreta, saliva, etc. She leaves a small opening to share the food. Male hornbills collect food for female and young ones . They cannot swallow food caught at the tip of the beak as their tongues are too short to manipulate it, so they toss it back to the throat with a jerk of the head. \n\nEdition 1/1\nPhoto by Nigin\nLocation - Kerala, India\n\n                                    ",
