    "description": "Known for its fertile soil or “Chernozems”, Ukraine is home to the most productive soils in the world. The blue-yellow flag of Ukraine is reminiscent of the vast golden-yellow gran fields under a blue sky. This artwork depicts a war torn sky caused by Russian bombardments. Dust clouds darkening the sky tie in similarities with the Dust Bowl in the 1930s that displaced thousands of Americans in a tragic soil erosion disaster. While the similar “breadbasket” of the United States was primarily a natural disaster the implications of an attack on Ukraine will ripple across societies worldwide.\n\n70% of all proceeds from this artwork will be donated to Unicefs iniative: Protect the Children of Ukraine",
