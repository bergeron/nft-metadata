    "name": "GARDEN OF PERSEPHONE",
    "description": "The divine garden is located at the foot of the palace of Hades, a small paradise where the soul of his wife Persephone lives. Imprisoned in the realm of the dead, she created a reminder of her home, where the goddess of fertility led a serene and happy life.\nSurprising huge fruit fruits grow among the dense thicket, which are taken care of by long-haired and beautiful nymphs.\nEveryone who enters the kingdom of Hades can walk through the flowering garden of Persephone for the last time and feel forgiveness, kindness and love before being lost forever in the cold emptiness of the kingdom of the dead.",
