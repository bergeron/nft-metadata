    "description": "BORN is photomanipulation conceptual work.\nthe process was from 3D assets to every finest details edit and final touch in Photoshop.\n.\nBORN is lil' emotional and creative piece of art. Idea was something to let know what is coming... Scifi and ai is far amazing then we can imagine, i just tried lil' of them. From my manipulation whole collection BORN is my best ideation work i believe :)\nRhino Mom just delivered her lil' champ.. Don't forgot to check those tiny details. The status of process and that womb made up of glass tube and wires. \nand surrounding atmosphere of sunset and lil' cold.\nMOM is alright and Healthy :)\n.\nLoved this final result most ::",
