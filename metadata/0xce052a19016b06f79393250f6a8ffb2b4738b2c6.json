The clock could turn back time up to a month. \n\nbut I couldn't enjoy this ability. Because I'm destined to die. No matter what I do, I couldn't escape the fate of death. \n\nNumerous memories made with family and friends also disappeared after rewind a clock.\n\nToday, Finally I decide to accept my fate. I threw the watch into the sea. Last trip is just begun.\n\nLast trip(2022)\n1700*2600 png.",
