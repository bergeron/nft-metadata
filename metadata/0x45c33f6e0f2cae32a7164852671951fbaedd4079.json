    "description": "This is my genesis NFT. I made this today, Thursday May fifth two thousand twenty-two, in honor of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. It's not perfect but in just a handful of hours I put my soul into this piece in a way I haven't managed to do with any other art I have made. I understand if she is not as appealing as most of the more aesthetic art is in this space but I chose to make her feel more personal. I hope she can yield a sense of identity strong enough to be used as a profile picture or at the very least be the coolest conversation piece in someone's wallet. I want whoever owns this NFT to feel a sense of pride every time they see her.\n\nThe red handprint over her mouth symbolizes the indigenous women who were silenced.\n\nForty-five  percent of the proceeds from this sale will go to nativehope.org. Thirty percent will go to LandBackDAO. For more information feel free to contact me via Twitter.",
