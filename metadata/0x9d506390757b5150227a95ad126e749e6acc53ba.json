    "description": "Hi there, I am Markus Gley, born in 1980 in Greifswald Germany, graduate master student of the Held class at the UDK (University of the Arts) Berlin. Art as I do is very extrovert and I developed quickly my own memorable style. For my NFTs I use my original painted canvas as a template. Truly unique works blending traditional means with advanced tech. More information on www.markusgley.de.\n\nOriginal created on canvas\nEdition: 1 of 1\nPhysical and digital painting",
