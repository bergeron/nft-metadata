    "description": "Questioning how would Monet work with new art forms.\n\nHow would Monet experience dance and video forms?\n\nIn this art form, I am exercising on these questions with using my own dance footage with colors & feelings of Monet. \n\nChanging the perspective a bit & leaving the real nature sounds on the piece to create a living, animated oil print that will merge classic & new age world together. \n\nI wanted to share a feeling of the peace brought by an old piece mixing with my slow but intentional movements that enjoys nature.",
