    "description": "\"Explosion of Colors\" is Johan Lolos' genesis piece and is part of his genesis NFT series \"Hálendið\" which means \"Highlands\" in Icelandic. \n\n\"Hálendið\" is a photography series of 5 pieces that are a tribute to the painting-like landscapes of the Icelandic Highlands.\n\nEver since Johan first visited this part of the world he has been amazed by the huge diversity of colors that can be found in the Highlands. The unparalleled contrasts and shapes of the Hálendið make this region of Iceland so unique in the whole world, to the point it becomes almost surreal to any visitor.\n\nThis particular piece is an aerial image of Landmannalaugar, shot from a Cessna aircraft. The unique colors found in that place are completely natural, a result of local geothermal activity. The very first time Johan went to Landmannalaugar, he just couldn't believe his eyes. Was it real? Was it a dream? Why did those mountains look like paintings? His obsession with the Icelandic Highlands never stopped, to the point that they became his favorite landscapes to photograph. \n\n\"Explosion of Colors\" is Johan Lolos' second most popular image of all time. It was first featured in his debut book Peaks of Europe (2018), and has been sold to multiple clients and magazines ever since. \n\n** The collector will receive a gallery quality, signed and framed physical print of the image alongside the NFT. The print will be delivered with a certificate of authenticity. \n\n5000x3712px",
