    "description": "Elk are the most abundant large mammal found in Yellowstone and are an important species within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Yellowstone provides summer range for an estimated 10,000–20,000 elk (Cervus canadensis) from six to seven herds, most of which winter at lower elevations outside the park.\n\nNow that the elk population has returned to a more sustainable number their influence is more positive. Making up more than 90 percent of the wolves’ winter diet. Many species of scavengers survive off these kills.\n\nElk are the same species as the “red deer” in Europe. Some Europeans use the term “elk” for moose. To avoid confusion, elk in North America are often referred to by the Shawnee name wapiti.",
