    "description": "A series of drawings \"Children's Dreams\". \n\nWhen I was a child, different characters visited my dreams, and their images changed depending on the feelings I was experiencing. The day I felt resentment, that monster always came to me in my dreams. \n\nHe looked a little scary, but he never showed aggression to me. Even the opposite of him was a sense of support. This kind monster came to me in my dreams until I was eight years old.\n\nThe author of the picture is one of the main artists of the FORMOENART Community.\n\nCanvas / Oil / Stipple  (Size of original paintings: 40x30x cm)",
