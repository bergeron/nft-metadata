    "description": "Superposition is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. Within this system it is theoretically possible to be dead and alive at the same time. Everything is possible until the collapse of the wave function. The images in the collection visualize this superimposition of several states. Past, present and future: everything merges into potentially possible realities. The abstract and constructivist collages show emerging figures, scenes and objects of unknown origin. Various retro-esque glitch art moments melt everything into timeless surreal still lifes.\n\nAbstract generative art generated with various machine learning algorithms.\n\n2560 x 1408 (png)",
