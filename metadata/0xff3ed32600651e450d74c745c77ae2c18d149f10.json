    "description": "Time flies by. I’m a father of a daughter now, Playful, lively, open to everything and everyone. In her traits of character I see my mom’s. I think she is watching her from the above. \nIt’s important for me to re-live all of this just to know how much I love her. This was a tough time, but it brought us close to each other in a way we had never ever been before.",
