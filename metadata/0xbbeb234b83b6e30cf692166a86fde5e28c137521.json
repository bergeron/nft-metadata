    "description": "In an enchanted wood, a spider-baby, With a curious trait that made it shady, Crawled on wooden legs, searching for more, Until it found an apple to explore.\n\nTempted by the fruit, it reached out its arm, And in that moment, the spider knew harm, It crawled out of the frame and disappeared, Leaving behind a tale that's weird.\n\n\n",
