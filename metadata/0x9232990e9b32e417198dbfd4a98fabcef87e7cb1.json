    "description": "Read more on the [Trytebeats medium article](https://dadabots.medium.com/trytebeats-music-of-a-trinary-cpu-f95546295bd3) \n\nðŸŽ¶ \n\nWhat does a trinary computer sound like? Threes all the way down.\n\nTrytebeats is a program for a trinary (aka ternary) computer. It generates music using tritwise operators.\n\nYou're hearing powers of three on all scales of the waveform- the timbre, the melody, the harmony, the rhythm, the riffs, and the composition.\n\nðŸŽ¶ \n\nTrytebeat Î¸'s program is short and beautiful. I increment t, at a sample rate 3402 Hz, with 4-trit quantization:\n\n```(t*((tÎ¸(((t>>10)+2)%3%2)*2)>>6))&(t&(tÎ¸2)>>5)%81```\n\nThatâ€™s it. The code seems tiny, yet it blossoms into emergent sonic-visual complexity.\n\nðŸŽ¶ \n\nThis series is the birth of Trytebeats.\n\nCollector can claim an animated lenticular print of their Trytebeat shipped free. They look like [these](https://twitter.com/dadabots/status/1430136875524804624?s=20) ðŸ¥³ \n\nCollector also gets hifi video and future airdrop (see article)",
