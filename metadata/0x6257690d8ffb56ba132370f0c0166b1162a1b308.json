    "description": "My first trip to UAE, Dubai. \nMy truly first shooting in another country. \n\nUnsleeping night before early waking up.\n3:00am: This is the time when weâ€™ve started to prepare for this crazy desert shoot. \n\n5:00am: We went to the desert, or rather to an abandoned town in the middle of the desert called \"Ghost Village\". This is a very authentic and atmospheric place. All houses are devastated and filled with sand after a sandstorm.\n\n9:00am: This is the time when the air temperature reached 50 degrees Celsius and our film crew literally roasted right on the sand.\nWe immediately went home to cool down and recover.\n\nBut certainly this trip has forever remained in our memory of amazing trips.\n\nThis feeling of euphoria and inspiration was beyond any inconvenience. And I would accept challenge like this again for getting the same feelings.",
