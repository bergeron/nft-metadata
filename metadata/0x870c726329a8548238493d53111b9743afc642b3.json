    "description": "Using digital as a tool, surrealism as a language and the concept of THE LOVERS (Ren√© Magritte. 1928) whatever its interpretation, FUTURE LOVERS brings in its everyday portraits a classic and at the same time futuristic scenario, the timeless essence of interpretation about our human relationships (or not) today with digital and pandemic impacts, rewriting the way we see each other, touch each other, kiss each other and how we redesign at all costs the surreal idea that is love.",
