    "description": "\"Summer Walk With Friends in Latchi - Summer Edition. 2021 - 1/1 NFT - 10039x6846pix\n\nThe Summer edition is part of my collection, Taking a walk with my weird friends in Latchi. A collection that depicts the same scene in five different color variations. \n\nWinter - Spring - Summer - Autumn & Night.\n\nEach variation is a one-off NFT.\n\nThe artwork is a combination of two different inspiring moments in my life.\n\nThe drawing of my weird friends was created many years ago and has been challenged over and over with different coloring and style experimentations without sufficiently matching with any.\n\nOnly recently, during another inspiring moment, I chose to place mountains in the backgrounds of my compositions, local ones from Cyprus, to balance the feeling of the specific expression captured in my original digital drawings.\n\nLatchi is a small coastal village located in the northwest of the island of Cyprus.",
