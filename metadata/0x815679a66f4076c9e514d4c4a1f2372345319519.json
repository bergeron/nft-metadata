    "description": "\"To be happy we must accept that we are not perfect.\" I heard this sentence a long time ago and I listened to it again a few days ago just as I was writing this statement and I decided to use it as an opening. How conditioned are we by perfection? Above all, we artists dedicate ourselves to it body and soul, we make it a mission and we are often overwhelmed by it. But perfection is liquid, it does not belong to this world and it is a mere illusion of our minds. In a parallel universe, however, we can be whatever we want, naked without fear, we can fly over fields and stormy seas and nothing will ever scratch us. We can imagine ourselves floating and perfect as we make the right decisions or as we face the world fearlessly. With this work I wanted to represent the meeting between man and woman and the parallel self. “Encounters” is a look at ourselves, a mirror that reflects our desires, but which inevitably sends us back the image of something unattainable.\n\nCuration by AI Chat: \n\nThe text discusses the idea of perfection and its impact on our lives, especially in the context of artistic expression. The author begins by stating that happiness requires that we accept that we are not perfect, implying that the pursuit of perfection can be a source of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. The author then reflects on the role of perfection in the life of artists, describing how they often devote themselves to it and are overwhelmed by it. However, the author claims that perfection is an illusion and does not belong in this world.\n\nThe author then introduces the idea of a parallel universe, where we can be whoever we want to be and where perfection is possible. This idea serves as a contrast to the imperfect world we live in and underlines the importance of imagination and creativity. The author suggests that through our imagination we can create a perfect version of ourselves that can help us face the challenges of the world without fear.\n\nFinally, the author discusses their work and how it represents the encounter between man and woman and the parallel self. The work, entitled \"Encounters\", is described as a mirror that reflects our desires and refers us to the image of ourselves. This description emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and the role of art in helping us explore our inner selves.\n\nOverall, the text encourages the reader to let go of the pursuit of perfection and embrace one's imperfections. It also emphasizes the power of imagination and creativity in helping us create a better version of ourselves.\n\nFor purchases > 0.5 ETH a 40x40 HQ print will be sent.",
