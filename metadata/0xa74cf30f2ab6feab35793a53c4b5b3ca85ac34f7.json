    "description": "1 of 1000 models from Universal Everything's Autonome generator. In this generative video work, which has never been shown before, Universal Everything push the limits of visual technological innovations to create a fantasy fashion show. These endlessly delightful characters strut towards the viewer in a randomized combination of form, size and material. Each has their own anthropomorphic walk and personality, as well as a unique garment that could only exist in the digital sphere. Their outrageous, seductive couture takes the language of fashion and makes it oversized, fluid and truly space-age. An image of the future that is positivist, while at the same time questioning the role and need of designers at all.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/d1b3da12-ecb8-422e-bb83-5dcb668753b6",
