    "description": "One of the best feelings in surfing in tucking into a perfect barrel. Just you and the wave, a feeling that you alone are experiencing a fleeting moment in time.\n\n-About the Wave Sliders Collection-\n\nSurfing has been a part of who I am for as long as I can remember.  From spending time in the water with my then girlfriend to paddling out now with our three kids, to making a career out of creating surf art, It is woven into so many milestones in my life.  Like many others I am drawn to the ocean. I am drawn to the lifestyle, the scenic inspiration and the idea of a wave being a blank canvas on which to draw your own lines.  I am proud to share this collection of 5 “Wave Sliders” in hopes that we may all find connection over a shared stoke.\n\nCommemorative print #1 of the limited edition goes to the auction winner.\n\n2000x2000px\n2022\nAloha from the sunny shores of O‘ahu",
