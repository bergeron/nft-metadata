    "description": "Let's be honest, not all family gatherings are looked forward too. Especially not by people who fall prey to the untrained speech of those around the table. When I hear the words 'Season's Greetings' I immediately turn in, not wanting to meet as many family members as everyone else. Some of us prefer to be alone during the holidays. It's better than feeling alone, around the table.  ",
