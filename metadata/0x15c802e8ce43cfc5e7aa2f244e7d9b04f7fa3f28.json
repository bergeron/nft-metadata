    "description": "Everyone experiences difficulties at some point in life. In order to face ourselves and solve these problems, we need to overcome the pressure and break our chains. In this short film, the character is trapped, watched and manipulated and is inside a glass space in an abstract environment that prevents us from seeing the whole event clearly. She will try to get out of there, but this is not the last problem. There will be more and worse.\n\n2560 x 1440\n\nFor more detail just check my twitter account.",
