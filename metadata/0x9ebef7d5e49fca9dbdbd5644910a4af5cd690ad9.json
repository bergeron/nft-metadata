    "description": "I was perched on an overpass at the Adams/Wabash station in Chicago. Waves of rain kept passing through while I waited for the right moment. A series of events take place that beg me to be ready. I notice a train leaves the station,  one approaches in the distance and a wall of rain shifts over the scene. In the brief moment I captured the trains were partners in a slippery symmetry. ",
