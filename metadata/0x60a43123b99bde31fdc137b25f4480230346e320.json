    "description": "00 We live in a digital age where Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" easily materializes in the temporary escape from reality we receive from technology. \n\nOver time, our minds will depend on the assistance of technology... and ultimately grow lazy.\n\nIn order for our free minds to survive, we must foster organic imagination. \n\nThis is my first NFT on foundation. This piece is a fan art submission for avril15.NFT \n\n",
