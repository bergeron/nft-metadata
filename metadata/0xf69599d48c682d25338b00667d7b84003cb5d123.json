    "description": "This painting is called “The visitor” and it is a bit of a collage of images and influences I had during the journey here. Crossing borders both physically and mentally and arriving at this place left some deep impressions. Even my first Pupusa is in there which says a lot of the impression this very special food has had on me. I decided from the very start to use colours and objects from my surroundings here in the residence and this is what I have done. I decided to add the spaceship on a whim, just to show that digital works can as easily enter the physical world as vice versa. It felt good to get this first painting, “The visitor” done. I was on my way\n\nAcrylic on canvas\n70 x 60 cm",
