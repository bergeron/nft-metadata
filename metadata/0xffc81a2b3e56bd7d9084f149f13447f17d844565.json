    "description": "This conceptual art piece references the incredible work of John Baldessari. In 1967, Baldessari was pushing against conformity to conventional aspects of art or photography. \n\nThis piece by Basil Tahan | ModernVintagePhotos layers controversial issues of the current Art world  onto Baldessari's work. \n\nIt references LGBTQ+ rights, memes, Instagram, Non-Fungible Tokens, digital medium on historic processes and fine art nude photography among others.\n\nBasil Tahan is a master print maker of the platinum print.  The sale of this NFT will entitle the collector to an archival, museum quality platinum print made by the artist. It is a 1/1 print, signed and stamped on the reverse by the artist's gallery.\n\n",
