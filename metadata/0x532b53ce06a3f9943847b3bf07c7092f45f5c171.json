    "description": "This is one of 30 handmade NFTs from the Sydney Ducks genesis collection by British artist John Walter. Each is comprised of 2 vector-drawn characters, brought to life in Adobe Animate (1 main: Algeria, 1 supporting: Gerry). They float on top of Deviation Drive, a VR space built in Gravity Sketch. The San Franciscan fog, full of words and glyphs drawn in AnimVR, blows in from the sea to form a middle layer of noise between the protagonists of our drama.",
