    "description": "First in the trilogy of the \"Memories Unlived\" series: Three unique digital memories. A tribute crafted with care and nostalgia to unlived memories of Japan.\n\nA memory questioned. A windy day in Nagano, and you are out on an afternoon stroll. Time to take in some much needed sun as you've been cloistered away indoors so much this summer. A feeling of déjà vu takes a hold as you approach a short bridge laid over a swiftly flowing canal. You shake free of the false feeling of familiarity and the memory of it is swept away downstream. Canvas size: 2000x1000",
