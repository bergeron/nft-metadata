    "description": "Achoo is a generative collection of 10,000 unique NFTs with 62 special edition 1/1s, minted on the Ethereum Blockchain using an innovative community-wide experience called \"viral minting\". The collection was designed by Tair Almor, a world-renowned ceramic artist and designer, inspired by her personal global pandemic experience of 2020-21. Each Achoo NFT is accompanied by Sneeze tokens, that can be used to continue spreading the project to new holders through the \"viral minting\" mechanism.
