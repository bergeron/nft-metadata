    "description": "Ana is a woman with a strong attitude who is willing to go to any lengths to prove that she too can have fun in an environment where harassment is the order of the day. In this piece, Ana is represented by a flamingo with a defiant attitude, encompassed with love and passion and in a context split in two halves. In the lower part we have her current life represented by chaos, and pointed shapes, on the other hand, in the upper part we have her dream life, represented with minimalism geometries, a Euro symbol, and her desire to realise everything she can see in the house where she works. In addition, several staircases are shown representing her path to the life she dreams of.\n\nCollaboration with \"Calladita\", a film by Miguel Faus.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/529e32d0-ef6e-4527-b8a3-4da65a3775a8",
