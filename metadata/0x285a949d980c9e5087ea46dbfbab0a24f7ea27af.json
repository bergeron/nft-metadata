    "description": "The Oregon Coast is home to some of the most dramatic and beautiful scenes imaginable. When I took a trip there with my friends in February of 2022, I could not be more excited to get out there and see what art I could capture. But in typical PNW fashion, the weather ended up being bad for the trip with unforeseen rain.\n\nBut this didn't discourage me because I knew there was still opportunities for me as an artist. Because in recent months before this trip I had begun to dive into the world of composite photography. Which can be a touchy subject for some but I see it as a way for me to take advantage of every photo trip I take. And that is exactly what I did.\n\nI ended up capturing this killer foreground with the leading lines and crashing waves. But the sky was flat gray. So, I ended up swapping the sky with one I had captured earlier in the year. This piece took a lot of work but came out better than I could've imagined that showcases my true artistic vision and ability.\n\n-Ryan Warner",
