    "description": "My journey with Liquid Art has been focused on the collision above water.  I decided to look at what lies beneath the collision. Underneath the crown the shapes that slowly transform in front of your eyes are so enjoyable to observe. This image was taken in a tank of water, so I was shooting through the glass. Seeing the liquid split off into little squid/mushroom figures was not dissimilar to what occurs above water.   \n\nA bit about me, I have been a hobby photographer most of my life. 5 years ago I decided to leave my corp role & go 100% into photography. I work with executives all around my NZ & OZ. Covid has throat punched my business for the last 2 years, NZ is quite strict on lockdowns. I decided I was going to adapt and take control. I had to detach from what I previously expected for my business. I started working in product genre (wine bottles), because it was something I could do from my studio without people. This is where my Liquid Macro Art journey begun.. the rest is NFT",
