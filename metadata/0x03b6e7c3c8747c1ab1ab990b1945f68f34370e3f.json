    "name": "Gamut Warning (SN1987A)",
    "description": "A gamut warning refers to a range of colors that cannot be reproduced within a CMYK (physical print process) color space. This warning imposes a default grey overlay over colors that cannot be properly converted into the physical world. This gamut warning  acts as documentation of the limitations of the physical world. It also represents an intense emotional energetic outrage that is beyond cognitive visibility.",
