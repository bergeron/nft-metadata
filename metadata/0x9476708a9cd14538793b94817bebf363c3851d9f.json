    "description": "\"The graffiti Vandal uses space to experience the city in a different but meaningful way, through self-mapping exercises, expressing the moments they experience through visual but non-verbal markers that many other community members do not communicate openly. Graffiti is a design exercise that encourages, whether or not it is actively participated in, stewardship with the urban landscape by finding liminal or in this case, Latent spaces as opportunities for communication, probing a reaction from the community.‚Äù",
