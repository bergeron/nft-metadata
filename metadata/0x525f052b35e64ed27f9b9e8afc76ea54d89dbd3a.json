    "description": "The Three Graces (i.e., a mythological figure representing the beneficial deities, daughters of Zeus, Euphrosyne, Thalia and Aglaea), bring luck, joy and lightheartedness. Mart Signed wants to give you hope for a better future in which humans naturally embrace diversity and in which beauty, joy and prosperity are part of your world and that of everyone. These are nine original artworks that differ in their color background but not in their meaning: it does not matter which is the context where you live, the only thing that matters is to live showing understanding and tolerance towards those around you.
