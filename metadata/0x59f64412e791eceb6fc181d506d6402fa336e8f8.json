    "description": "Firebird\nYassi Mazandi\n2021\nBorn-Porcelain Digital Video (color, sound)\n1280 x 720 (h,w)\n1 min 21 sec loop, 30 fps\nUnique (1/1)\n\nYassi has consistently been interested in connecting her handmade physical ceramic works to the digital realm and has been selectively scanning her artwork since 2004.  To date, all of Yassi’s video and NFT works are Born-Porcelain.\n\nFirebird (from her Shapeshifter series), an NFT completed in 2021, is a work based on X-Rays of one of her wheel-thrown and hand-carved porcelain flower-birds, a 2012 work entitled In Flight.  Yassi’s inspiration for Firebird came from inter-related childhood stories of mystical birds including the Persian Simurgh, the falcon, and the phoenix. \n\nThe video has been edited so that, if desired, it may be played on a continuous loop without any interruption.\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nwww.YassiMazandi.com\n\nVerisart Certified: \nhttps://verisart.com/works/yassi-mazandi-d7616679-6734-4b8c-a95d06818f1a2bf9\n",
