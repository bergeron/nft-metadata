    "description": "Do you think we all marvel at the origin point of something new? The original file name was \"Jesus-Fuck.gif\", because I could hardly believe what was happening in front of me. I suppose that's how a lot of us have been feeling at this time, what with the way things have been going. You can apply that to any short or long period of time, in this lifetime. The new is always startling. This new in particular, for me, stirred quite a controversy in myself and in my peers. Since starting this new path into GAN exploration I'm talking to a lot of my artistic peers in the physical realm about the validity, beauty, and consequences of AI in art. I suppose that's what led to my desire to blend my hand into the images, create structures that emulate what \"it\" would have created, but more so human, something tangible to the human spirit. Maybe I'm just not ready to fully trust my work in the hands of a machine, I said, typing into the machine I use to draw.",
