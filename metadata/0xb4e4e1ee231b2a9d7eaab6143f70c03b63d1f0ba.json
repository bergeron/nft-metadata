    "description": "\"She dances with fire every day, freely and sometimes pretending she has all the strength in the world.  She burns, she hurts, she falls, and she gets up and starts all over again.\n\nShe dances with fire every day, sometimes with her own flame, sometimes against a huge fire that she cannot stop.\" \n\nThis piece is a tribute to all women who face fires every day and who are not afraid of getting burned. The world can throw us against the flames, but we have the strength of a devastating fire inside of us.\n",
