    "description": "An archetype in film noir, femme fatale is a character who is dangerous, charming and seductive. Most see her as an image, yet she tends to reflect diametrical opposites of one's own assumed dominance. Femme fatale not only manipulates subjects, but she tweaks them in order to conjugate an on-edge reality. \n\nMusic and sound design: UÄŸurcan Sezen",
