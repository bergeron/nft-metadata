    "description": "The flowers I photograph are found outdoors - wild blooms gathered in meadows and forests, or grown in my yard or picked on walks in the neighborhood. I look for the tiniest blossoms that could never be found in shops or bouquets. Some are smaller than 1cm, but under the microscopic lens their intricate shapes emerge.\nThis photograph is of a small blossom from a wisteria vine that grows in my yard. The scent of the blooms is honey sweet, and they drip in clusters like grapes. Up close, the tight petals reveal intricate curves dusted with pollen.",
