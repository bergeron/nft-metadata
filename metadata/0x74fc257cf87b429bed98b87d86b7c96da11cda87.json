    "description": "It was a rainy day on the northern coast of France when I took this picture as a really long exposure. I added the rain again in the post production to give the picture his rainy feeling back which was not visible anymore because of the long exposure time. For me, creating pictures is all about feelings. And I do everything it needs, to transport them to the viewer.",
