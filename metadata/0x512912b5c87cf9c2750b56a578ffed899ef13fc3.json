    "description": "A phenomenon in which a large group of people share a false memory of a past event or detail.\n\nThe Mandela Effect is often explained as a form of collective misremembering, where people's memories become distorted or conflated over time. Some theories suggest that the Mandela Effect is caused by parallel universes or alternate realities, where events may have played out differently than they did in our own reality.\n\nBy Hackerman",
