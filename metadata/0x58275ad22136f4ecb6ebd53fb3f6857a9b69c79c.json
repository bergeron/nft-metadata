    "description": "Day break. The first deep breath of fresh but salty air. One wave catches its first warmth of sun, then the next, and the next. Away from asphalt ridden journeys, civilization starts the day with a slow rise. An appreciation for where they are, at that exact moment. No worries about what the calendar shows. With one more deep breath, as the shallow grazers peek down the island, the entire shoreline is gently kissed by the sun. The day has begun. The stories ashore are being written in first light. \n\nPhoto taken on 35mm Portra 400.",
