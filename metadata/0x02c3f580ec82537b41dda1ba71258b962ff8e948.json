    "description": "I began developing a new series, Roots, after the beginning of a full-scale invasion. \nThe common misfortune has awakened in Ukrainians some unknown code, everyone even in the most distant part of the world felt the call of their own land, their identity and their freedom. The work during the war and it's about spirit, the power of roots and the connection between us. \nIn the new works, I continue the journey of discovering the inner self that he began in his previous series, \"The Giant. In Roots, I reflect on the self on another level, now as part of a community, and look for new associations of identity that will not be based solely on the concept of the nation. I offer new images of ideology based on fantasy, where I reveal about subconscious spiritual symbols and show how they are subtly sewn inside us. \n",
