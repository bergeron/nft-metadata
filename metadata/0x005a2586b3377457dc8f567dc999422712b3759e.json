    "description": "Deep down we all know  \nnone of us know what’s coming.  \nWe pretend, yes, we pretend  \nwe all know where we’re going.  \nBut from our boots,  \nthose hidden truths  \nreveal their inner meanings  \nof just how frightening it can be to know  \nthat we cannot ever fully know  \nhow another’s boots are fitting.\n\nI like to think you can find life in everything.  \nAnd for me the harder riddle to decipher  \nis why it came to be.  \nBut lately, I figure  \nas long as I’m here,  \nI might as well enjoy the scenery —  \ntake in all the journey has to show,  \nperhaps find out some answers down below,  \nand all the while keep on questioning.\n\nAnd how is it we’ve forgotten  \nwe all navigate this world through a lens?  \nWhen I speak up I’m disruptive,  \nand when I’m silent I’m enabling a mess.  \nAnd if I’m honest,  \nwhat worries me more  \nthan history’s dictators and corrupt presidents  \nis the notion that somewhere along the line,  \ndespite our connectivity,  \nwe’ve lost our ability  \nto connect.\n\nAnd I finally figured out  \nI can’t control  \nwhat you think of me,  \nso I’ll stop trying —  \ncash out all my poker chips and go,  \nbuild myself a mountain worth climbing.\n\nSometimes I catch myself  \ntrying to make predictions.  \nTurns out half the time I’m wrong,  \nbut half the time I’m right, so I go with it.  \n‘Cause even if/when,  \nin the end,  \nthe world has fallen to pieces,  \nwell at least I’ll know I tried to grow,  \nsee what lies beyond the open road,  \nand our current vision.\n\nAnd I finally figured out  \nI can’t control  \nwhat you think of me,  \nso I’ll stop trying —  \ncash out all my poker chips and go,  \nbuild myself a mountain worth climbing.\n\nCash out all my poker chips and go,  \nbuild myself a mountain worth climbing,  \nbuild myself a mountain worth climbing,  \nbuild myself a mountain worth climbing.\n\n------------  \nThe Builder  \nMusic & Lyrics by Mike Bass  \nCopyright © 2022\n\n------------  \nCollectors of this NFT may also receive the WAV and MP3 files of The Builder, along with a 3000 x 3000 pixel JPG of the artwork if interested.
