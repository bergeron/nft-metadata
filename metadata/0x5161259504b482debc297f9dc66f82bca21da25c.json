    "description": "The Cognitive Dissonance collection is created & assistance by A.I Generative algorithms through proprietary neural networks which are applied to my self portrait. In this case we see 1 painting that has 2 conflicting beliefs. This inconsistency between what is seen & believed is designed for the viewer to interpret 1 image out of many variations.\n\nIn this new variation series \"Cognitive Dissonance= Ω\", I explore the deconstruction of each animation, examining every frame & choosing to reveal a hidden process behind the assisted Neural network behavior. By doing this, I intend to show you how the long process of painting an original self portrait, moving to digital, & to assisted AI & creating a frame by frame animation that distorts your perception, is done. Revealing AI is not a simple filter or technique, but a tool to behold, helping us create NEW art forms that have never been imagined before. Much like a brush once was. Or I may just do this Var, 1 of 1. Stay tuned to find out.",
