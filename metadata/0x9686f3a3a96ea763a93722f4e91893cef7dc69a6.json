    "description": "Life on lava.\nIt is either the end of the earth or the beginning of creation.\nI took these photos while climbing an active volcano Batur in Bali, Indonesia. Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, itâ€™s an area with a high degree of tectonic activity. Indonesian people have to cope with the constant risk of volcanic eruptions. But in spite of that they still choose to live nearby a sleeping monster.\nBeing raised in the city with no risk of natural cataclysms, it always excites and terrifies me how people can live near active volcanos and refuse to leave.\nThese people drive motorcycles to the top of volcano every day to pray and make offering to Mt. Batur, there is a temple on the top too. They also deliver tourists and some stuff to sell on the top to make a living.\nBalinese people believe that the volcano can give them abundance, but also can wipe out of existence the whole island. That is the life of full acceptance and obedience to the law of Mother Nature.",
