    "description": "The state of relaxation and wonderment experienced while gazing upon the stars. An image I created from 2 of my photos taken at the same location which is one of the darkest places in the UAE. \n\nI visit this place often to sit under the stars. Light pollution has taken over the dark skies. Mostly we all have lost our connections to night skies. I only wish I lived in such a place where I could spend more time (maybe every night) under the dark skies . \n\n\nPhotographer: Waheed Akhtar\n\nSize: 4800 x 3200 @300dpi\n\n\nImage Type: Composite\n\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
