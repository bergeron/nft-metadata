    "description": "Blue Suitcase \n\nI planned a trip the other day\nThe preparation was thorough and true\nI unpacked for this trip. \nEverything that was too heavy to move\nPhotos of family gatherings,\nThe love that was shared, \nHappy Birthdays left aside,\nHugs from all who had cared, \nThese smiles are not needed,  \nThe baby book can stay too, \nMy trip does not need \nhappy baggage from you  \nI am packing one thing\nin this suitcase of blue \nThe one thing I packed\nWas my life \nWithout you\n\n     Written and Recorded without a studio or paying other people to make me sound good.\n\n      I wrote this while in a Twitter space supporting NFT artists. This was inspired by an artist who had the idea to end their life just like I have thought of before. Be kind to one another. Show love and support. ",
