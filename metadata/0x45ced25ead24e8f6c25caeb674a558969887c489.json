    "description": "“Red Shot” is the NFT created by the collaborative duo Vedovamazzei to approach to the digital world. The red color shoots the monochrome as metaphor of the world where we live. It soaks the environment and enters your imagination, your visual and sensorial perception. The communicative way of Vedovamazzei of doing art always makes you watch and look for an answer to your existential questions. Their storytelling is always continuously moving and mutating. Their works are made of different styles and genres having a strong cultural background. You are truly watching their art moving.",
