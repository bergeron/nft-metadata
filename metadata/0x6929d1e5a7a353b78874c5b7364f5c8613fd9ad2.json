    "description": "One of them is this photo; Iâ€™m grateful to take it with this person because maybe I was very selfish in the past, and I had time to feel the loss of someone who was always there for me.\n\nFinally, the second chance came again. Finally, we were able to communicate again & became close. But it turns out that I am still selfish, and there are still many things that I think only for my sake.\nLike this photo that closes my eyes, that's what I do. I close my eyes to anything; I want to see & know what I think is true.\n\nWithout thinking about the consequences, maybe this second chance will be lost again, and I won't get another chance to share stories & other things with her.\n\nMaybe this photo looks normal to you, but this photo means a lot to me because on the way here, I had to go through several things, such as debates and emotions that I had to control.\n\nAnd I hope I don't miss this second chance! Even if I have to lose the opportunity & the people I love, I don't know how to deal with it!",
