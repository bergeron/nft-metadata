    "description": "This artwork is the result of my work, which has nature as its main theme, and artificial intelligence, which has reinterpreted these plants, giving them new meanings and colors.\nI wanted to deepen the concept that our society currently puts us in dichotomy with our fellow men, or you are with or you are against, vax - novax, black and white, good and bad, creating contrasts that seem unsolvable. But underground these plants, which seem distant, talk to each other, intertwine their roots in the common soil.\n",
