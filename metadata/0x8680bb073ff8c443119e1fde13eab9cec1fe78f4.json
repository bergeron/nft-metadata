    "description": "My second song on Sound is another oldie.\nWritten in 2018, during a time where all I was writing was melancholic tunes, \"Your Mother\" stood out as a little tongue in cheek gem, ironic and direct at the same time.\n\nI'm Italian and blunt. But I am also romantic, and just like many of us, I look for love. And so many times, when we think we found it, it turns out to be not what we expected. \n\nI do like to take things lightly though, and music allows me to do it even more. Melodies and lyrics help me turn something upsetting into something that makes me (and maybe others) smile.\n\nThis is a one take acoustic recording of my song \"Your Mother\" with my friend Ed Prosek on trumpet. \nOnce again I feel so blessed that web3 allows me to put out songs that were written such a long time ago, and were never given a chance to see the light of day. Well now they can shine, and find a home with you guys.\n",
