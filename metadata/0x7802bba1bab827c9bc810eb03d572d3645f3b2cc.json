    "description": "A diary from an unknown observer:\n\n\"One day, in the middle of winter, my family was walking amidst a snowstorm in the thawed forest. We were searching for a way out of the forest when our youngest suddenly fell sick. \n\nIt was in a moment of desperation that we met her, the Shepherd. When she saw our condition, without any hesitation nor question, she asked us to get on the back of a stag that I didn’t even realise its existence until she mentioned it to us. The only explanation the Shepherd gave us was to not worry, for she will aide us to find the nearest village.\n\nEverything went so fast and blurry after that. I didn’t recall any details beside how she had helped us.\n\nBut I do remember two things. The first was that she introduced herself as a shepherd despite a lack of cattle. And then the second was, before she came to us, I saw her dancing with a creature with such strange features.\"\n\n♧ Model: Vivian \n\nA4 | 300 dpi | Clip Studio Paint",
