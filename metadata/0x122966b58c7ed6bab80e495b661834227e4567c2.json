    "description": "Collaboration with Alexander Makarov and Alexander Sokolov\nAs part of the work \"G. Mellonella Action, we turned to the recycling of polyethylene and polypropylene. By the end of 2015, the amount of all plastic waste reached 5800 million tons. There is so much plastic waste that it seems that this waste is starting to take on a life of its own. They “capture” cities, move along roads, drawn by the wind, create islands in the Pacific Ocean, break up into small pieces under the influence of the environment, turning into microplastics. Waste takes the form of complex global networks, developing at times the most\nin an unexpected way. To take control of these\ncomplex processes and prevent an ecological catastrophe\nsociety needs awareness and awareness. A task\nproject - updating the problem of recycling\nplastic waste and finding a solution to the problem.\nWe will donate a portion of the proceeds to\n\"SahaXenos\" so that they can\ncontinue your research.",
