    "name": "Of Lions And Lambs",
    "description": "The Lamb constitutes the female and the multi-layered complexity and beauty they retain within their hearts. Keys to the heart will only be given after the complexity is simplified. Notice her eyes, touched with sparkling glitter, meant to symbolize those eyes you see once in a lifetime, and are never likely to see again. Her lips, ready to kiss, but entranced within the shield of a golden aura. The eyes are a portal to peer into a womanâ€™s mind or soul. To listen, and through listening you unlock the true passion, beauty, and sparkle within. The Lion, the male, contains multitudes, different construction in very different places from the Lamb. To unlock the Lion, a different deduction of the complexity must take place. Universal truths uncovered. Only then the most beautiful ideals this world are born--true love and connection--as the Lion leans in to kiss the Lamb. This painting uses oil on a very large canvas, as well as metallic and basic acrylic, glitter, and nail polish. 1/1.",
