The previous day with a few minutes left until launch, an authorized Royal Caribbean cruise-liner left port during the launch window. These ships are suppose to be so far away from the coast to continue with the mission and caused a huge situation for the teams. The ship was directly behind the life guard stand as well, so was more than ecstatic to reshoot the following day for the launch.\n\nShot, Edited, and Color Graded by The Space Toast\n1/1 Edition",
