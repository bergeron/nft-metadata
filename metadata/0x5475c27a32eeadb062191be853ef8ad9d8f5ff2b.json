    "description": "‘Overthinking’ is an eerie, vulnerable, and almost desperate ballad. It captures the exact feelings of being an overthinker. Being swamped with your own bad thoughts that are oftentimes untrue. Needing reassurance from the person you’re thinking about.\n\nThis song was so therapeutic and relieving for me to make. The timing of this song was perfect. At that particular moment, I was so overwhelmed with emotions I couldn't make sense of. I couldn't tell if what was going on in my mind was true, or if I was just creating a false narrative in my head. There was no one around me who knew what I’d specifically felt. There was no song for me to play that related to my exact state.\n\nSo I made my own.\n\nI started with some simple chords on the keyboard. Just two of them. What caught my ear was the bass within the sound of the piano, and I left it at that. I didn’t know what to start off with lyrically. So I just started recording and sang whatever I felt.\n\n“Why don’t you talk to me”. A simple phrase, yet so intriguing. It makes you think: where was I going with this? I kept up the improvisation and went back afterwards, changing some lyrics and melodies. I didn’t write down one lyric on my phone during this. It was just straight from my emotions. I never want to hold back in my music. I want to say what I feel.\n\nLike many of my songs, they’re personal to me. They all have a story. But like many of us, we all feel heartbreak, desire, longing. And we want to be understood. We want to know that we’re not alone. Words cannot describe how healing this song was for me to make.\n\n‘Overthinking’ is the perfect song for those whose mind wanders. For those whose minds are too loud. For those who need reassurance. For those who want to be understood. ‘Overthinking’ is perfect for overthinkers. I hope you’re able to feel some comfort, and feel some emotion :)\n\n- Mia Lailani <3",
