    "description": "This file contains all pages of my self-published book, \"Veiled Observations and Reflections\" (2002). Because I wanted to keep the design and edit intact, I had to make one JPEG file from PDF of the book. You are welcome to download the file and enlarge it on your screen. If that is not good enough, I am happy to send you better JPEGs in separate files.  In addition, I have the actual book that I saved for my personal keep.  It has a 7x7 silver gelatin print of \"White Terns, Midway Atoll\" that I made in the darkroom. ",
