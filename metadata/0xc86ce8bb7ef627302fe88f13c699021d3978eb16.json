    "description": "This is 1 NFT in collection of 12 photographs that have been issued as a single, unique edition.\n\nPhoto: 7882  x  5260 px \n\nThese photos were taken during a trip to the island of Bali.\n\nThe idea of the collection is to show the inhabitants of the island in their everyday life. Life among nature. Or does nature live among people? The lines and patterns of the plants in these pictures are life itself.\n\nThanks to the black and white photography and the leica q2 camera, it's as if the image is breathing.",
