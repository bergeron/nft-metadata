    "description": "Strange is the way sometimes everything befalls. The obsession becomes stronger with every passing moment reckoning the past. The hefty loads of resentment and scars fall on the shoulder suddenly, like a thud.\n\nAll the hues and hurdles thee suffered yet the weight of resentment hit hard. Wherever thee go, it haunts like a shadow of secrets and mysteries. Moving forward and finding peace but again out of blue, everything falls apart, like a thud. yet, thee revive.\n\nCertain things in life are far away of human will. when it is supposed to happen, it happens. Whetever the reason, sometimes things fall apart leaving the story in between, the mystery behind, where the hurdles are to befall, yet whispering in the ears, and everything at once, like a thud.\n\nThud is a collection of random yet closely connected generative art which strangely express the inner fear of human beings over certain unpredictables that befalls on life.\n\nArt type: Generative\nDimension: 10000 x 9000\nCreated using: p5.js"
