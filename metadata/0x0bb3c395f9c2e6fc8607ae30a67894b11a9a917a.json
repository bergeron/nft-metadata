    "description": "Ever since Aristotle, thinkers have been struggling with this most confounding and elusive of philosophical questions 'What then, is time?'A constant flow of moments marking past, present and future.Time is a thing perceived, there is either never enough of it or it is painfully slow. We cannot escape it, as it consistently reminds us that one day is ending and another is on the horizon. Time dictates when we should get married, have children, and retire. Time is money. Lost time is never found. Healing is a matter of time, sometimes. Time is wasted when not valued. Time is precious. Time expands and contracts. Time is running out for the environment. My time will come. Your time will come. Timeâ€™s up.",
