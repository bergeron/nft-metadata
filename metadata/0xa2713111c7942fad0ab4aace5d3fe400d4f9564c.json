    "description": "The frame from a real life story \nIn the Battle of Gallipoli, it is reported that sometimes the trenches gets so closer that the distance becomes as short as 10 meters.\nAn Anzac soldier, injured in the battle between the Turks and the Anzacs, falls in front of his own trench. All the soldiers no matter Turks or Anzacs suddenly stop firing, but none of them can move to grab the wounded soldier. Then, one of the Turkish soldiers with his white flag, walks to the other trench, takes the wounded soldier and carries him on his back to the Anzac trenches. None of the soldiers fires at each other until they return to their own trench, as if they had a secret contract. This striking event has become an inspiring issue of the sculptures in the region where the war took place, and has almost become a symbol of the humanitarian aspects of Anzac and Turkish soldiers. Consequently, I have also used this work as the essential photograph in this exhibition.\nThis piece is the first one in my NFT story",
