    "description": "During what felt like a spell of never-ending rain in 2022, we had one faithful day where the clouds disappeared and faint slivers of colour started to show in the sky. I almost didn't let myself believe it may turn into a half decent sunset, but sure enough, those slivers of colour quickly turned into one of the best sunsets I'd seen in months. \n\nThis piece serves as a reminder that even when things aren't going to plan, better days are right around the corner. \n\nLocation: One Mile Beach, Port Stephens, NSW",
