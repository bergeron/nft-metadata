    "description": "11\" x 14\" acrylic on canvas with stainless steel piercing jewelry. \n\nThis piece is several years in the making reaching back long before I ever recognized myself as an artist. First conceptualized in 2019 as a digital drawing, I chose to revisit the piece in 2022 on a journey of collaboration with my younger self. 'A Balanced Breakfast' is the first piece I have painted on canvas and marks a pivotal point of freedom and authenticity for me in my self and career; the freedom to make mistakes, the freedom to trust myself, and most importantly the freedom to indulge. \n\nPhysical piece can be claimed upon mint. \n\nEat up!",
