    "name": "Oz",
    "description": "She was sadly lost in thought, trying to figure out what to do now, but the only thing on her mind was how much wanted to draw.  Suddenly remembered that when she was a child, her Mom had told her about a wizard and three strange figures who went to Emerald City with a little girl to help them. If she remembered correctly, maybe one of them needed a brain...What if she tried to go to him too? Maybe he can conjure a new arm also. \nShe packed and set off.\nUnfortunately, she didn't remember the end of the story, so had no idea that Oz wouldn't be able to solve her problem.\n\n3000x4343 px\n300 dpi\n3D art",
