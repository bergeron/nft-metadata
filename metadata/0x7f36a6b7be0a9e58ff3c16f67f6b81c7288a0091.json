    "description": "Zaphaestus is the most sought after metal-worker and artisan in all of Mount Zap. His atelier is held together by intricate workings of fire magic, imbuing the space with volcanic potential.\n\nHe splits his time between furnishing the Acropolis of Zapeus with intricate sculptures, equipping the Synthetix Spartans with the Zapperverse's most sophisticated weaponry, and performing maintenance on Zapper Terminators to keep them in tip-top-shipping-shape.\n\nZaphaestus' dearest ambition is to pass his skills on to all inhabitants of the Zapperverse, so that the imaginative energy of its citizens may be leveraged."
