    "description": "AGNOSIA uses an EEG brainwave scanner that collects biological data in real-time while specific documented memories from the past are presented to the artist.\nThe collected data is used to train an artificial intelligence algorithm to control the playback and generate audiovisual elements. A software developed in Touchdesigner that processes collected data with creative programming techniques will generate new point clouds based on previously 3D scanned spaces. This process will produce the visual elements of the installation and will continuously regenerate, making new models that explore spatial memory.\n\nThis work is a rendered video version from one of the spaces the software has generated and developed through the real-time process.\n\nhttps://aliphi.com/agnosia",
