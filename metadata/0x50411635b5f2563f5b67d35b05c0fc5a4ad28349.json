    "description": "Whoever has never appropriated nature and integrated into it with altered consciousness, the day he has God in front of his eyes, he will not recognize him. In the dance of life, many cultures have used plants as forms of ritual. At the end of the game the heart is the portal to the higher fields of consciousness, not the mind. The mind is the channel, but from the heart is that we are all united in unison with a single heartbeat.",
