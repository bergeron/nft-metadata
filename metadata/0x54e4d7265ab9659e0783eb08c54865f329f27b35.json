    "name": "Poor Mr. X",
    "description": "What if we were all given the same opportunities? Perhaps we could all have a chance to see our dreams come true. Perhaps the world could be a much better place to live in. Perhaps we could all afford not to go to bed on an empty stomach. Perhaps we could all afford to fight the demons that drive us insane or those that make us lose sleep. \n\nButâ€¦\n\nLife is just so disproportionate. The poor stay poor with rags of their dreams hanging on their souls while the rich get richer and sleep on silk dreams within a dream. Life seems so unfortunate, especially down here in Africa where Mr. X perhaps could have been a doctor, pilot, engineer or some other white-collar Sir. Only if he was given the chance to follow his dream.",
