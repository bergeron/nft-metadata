    "description": "3072 x 1536 are the dimensions of this piece. I've always been interested in ambiguity. This is abstract, though our mind really wants to link it to something real, a texture or even a place. Of course, the viewer will bring their own experiences and interpretations to the painting, but ultimately, the true meaning of the artwork lies in the eye of the beholder.\n\nI find that abstract art allows for a unique kind of freedom and creativity. Unlike representational art, where the artist is bound by the constraints of depicting a specific subject or scene, abstract art allows the artist (and the audience!) to let their imagination run wild and create something truly unique and original.\n",
