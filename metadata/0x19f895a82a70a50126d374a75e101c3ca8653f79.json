    "description": "A theme-song for the independent artist.\n\nMy mission with this song was to speak to those that question and challenge their existence in every sense of their being. There may be those that know this already, but just as a reminder, to reach success, whatever that word means, you must rid yourself of doubt and fear. Sometimes companionship and bet on yourself. All for the pursuit of happiness.\n\nWhen we rid ourselves of limitations and take leaps of faith, those roads traveled are uniquely our own. It may be lonely and get dark at times, but one thing is for sure, finding that love, existing in it, whether external or self-love.\n\nIt's fuel, passion, and enough to help you reach fulfillment. \n\nIn support of the independent artists on here, I know how challenging all of this truly is. The collector that wins the golden egg - will receive 10% of the primary sale. I encourage you to pay it forward and support more artists in this space by minting their MusicNFTs.\n\nThank You.\n",
