    "description": "Alec told me...\n\nExclusive collaboration between Alec King and chillpill. \n\nRecorded at Record Plant during the ChillRx Mint sessions - February 2022.\n\nFollow Alec King on:\n\nsound.xyz - https://www.sound.xyz/alecking\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/aleckingmusic\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/aleckingmusic/\n\n\"That’s A Wrap\" by Alec King & chillpill was incepted in Los Angeles during the ChillRx Mint Sessions at Record Plant in early 2022. It was actually made during an event chillpill had so it was no normal session. Alec shared, \"this was definitely the first time I had literally 40 people in the studio while making a song. I know the energy is high on this one because it was created with that energy. We got to find that footage...\"\n\nThe song starts and ends with Alec's brother, Jon Kupper, saying \"Alec told me…\" which sets the stage for Alec to bring his lyricism and unique punch lines. You’ll have to listen to hear the advice Jon shared there after the dot dot dot. That’s all mixed with hard hitting hip-hop production from chillpill and KAJÉ. The sample keeps the track moving and allows for Alec to flow in and out with his combination of rapping and singing.\n\nThis track is the first collaboration between the 2 artists, and is certainly the \"title track\" to wrap up 2022.",
