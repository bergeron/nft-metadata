    "description": "Long ago, the country was terrorized by the most feared creature, a dragon. The dragon would destroy towns and harm the lives of people. The people began to search for a warrior to save them.\n\nFinally, a young and brave warrior emerged. His name was Arslan. Arslan decided to fight against the dragon to save everyone's lives. With a powerful sword and his bravery, he found the dragon and the battle began.\n\nThe dragon was very powerful against Arslan, but he never gave up. He fought fearlessly and finally defeated the dragon. The towns were safe now, and the lives of the people were no longer in danger.\n\nArslan was praised by the people for his courage and heroism. He became a hero of the people, ready to fight against other dangerous creatures.\n\n-Music By Sir Cubworth-",
