    "description": "During this trip to the desert I felt a sense of nostalgia, chaos and pure awe as far as my eyes could see. \n\nThis composition is about the textures within its layers, complex yet minimally serene. With powerful winds heading towards the peak, I decided to experiment with a moody bright blue moon light illuminating the desert. \n\nWhile making the music, I wanted to encapsulate the feeling I had at that very moment while I was shooting. I invite you to imagine yourself traveling along these dunes. Let the sounds immerse you in the world and make the images float with life.",
