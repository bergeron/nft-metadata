    "description": "A Genesis Explorer of Brilliance belonging to house Sage, which is of a Light attunement.\n\n[ Before the new races emerged, or the world as we know it shaped into what it is today, there were deities and protectors of the land. Not much is known about them apart from the stories and legends passed down through generations. These deities and beings are known as The Genesis Explorers ]\n\nGenesis Explorers are powerful adventurers endowed with magic & power of its ancestral order, resurrected from Genesis Loot bags which contain a complete set of 8 items belonging to the same Order. There are 16 original Orders of the Lootverse, all of which are categorized under the 4 Great Houses of the Explorer Realm: Valiant, Sage, Warsworn, & Spectre. There can only ever be 2,540 Genesis Explorers in existence. Putting a twist on the classic RPG style with chunky lines and juicy colors, each Explorer's design is influenced by the loot they carry mixed in with elements such as distinct classes & cool backdrops, all attached to uniquely generated name.",
