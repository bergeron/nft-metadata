    "description": "This is a sad soul and a helpless tragedy. Among the many nightmares, \"Hypocrisy\" is not dangerous, and may even be helpful to your journey. They look more than Other nightmares are too close to humans, and they unexpectedly get close to humans, and will guide travelers from time to time. Travelers who fight with monsters day after day will inevitably have a sense of \"Hypocrisy\", but I repeat, these souls are a tragedy, \"Hypocrisy\" cannot be freed, these sad souls wander around day after day, no matter what they look like, they hold a mysterious scripture, talk to themselves, and the language is fragmented. It’s hard to understand, they long for liberation from this endless life, so they teach people to pray, they help travelers, because these tiny creatures are the only existence in this world that can reach the “end”.",
