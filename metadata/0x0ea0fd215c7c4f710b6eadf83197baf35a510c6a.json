    "description": "Ashin is a small ancient village in the central desert of Persia, located at 250 Km north-east of capital city of Isfahan Province. Ashin lacks any infrastructure and technology and it is 50 Km far from the closest neighbor town, Anarak.\n\nAshin, with a history of approximately 1700 years, is uniquely valuable due to its organic architecture, strategic location, and its substantially contribution to survival of the route known as \"the artery of civilization\" which connects the southern cities to the Silk Road. However, Ashin was one of the villages that lost their role due to the industrialization and urbanization and the subsequent elimination of the Caravan routes and major changes in the roads. As a result, Ashin was abandoned for almost 40 year and most of the structures were demolished.\n\nMozhgan Bagheri, an architect, decided to conserve Ashin with all of its incredible history before its total destruction. Ashin was registered as a National Heritage Site by Mozhgan in 2014.\n",
