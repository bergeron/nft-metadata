    "description": "The meaning of TABULA RASA is the mind in its hypothetical primary blank or empty state before receiving outside impressions.\n\nMy works capture and question reality with a poetic visual language, offering glimpses into the convergence of artificial and everyday lives.\n\nRooted in post-photography, my approach incorporates generative and AI art to challenge traditional notions. I explore the interplay between focus and spontaneity, reflecting my fascination with a blank canvas and the transformative power of art.\n\n4096x4096 px PNG  \nYear: 2023\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
