    "description": "Mirror mirror on the wall, or was it a magic mirror after all? Tales from the past, from glass slippers to poisoned apples, are living through the ages, ever evolving as they pass down generations. Tales told around camp fires, whispered as bedtime stories; the magic of them will never fade away.  \n\nThis magic mirror of day and night, carved out of stories untold, it is not quite what it seems. Sit still and lean closer; the magic it holds reveals itself for those who wait till the day has ended. Every midnight, when the clock strokes twelve, the magic of the mirror comes alive! Sadly, like dreams, well, I'm afraid the magic won't last forever. After a full cycle of time, the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before. But don't worry! Every night as the time is right, stories come back alive.",
