    "description": "Infinite Horizon Over a Glittering Sea\n \nProfessor Dong Ya’s review of Liminal Space (extract)\n \n“Georgina’s series of works express the integration of time and space. It is difficult to draw great mountains and rivers with limited ink. Georgina’s painting strokes, in which ink and water are blended together, are vivid and lively, simultaneously dry and wet. Her ethereal and flowing compositions from the scatter perspective with the eye of her heart is the spirit of Chinese ink and water with the form of Western modern constructivism.\n \nThe internalised emotions of the human mind can interact with external objects and can be translated in the form of paintings through the externalisation of the human heart. The focus of her paintings lies in this philosophy, like that of the moon in the water and the image in the mirror. This is the sublime out of the painting, which is liminal.”\n \n5440 x 5440 px\n3.3MB",
