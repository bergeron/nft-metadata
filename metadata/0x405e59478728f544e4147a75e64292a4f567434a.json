    "description": "The reason I fell in love with a minimalistic touch to my photography was because I felt like my emotions came through the piece and spoke them the clearest.

Therefore these pieces have no description\n\nThis piece comes with a signed print with a format and size of your choosing.\n\nSize: 2514 x 3352\n",
