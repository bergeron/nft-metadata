    "description": "How afraid of the darkness?\n\nI thought I wasn't afraid until my life became uncertain for the first time. Uncertainty is a huge black hole that swallows you whole! I guess I should admit that I'm 31 years old and the things I've always wanted to do for the sake of my dreams were crystal clear. \n\nI would draw and desire a specific roadmap. If you have patience and perseverance, I believe you can call it done!\n\nPS: You can't even fall in love if you're that radical!\n\nThis photo belongs to these days when I have overcome my radicalism and come out of my darkness!\n\n'' In the deep darkness, only the person sees the light.''  â€” Chuang Tzu",
