    "description": "I am Me is an animated self portrait of the artist. A 1/1 that will become part of 8 NFT's specifically produced for the FDN collection \"Being Human\" in 2022.\n\nA piece that reflects the self doubt and anxiety that can creep in when trying to live up to the expectations of others. Oh what it is to be truly accepted, understood and loved by others. \n\n\"As we pass through life we must find our people and our tribe. I know that my tribe exists because I have run with them before. One day I will lie on the hills with you again my friends and we will play music, smoke cigarettes, look at the clouds and laugh until the break of dawn. And I will feel I am me again.\" CharlieART\n\nDigital hand drawn NFT\n\n",
