    "description": "Each Rise Above It piece shows a metaphorical image of something me the artist had to overcome to take the photo. This was an early Sunday morning I had planned to sleep in. Yet my cat awoke me at dawn and I looked out the window to see an amazing fog. I was out of the house in 10 minutes. On the ferry boat in 10 more. Met with a friends I haven’t explored with previously and got on top of this building quick enough to view the top of this fog that I had woken up in. It is hard to get out of bed some days. It is hard to live life to the fullest when the land of sleep demands 8 hours from you for the other 16 to be tolerable. This morning I was back down from eating breakfast by the time the alarm on my iPhone rang at the intended time of awakening. Grateful for the early mornings when I’m able to overcome my body’s need for comfort, in the ethereal fog of sleep. \n\n/EM1T",
