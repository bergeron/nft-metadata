    "description": "A man in traditional Hasidic garb walks alone in Brooklyn, NY.  (March - 2022)\n\nWe live in a world that is always connected. Connected to phones, computers, and each other. It's an amazing time for technological advances, and yet I find myself craving solitude. Time away from these things.\n\nThis gentleman struck me as completely content. Happy to walk alone with his thoughts. As humans, we need social interaction, but we also need balance in our lives. Solitary moments - like this image - are a consistent theme across my photographic work. Exploring these isolated moments brings me peace, and I hope that same calmness comes across with \"Content\".
