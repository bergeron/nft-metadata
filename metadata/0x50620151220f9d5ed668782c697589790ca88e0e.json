    "description": "we're back bitches\nwe made this 3/28/20 and it still fucks\n\nafter we made this one there was a moment of HOLY SHIT look what we did.. \nthat hook.. (insert water squirt emoji) \npulling the rest of the production straight out of our Skrillex handbook, we created Loose Ends\n\nwe love the juxtaposition of acoustic lofi and overly produced electronic rock. loose ends has always been one of our favorites and excited to see if this demo evolves into something even saucier. \n\nWHAT IS WORKS OF PROGRESS\nwe are tapping into our vault of early demos to release a series on sound.xyz... new drop every few weeks\n\nsome of these songs may evolve and be released traditionally and some not.. but these early versions will live forever on Sound and we love them.\n\none thing we’ve come to enjoy is while learning what this band is and how to make music for it, we made many “mistakes” sonically. we wanted to make big rock guitar sounds but had to learn how to do that first. In the tinkering and toying with sounds, sometimes something new would be created.. obstacles make opportunity and that is where the magic lies. \n\nhere is loos ends.. the second of the works of progress series \n\n\n\n\n",
