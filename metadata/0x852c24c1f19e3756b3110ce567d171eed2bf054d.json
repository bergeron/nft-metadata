    "description": "Genesis piece.\n\nA shortfin mako shark leaps gracefully from the golden dusk waters of Pukerua Bay in Aotearoa, before the smooth hills of Kapiti Island. \n\nThe vista depicted is from the black volcanic beach upon which I was conceived by an overenthusiastic pair of neurodivergent MƒÅori teenagers for whom the most appropriate choice was to give me up for adoption.\n\nInitially rendered in acrylic on canvas, then digitally enhanced, the original painting is owned by my birth mother.
