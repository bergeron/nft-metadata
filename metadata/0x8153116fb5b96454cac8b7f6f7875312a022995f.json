    "description": "Life is a constant journey involving learning, discovery, adventure as well as challenges. These challenges help us define who we are by the choices we make when facing them. Sometimes it feels like we're in a fog and can't see where we're going or what's the point of it all. \n\nEvery now and then we get a chance to get above the clouds and remember what we're striving for and the beauty that exists when we calm our minds. \n\nGateway to Nirvana might be a physical place, a gateway between realms, or a place inside of us. Whenever we get a glimpse of it's beauty then we know that we've been given a gift of clarity and inspiration.",
