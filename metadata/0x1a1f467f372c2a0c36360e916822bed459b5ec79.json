    "description": "Between leaving one land and arriving at another, sadness and excitement are constantly alternating. So plunge yourself into the sea, as it knows where to take you. It knows whom it should deliver you to and what awaits you. \n\nSo turn your face towards the sun, the future, and the fruitful land that awaits you. What you seek is not in these treacherous waters anymore. \n\nDo not think of this as the start of your journey or that you are saying goodbye. So look once more, and you will see;\n\nThink not of this as a departure, but it is an arrival. You are about to reach the lands you have sought for many moons. Today, welcoming you is this sun-kissed moss-covered statue. This immortalized entity has received many before you, and today, this goddess says to you; \n\n\"There will always be new shores to explore as long as you refuse to sink.\" \n\nCan you hear her?\n\nVisual Artist : Cihan Engin\nMusic : parabolamusic",
