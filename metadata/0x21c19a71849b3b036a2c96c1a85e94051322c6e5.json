    "description": "Asiatic Lions have their last home in the Gir forest of Gujarat in India. Once widespread over Asia and the Middle East, they were hunted and killed in large numbers. Other environmental factors like deforestation reduced their numbers to less than 200 in the late 19th century and were restricted to the Gir forest region. But with support from the local community and the Forest department, considerable efforts to save the last of what remains have been successful. Their numbers are rising gradually to more than 700 or more as per the latest census.\n\nThis image is of Asiatic Lion cub who is the future generation. He might grow into a mighty ruler of the jungle one day.  \nThis edition is dedicated to them and an attempt to spread a word their story. ",
