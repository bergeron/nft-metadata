    "description": "Even with all the recent evidence, we do not yet know for sure if aliens exist and have visited our planet, but it seems possible given the vastness of space-time and the vastness of reality we have yet to discover and understand... Our successive collections of Alien art represent what we imagine it could be like if even one governmental body or an individual managed to extract data from an alien craft and make it publicly available. The data would be in a wildly strange format, but if it were deciphered, it could be an encyclopedic window to alien worlds.",
