    "name": "D' Amboise Gate",
    "description": " The edifice of this Gate featured number of sizeable halls destined for use as emplacements or mustering and development of the Guard. Niched above the arched entrance of the Gate, there appears an angel brandishing the coats of arms of the Order as well as those of the House of d’Amboise, along with an inscription reading “D’AMBOISE M. DXII (1512)”. Definitively of a more modern concept, this part of the fortification bears witness to the opulence and power of the Order.",
