Their identity almost hinges on their blue wigs and this series traces these women from childhood to adulthood- a 'blue-wigged sisterhood'.\n\nThe Uncanny Valley as an instinctive reaction has always been associated with technological advancement but can it also be applied to something more anachronistic as the hijab?",
