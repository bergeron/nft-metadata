    "description": "If you are in visiting London, or even if you are a local, you must take some time to go for a walk by in many of the Canals around London. It is a fantastic experience. This was taken on the Regent's Canal, by Kings Cross St. Pancreas, 2022.\n\nThese editions are here to celebrate my first ETH contract and the fact that I have been working full time as a photographer, for myself, for 9 months now.\n\nThank you all for helping my dreams come true.\n\nThere's an extra reward as well. \nThe holder of more editions by the closing time of this claim, will get one of my 1/1's from the B&W Minimalistic Collection.\n\nThank you all for your Love and Support in these 9 months.",
