    "description": "// Looking back collection captures people around the world that stop and take a look back.\n\n// Varadero is one of the most well-known tourist places in Cuba. The beauty of the coast line helps to forget the challenges that lie at the other side. While being on the beach, this couple of craft vendors lined the shore and decided to stop next to us; not with the aim of offering anything but simply get some rest and look back.\n\n// Location: Varadero  (Cuba)  \n// Date: 16 April 2005",
