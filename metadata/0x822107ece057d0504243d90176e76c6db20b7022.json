    "description": "Freedom is a state where one is not controlled by any external force. It is a quality that many people desire and it can be achieved through various means.\n\nWhat does true freedom look like? The answer to this question depends on the person and their situation. For some, it may be being able to do what they want without having to worry about consequences. For others, it may be being able to live in peace with themselves, their mind and body free from harm or pain.  \nTrue freedom is like a dance, just like water it flows without worries, the body, mind and soul must be revered in every way. The dance becomes spontaneous, unmanipulated and done in surrender.",
