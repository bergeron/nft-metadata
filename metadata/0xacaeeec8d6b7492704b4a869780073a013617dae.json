    "description": "1/1  \n68sec \nSOUND ON NOW\n\nmy first step into this new space is a collaborative one. \nHAL (produced by myself and @kolsch in December of 2017) has been reworked/stripped down to a new unreleased version codenamed PURE EMOTION, split into six parts, each of which was the basis for a new generative/photographic piece by @ivonatau \n\neach piece is 1/1. audio will never be released. and each piece played in sequence: 1-6 makes up the original arrangement. 1 (_feeling) 2 (_lift) 3 (_energy) 4 (_release) 5 (_peak) and 6 (_dawn) \n\ni fell in love with Ivonas work, and she knew my music (and liked it) so it was a great fit and a natural partnership. \n\nfeel/see/hear the sound/vision\n\nIvona Tau is a generative AI artist who works in the intersection of photography with new technologies and deep learning. Her goal is to find and evoke emotions in the artificially intelligent tools, this way making them more human.\n\nKolsch is an electronic musician and DJ and friend.\n\nI am, well, i'm the real me.
