    "description": "21 has been one of the best years of my life. after turning 22 last month and just now hitting 1 year of being in web3, it only makes sense for me to drop this version of the song NOW rather than later.\n\nin august 2021, i moved out of my house in the valley and into a studio apartment in Hollywood that i shared with my brother. rent was twice as expensive, and i was honestly scrambling to get by.\nin september, i turned 21 and was initially just feeling very scared of getting older. in october, my dear friend Bruno Neves came over one day and introduced me to web3. it took me a sec to really get it, but at some point, something clicked and i IMMEDIATELY dove into the space - ask anyone, i was everywhere haha\n\ni've made friends with people that will stick with me the rest of my life, traveled more than ever before, played venues i've always dreamed of playing, and honestly just made the best music of my life. this really is just the beginning. thank you everyone who has supported me this far. i know i say it often, but i fr can't wait to keep going. hope you dig this lil tune <3\n\nwritten by Peter Saputo & Tommy Allen\nproduced by Peter Saputo\nmixed by Peter Saputo\nmastered by ThÃ©o Quayle\n\ncover art / golden egg art - with no context, were shot during some of my favorite days of 21 <3",
