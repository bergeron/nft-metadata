    "description": "The Flower Portraits series explores Stéphane's relationship to the world around him. Through his portraits of flowers like so many self-portraits, the photographer seeks to understand himself. It can be recognized in small floral details, sometimes revealed by light, sometimes hidden in shadow or blur.\n\nStéphane also invites each spectator to question themselves and their relationship to the world. What we show to others. What we hide. What we know. What we don't know.\n\nIn his portraits, Stéphane focuses on one flower at a time, enveloped in a mysterious, almost mystical light. The particular atmosphere that runs through all the images gives the photographer a personal and recognisable style.",
