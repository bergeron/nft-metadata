    "description": "In the silence of a calm night in the desert. As we were gazing up and around to behold the vastness & magnificence of the night sky in the dunes, we knew we were lucky to be there. There was no wind. Not a single sound around. Except for our own breaths & heartbeats. Eric’s countdown was a whisper in the dark, but it was so calm he didn’t have to say anything anymore for us to be connected. We were there for hours, creating with our light beneath this river of stars that has been capturing the human imagination forever.",
