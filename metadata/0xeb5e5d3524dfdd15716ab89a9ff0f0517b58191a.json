    "description": "Digitally edited acrylic painting on wood panel \n\nBased on the boiling frog metaphor, the idea that if you were to put a frog in boiling water it would immediately jump out, but if you put it in warm water and slowly increase the temperature it gets comfortable, like its in a bath, and won't notice the change until it's too late, representing slow changes in our life that we come accustomed to and over time don't even realize. iâ€™m attracted to this idea because it reminds me to be present and honest with myself, instead of closing my eyes and ignoring my issues.  \n",
