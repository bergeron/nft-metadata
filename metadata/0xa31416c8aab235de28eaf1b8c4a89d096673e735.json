    "description": "Leaving Orcas Island on a cold, but sunny September day, I came across the opportunity to capture three scenes in one single frame. \n\nBehind me, reflected in the window's glass, a passenger was getting their morning stretch in. \n\nJust beyond the glass in front of me, there were empty seats in a seasonally-closed section of the ferry. \n\nLooking through that closed section were passengers on the other side of the ferry deck, framed in the windows.\n\nPlease enjoy, \"Transparent Reflections\".",
