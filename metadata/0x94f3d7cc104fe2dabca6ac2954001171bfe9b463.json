    "description": "Mother nature daughter /\nmakes her way in the big city with determination and a firm step. She advances with the courage of a giant, facing the problems and obstacles\n\n\"People do not decide their future, they decide their habits and their habits decide their future\" alexander\n\nWhen women act like women, they are accused of being inferior. When women act like human beings, they are accused of behaving like men.\n\nFor a long time the future was in the hands of men, and women were treated as a headless gender.\n\ncreators of creation, they are life, they are nature equal to men, our brains are equal\nSince the beginning of time, human beings have been fighting against nature, which they consider to be an enemy,\nbuild and build technology and house structures to be safe.\n \nNow it is different, now some seem to understand we thxs to nature and we must preserve it because our existence coexists and depends on it.\n\nFuture in NOW\n",
