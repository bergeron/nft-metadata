    "description": "Sleep Half of It is one of my favorite songs I’ve ever gotten to make because of how the production makes me feel. The way that the sounds delicately poke out at you from the beat under mine & Mick’s vocals always makes me smile when I listen back. Working with Mick on this track is really a dream come true for me as I’ve always been such a huge fan of his. From the moment I started making the beat for this song, I immediately heard his voice & flow over it and I knew that he was exactly what the song needed. I love the way our voices contrast each other and it was such a personal honor to be able to collaborate on a song with him.",
