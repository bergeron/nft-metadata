    "description": "OPEN MINT | January 2022 Limited Edition\n\nOne piece can be burned to redeem \"Go With The Flow\". \n\nSeventy-One Percent, that is the total percentage of Earth's surface that is covered by water. \n\n620,000 Kilometers (372,000 miles) of coastline bordering these huge bodies of water. Imagine the number of photos that have been taken there. \n\nBut every piece is unique, due to the ocean’s wavy transitions: from cold to warm, from light to dark, from shallow to deep. \n\nThat is what makes the ocean a form of art, an ever-evolving and fluctuating piece.",
