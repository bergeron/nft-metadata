    "description": "This work is one of my first 100% digital abstract artworks on the blockchain.\n\nThe starting point was an image produced with the help of AI which I then developed further using digitall collage, glitch effects and digital painting.\n\nAfter several iterations and vacillating between figuration and abstraction the final result is a highly textural, layered abstract composition of pure digital colour and shape which acts as a hommage to the American abstract expressionist painters of the 1950s which I am greatly inspired by.\n\nPNG format, 5000x3918px\n2021\nby Theo Chronis",
