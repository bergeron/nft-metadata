    "description": "\"Sometimes I cannot tell if I'm in the good way or not, maybe there's no separation between good and evil, I just might be confused, but everything seemed so different while I was sinking...\"\n\nAbout the perception we have when we're hurt, I think this is the real concept of \"heartbreaking\": The love feelings are only in our brain, the one that controls all our illusions and generates all the conflicts we have inside... And maybe you're in a swamp and you didn't know that until your feelings got hurt...  \nEscaping from our vices, the things that we're used to do, think and feel are very painful for us, and we use to think that we should stay, we think that our surroundings want us to stay, seems like they try to drag us down and sink us again...\n\nResolution: 4900 x 6860 px  \nThis drawing was done using mouse in Photoshop.",
