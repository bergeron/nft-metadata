I'm worn out, despairing, enraged, hateful, resentful, sad, want to weep, want to die, don't know where to go, face many challenges, lack money, can't love, have no family, never appreciated, never appreciated, never ever thought to exist. Is dying the greatest option so I may rest peacefully in hell?",
