With greed in their hearts they murdered and harvested these mythic creatures for their valuable resources. \n\nThe anguished spirits of the murdered dragons corrupted the eggs that they left behind. What hatched was no noble dragon, but an abomination.\n\nThis Dragon was originally part of the Abomination Dragon collection of 310 uniquely spooky NFTs. This is the purified form.
