    "description": "1 //  The Sea of Tranquility\n\nI share the first discovery in my 888 days of travel, interactions, love, hate, remorse, regret and exploration.\n\nThe thought behind pouring my emotions into this art was to understand perennial contentment in life. Which eventually took me to the ocean city of Goa, India. That is where I found the answer. \nThe answer was “Susegad”.\n\nSusegad is a concept associated with the culture of Goa, India. Derived from the Portuguese word “sossegado”, it is viewed as the relaxed, laid-back attitude towards life that is said to have existed historically in the former Portuguese territory. \n\nI view the lifestyle as a simple, quiet and a meaningful life. A life full of love for yourself that resonates to the environment around you.\n\nSome key introspective notes written during the making of this piece.\n\n“Choose simplicity over complexity, no matter how much complexity tempts you.\"\n\n//\n\nA signed copy by 888 will be sent to the holder of this NFT.
