    "description": "Not far from you is a traveling carnival. The lights of the night, the sounds of the barrel organ and the laughter of the children riding the carousel beckon you. Away from the thick of things is the tent of the fortuneteller. On another day you would have passed by, but today is different. An inexplicable desire to go inside the tent keeps you busy. Eventually your curiosity takes over.\nInside you are greeted by the Gypsy Queen. She spreads out the tarot cards in front of you and said:  \nDo you see what I see? Be careful to choose.\nBe careful what you wish for, cause it may come true. \n\n1/1 digital art by Eiri Tavri \n4000*4000px 300 dpi",
