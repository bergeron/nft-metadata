    "description": "About this NFT painting\n\n\" A quiet afternoon, can you feel it ?  The moment back then when you had no concerns, life was easier\".\n\nWhat would he think on his little cloud? \nIs he going back home to have some rest?\nIs he in love right now? \nDoes he ever went on vacation?\nWhere is his favorite place?\nThere was a moment in his life, where the constant need of fight was resting and his mind was full of dreams, full of peace. \nSurrounded by the calmness, a bit of nostalgic sets in, leaving a little seed deep inside his heart. That seed one day will bloom suddently, like a ravenous animal, dipping him with tremendous joyful sadness. That seed is Nostalgia, a painful happiness that brings him those moments, when he was young and full of ambitions and dreams...\nCan you relate? \nCan you feel Nostalgia?",
