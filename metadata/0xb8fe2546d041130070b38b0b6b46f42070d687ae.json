As one of the few nude beaches around the city this place is an iconic place for locals and visitors alike.\n\nMade in San Francisco - A photo documentary of San Francisco culture shaped by its unique districts. This project was shot over 2 years and over 100 rolls of film slowly showcasing the city and how the history changed and visually developed these areas.\n\nShot on\n\nMamiya 645e  \nCinestill 800t",
