Owner-winemaker Loïc Pasquet uses rare varieties native to the Graves region on un-grafted rootstock, that were used to make wine in the mid 19th Century before the scourge of phylloxera was destroyed vineyards in France and most of Europe. These rare vines were chosen through ‘selection massale‘ to produce rather exceptional wines example ‘pre-phylloxera’ Bordeaux.",
