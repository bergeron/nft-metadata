    "description": "In the beginning I was just a huge mix of ideas,  emotions, feelings, a mess! I went trough different stages of existence until I evolved, I became something. Something that you can see, unravel and appreciate. \n\nI wish that when you see me I will make you feel at least a portion of the passion, fun, sweat, happiness, struggles and pride my creators had during my evolutionary process.\n\nThis is my introduction but I'm here to stay.",
