    "description": "this piece holds a very special place in my heart. arguably the most personal + emotional music i've ever made. some who have listened to this have told me it feels like they are evoking core memories and watching their own lives.\n\ni've never shared this with anyone other than the person this piece is about, but the title comes from a poem from Shel Silverstein. this is how it goes:\n\n“She had blue skin,\nAnd so did he.\nHe kept it hid\nAnd so did she.\nThey searched for blue\nTheir whole life through,\nThen passed right by-\nAnd never knew.”\n\nthe way i see it is that two souls may cross paths for a second or even have the fortune of experiencing many moments together without really knowing how similar and kindred they really are. sometimes you really can't tell unless you give people a chance and enough time to open up. sometimes it takes a lot to realize what you're walking by or letting go of.\n\nthis track is my personal soundtrack to one blue skin encounter i had. i hope it brings you memories of your own. perhaps you've also had many \"almost encounters\" or short ones that could've been much more.\n\nmuch love.",
