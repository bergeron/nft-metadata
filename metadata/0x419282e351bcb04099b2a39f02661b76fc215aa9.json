    "description": "Nature is beautiful, but donâ€™t take her for granted.  She will sneak up on you and take you by surprise, she will claim anybody that is foolish enough to venture into her realm.\n\nNature and the emotions and feelings it generates within me are key to my creative process.  This artwork was made to remind people that when you are walking in areas of natural beauty, make sure you are prepared, you had suitable clothes, footwear and are not relying on a mobile phone to navigate.\n\nThis piece was created using a series of my own landscape photographs combined with stock images and blended together with textures.\n\n",
