    "description": "Virtuality is a spell of a long natural homeorhesis; what seems to be a limited, soulless and claustrophobic environment is just a genesis phase, response and adaptation of synthetic matter emerging from a stress state created by ourselves.\n\nCubicula represents a close flyby of the staminal blocks of this new emerging branch of development, showing the landscape of stems scattered and clumped together in complex inscrutable dimensional ambients.\n\nConcept, visuals and music: Daniel Oakfield",
