    "description": "In the Summer / Fall of last year, I toured with She Wants Revenge, playing 40 shows across the US. My set up on stage was a synthesizer, electric guitar, drum machine and vocal effect box. It was a challenge, to bring my songs to the live stage on my own, as most of the music I had recorded with other musicians. But when I saw the audience reaction to what I was doing live, I realized that this was more satisfying than anything I had done before. I love making electronic music and having the autonomy to play it all on my own. \n\nFor “baby I love you <3” I asked my girlfriend to say something into my phone. She said “baby I love you.” Without thinking too much, I imported this sound file into my computer and within a few hours I had the song that you hear now. I had been struggling previously to figure out how to include my love of techno / house and DJing into my music that was otherwise relatively acoustic. But the more time I put into my own production, with just my computer and a keyboard, the more confident I am about this new direction and the more excited I am to make more electronic music.\n\nUltimately, this song isn’t tryna do too much. It’s just fun and feels good. I hope you love it.\n",
