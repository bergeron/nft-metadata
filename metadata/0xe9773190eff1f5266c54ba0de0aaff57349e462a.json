    "description": "Edition 1/3 (+ 1 AP)\n\nStinger draws upon video-game alchemy and the activating properties of nature and botanics, sculpting flowers in VR before animating them in Blender to grant them an otherworldly and spellbinding sense of movement. As a reference to dance and performance, the animations were developed as a choreography, with each flower portrayed as a body plunging through space, reaching, creeping, and lunging towards each other. \n\nOriginal audio by Ben Dixon.\n",
