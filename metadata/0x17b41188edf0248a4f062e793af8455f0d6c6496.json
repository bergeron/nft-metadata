    "description": "HECATE was the goddess of magic, witchcraft, the night, moon, ghosts, and necromancy. She was a deity of the lower world, a mighty and formidable divinity, ruling over the souls of the departed. She was the goddess of purifications and expiations, who at night sent from the lower world all kinds of demons and terrible phantoms, who taught sorcery and witchcraft, who dwelt at places where two roads crossed each other, on tombs, and near the blood of murdered persons. She herself too wandered about with the souls of the dead, and her approach was announced by the whining and howling of dogs.",
