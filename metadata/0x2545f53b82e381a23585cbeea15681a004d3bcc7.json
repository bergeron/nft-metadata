    "description": "Leonardo da Vinci - Mona Lisa\nOriginal animated artwork by THURB \n\n-----------\n\nThe project is a tribute that connects art history with the NFTs.\nThe time when artists sold their unique paintings in galleries with a certificate of authenticity. (which I think is kind of the same principle with NFTs today)\nI represented paintings known to all but in my style and animated (such as the Mona Lisa, The Scream, The Son of Man)",
