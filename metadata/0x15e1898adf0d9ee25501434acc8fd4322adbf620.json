    "description": "Towards A Man, is an attempt of studying what is the pictorial representation of a man nowadays.  \nPlaying with the clich√©s of the patriarchal society of the macho and adopting the hypersexualisation of how a woman is depicted throught the pictorial history and it's role to play. \nThis brings about questioning what it means to be a man, what it means to have a body as a factual state.",
