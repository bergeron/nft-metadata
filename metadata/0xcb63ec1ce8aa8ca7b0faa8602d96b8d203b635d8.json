    "description": "Tasty Bones is an NFT collection of 5000 skeletons who fetch food offerings from the Land of the Living and deliver to their respective Souls in the Land of the Dead. Tasty Bones have to contend with Hungry Ghosts‚Å§ and Demons who try to steal the food offering. The Demons are of varying shapes, sizes, and power levels (sounds rare!).\n\nTasty Bones is providing a community-driven interactive NFT experience that will tie into the lore! Holders will be able to interact with their NFT to increase their rarity and gain value through other mechanisms, but will run the risk of losing it if they get too greedy.",
