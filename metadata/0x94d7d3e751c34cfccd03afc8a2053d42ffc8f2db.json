    "description": "It completes a year, a daily art project, starting and finishing the arts in one day, aims to make my personal and spiritual development through art, it was amazing days, days and days, and with that life is this instability, sometimes we will be fine and sometimes we will be bad, at the center of this art, I connected a very strong connection that marked my life... The end of an abusive relationship. The project continues on instagram @monqueerart where you follow, art, poetry, knowledge and mismatches too, welcome to my world. Pleasure MonQueer turns one year old, he's a big baby, and it's a pleasure to take care of him.\n\nDian Vich \n2022",
