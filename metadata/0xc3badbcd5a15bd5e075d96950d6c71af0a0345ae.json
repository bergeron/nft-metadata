    "description": "Why does Art matter?\nWhat IS Art?\nWhy do we seek it, make it, need it?\n\nThese are questions I'm very much in the process of asking right now. In an impromptu inspiration, I made these graphics on canva ~ some with more personalization, some with less. I wanted to express my contemplation using both words and imagery.\n\nI explore answers to these questions on the green piece. Do you have any answers to add to that list?\n\nThis is my first mint of 2023 :3 Also my first time playing with the \"drops\" feature here on Zora. The experiment continues !!\n\nxx \nForrest",
