    "description": "Like the cosmos above us, the ocean is an unknown and full of mysteries force, capable of swallowing us and bringing unexpected answers and gifts that we didnâ€™t even know we needed. When the hand of fate takes the form of a wave, real magic happens.\n\nAnna-Maria is a 26 year old digital artist from Crimea, currently based in Armenia, with a romantic take on surrealistic, psychedelic art."
