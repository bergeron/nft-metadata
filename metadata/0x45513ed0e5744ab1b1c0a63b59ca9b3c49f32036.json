    "description": "ARITA means \"sharp\" in aymara, a lost indigenous language that was once spoken in the region.  \"Cono de Arita\" is the name given to this 200m pyramid that rests alone on top of an infinite white blanket made of salt. It is located in the Arizaro salt flat, the largest in Argentina and fifth in the world.\n\nIt is a true gift of nature, and there are many more unique landscapes in Argentina! We want it to be an open invitation for everyone who wants to visit the wonderful southern corner of the world.\n\nDuring the pandemic and given the travel restrictions in many countries, we took the opportunity to explore more deeply our beloved country, despite the socio-economic difficulties it is going through, and we could not be more grateful and proud of it.",
