    "description": "She was a robot. Born in Axana world, she was lost and forgotten. She was finding her way, listening to the unfamiliar sound of a heartbeat. And saw colored worlds in her meta-dreams. She came to life one January evening as soon as Elena Rightâ€™s hand touched her face. It was ZERO DAY. Now she exists in two worlds. Now she will live forever.\n\nAXANA & ELENA RIGHT . 2023.",
