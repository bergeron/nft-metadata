    "description": "It's sunrise and you're on a long bus ride to nowhere.  \nAnd I mean so early that you're one of the very few people who are even awake at this hour, not to mention taking this bus that goes far from the busy city life.  \nIt's your alone time with your bag full of books of poetry and drawing supplies. You know that you have to be back before dawn or fear will set in so you take in the morning and take a deep breath.",
