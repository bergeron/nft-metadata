    "description": "Timeless Spaces mixes poetics, illusion, and common images to localize some of our most abstract self-concepts. With these pieces, reduced to color and sound, we studied the sites of our intimate lives. In the theater of the past that is constituted by memory, a home is our primary image - a microspace within an image: corners, nests, drawers, cupboards, cellars, and attics all become a figure in this analysis of time.\n\nMusic by Michael Askill.\n\n2 minute loop, (2000 x 2000 px)\n\nThe owner will receive a high-res file.",
