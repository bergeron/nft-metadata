    "name": "THE 6TH ENTRANCE TO HELL",
    "description": "Dear Death,\n\nYour passengers wait patiently for the opportunity to salute the fears which have nourished their souls.\nSitting in silence, inches from each other’s backs, imagining what burdens they may have carried.\n\nOur whispers are dry, inhibiting the humid stench of self-deprecation. \n\nTapping my shoulder is a waste of time. What does one say when hope feels like an impossibility? \n\nSpeaking from the past feels like a sin of the future and the only solitude I can afford is the memories of immortal optimism.\n\nThis is the failed promise of eternal comfort, even in one’s childish pain. \n\nFor here I wait, your forgotten friend and ancestral enemy, Peppa Pig.",
