    "description": "This piece was made with an old picture of my father, that I took somewhere (we were lost) in 2019. It was a very nice day, the way he was looking through the horizon and how calm everywhing was is the best memorie I have with him.\n\nOn September 3rd, Tjo released his iconic BLeU as CC0. I tried to make a lot of derivatives, but I really loved how his BLeU fits with this picture and the way it felt personal to me.",
