    "description": "BROKEN HOPE - FREE MINT ( only 500 editions) \n\nThis is the last photo from my broken lens (Tamron 15-30). So this one belongs to the community \nAnd people who stood for me in the moment of need. \n\nWHY FREE ? Let me tell you a story of “BROKEN HOPE” \n\nOn sep 26 on Iceland tour I broke my main \nWide angle lens and main one, I was sad and devastated\n\nSo, I looked for the help in ICELAND and I tweeted about this incident and within a seconds people came into DMs and RT/QT and whole community stood for me to help me in that remote land.So this broken hope got the new hope from the community and people who not just helped me but encouraged me to move on and live the rest of the trip and don’t affect your mental health or photography due to this..  \n",
