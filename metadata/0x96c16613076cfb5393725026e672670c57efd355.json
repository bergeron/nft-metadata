    "description": "Laser installation art created in LaserLewDude's closet using lasers, glass and mirrors.  \nGlass sculpture (Being) made by p0ng aka @r0bp  \nGIF created from raw video. \n\nNot a render.\n\nSetup Details: \n2x 1W Laser Cubes hung from above the camera, bouncing off 1st surface mirrors suspended above the centerpiece downward to a mirror placed behind centerpiece, and finally back towards camera at an upward angle (gold beams). \n\nThere are 2 1st surface mirrors BEHIND to the immediate L+R of the being that are being used \"passively\" (no beams hitting them directly). \n\nThe 2 1st surface mirrors converging around the being's head are glued to crystal pillars. 2 50mm glass balls...sitting there. \n\n1st surface mirrors salvaged from rear projection TVs.",
