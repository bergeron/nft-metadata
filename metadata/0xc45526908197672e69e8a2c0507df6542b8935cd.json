    "description": "Freedom arises between pain and liberation in the soul and body, and human experiences it every day. This pain and confrontation between soul and body are present in all humans and this, in a world where suffering and war are mixed with love and peace, leads most people to this confrontation. \nThese images are my encounter as a photographer with actors who, in fact, each of them, as a human being, shows their inner self \nin moments of the performance, and I, as a photographer with long exposure photography of that moment, show the human confrontation with themself in a picture. While the actors \npretend to be aware of them, they can not see these images.\n\nThis is a portion of the collection that continues. ",
