    "description": "The world's first NFT was minted by Kevin McCoy on Namecoin in 2014. It's called “Quantum,” and was sold in 2021 via Sotheby's for $1.47 million.  \nThe human being has a characteristic that distinguishes him since his appearance on planet earth. We are explorers. We explore and create, then we explore and build. Without this exploratory drive we would not be here today. With this project I wanted to close a trilogy started with pioneers and builders. The story of the explorers got complicated while I was creating it, I realized that what I was creating was more and more like a time travel. Travel to the future to discover the past.\n\nFor purchases over 0.5 ETH, a 40x40 cm print will be sent",
