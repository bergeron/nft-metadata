    "description": "This was taken in Delhi, while we were walking through the streets near Jama Masjid. I went to see this child. He was whispering to his siblings and eating theÂ piece of rotti given by his mother. The thing that locked my eyes was that some flies were flying near his eyes, and I thought they were chattering about an empty stomach. On the other hand, overcoming an empty stomach is not a gesture of charity. If we make the world better for kids, we make it better for everyone\n\n\nArtist - Arjun ak\nLocation - Delhi, India\nYear - 2022\nDimensions: 1440 x  1800\nEdition: 1/1\nLicense: As long as the creator is credited, the primary NFT holder can use the NFT in advertising, to display privately and in groups, and to create virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays.
