    "description": "Insecurities, they haunt our minds\nA whisper in the dark, a voice that binds\nTelling us we're not enough, not worthy of love\nFilling us with doubt, a poison that's tough to shove\n\nWe compare ourselves to others, their lives seem so grand\nOur own accomplishments, we fail to understand\nWe worry about our flaws, our imperfections\nAs if they define us, our greatest afflictions\n\nWe fear rejection, the sting of disapproval\nSo we hide our true selves, in constant removal\nOf the parts of us that we deem as unworthy\nHoping that someday we'll be deserving of mercy\n\nBut insecurities, they never truly fade\nNo matter how hard we try, they never evade\nSo we must learn to accept them, to face them head-on\nTo love ourselves despite them, until they're gone\n\nFor in our insecurities lies a truth\nThat we are all flawed, in our own unique hue\nAnd it's these imperfections that make us real\nA beautiful mosaic, that time cannot steal.\n",
