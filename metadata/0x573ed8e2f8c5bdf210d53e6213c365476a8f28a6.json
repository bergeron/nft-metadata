    "description": "I've been looking for myself my whole life, trying to find the light without knowing the darkness, struggling to find happiness without accepting my sorrows. \n\nBut I finally found out that my truest self has deep roots in my darkest blue moments. I finally accepted my beautiful sorrows. I made friends with those little monsters that had been always inside me. I feared them for a long time. \n\nBut suddenly they were not scary anymore. They were just lovable sad monsters, who were born in my loneliest moments. Now they were precious to me. I made friends with them. And I gave them love. \n\nAnd that was how I finally found happiness.",
