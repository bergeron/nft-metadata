    "description": "This collection of 1/1 archive photographs of New York is a visual celebration of my 20+ years lived in this city: Its multitudes, its extraordinary scenes, and its staggering architecture, as well as a quiet elegy to its decay and rebirth.\n\nThis collection strives to be a token of sincere gratitude from the eyes of a Turkish immigrant, whose youth revolved around a deep fascination with American pop culture in the 1980s and 1990s, and a longing to belong to this city of neon and chrome.\n\nArtist: Engin Beri\nCollection: City of Neon and Chrome\nLocation: New York, NY / USA\nDate: 2014\nDimensions: 3000px x 3750px\nEdition: 1/1â€¨\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
