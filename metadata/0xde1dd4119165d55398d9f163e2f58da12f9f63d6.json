    "description": "With the advent of autonomous AI operations on the corpus of data in existence for all humans (AGIOps), can we as humans evolve in symbiosis?\n\nAbout 10 years ago, Berndnaut Smilde, despite making these amazing physical clouds inside of buildings, said, \"I cannot really control the cloud.\" So, I thought this was poetic in referencing not only his reference to physical clouds, but the cloud as in data and cloud computing, in which we, now, do have control of the cloud through AI for IT operations, which we are calling AIOps. Smildeâ€™s statement of, not having control of the cloud, I think is also playing a longer game, and with the cloud, forecasting a cultural climatic shift with the advent of autonomous decentralized AI.",
