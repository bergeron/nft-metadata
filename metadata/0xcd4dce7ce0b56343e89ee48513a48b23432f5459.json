    "description": "From mystery we arrive, to mystery we return. The door to that mystery now, is love.  \n\n\"I can feel the songs from the depths, where the sea has become sand, the ebony shores of my dream. My wings are tired so I must rest. Grandfather Owl appears from the dark sky and offers a healing potion to awaken my spirit and calm my nerves, as I surrender to the silver blue spiral light emanating from my heart.\"\n\nKohaji (Music by Woven Talon)\n\nPhotograph taken at Whatipu Beach in New Zealand.",
