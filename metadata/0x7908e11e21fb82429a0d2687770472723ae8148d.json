    "description": "What if you could buy music as art? WAVEFORM is a 1/1 song initially produced by 3LAU that grants 100% of its rights to its owner. The owner of WAVEFORM is granted full master recording & publishing rights, and is thus entitled to reproduce, commercialize, edit, remix, rename & release WAVEFORM or any derivative version of the beat’s original form. All stems of WAVEFORM will be provided to its owner, as well as the complete project file containing all of the song’s sound design inputs. Inspired by Wu Tang Clan’s  “Once Upon A time In Shaolin” auction that granted exclusive listening access to a single individual, WAVEFORM extends the meaning of scarcity in music; it’s a song that can be listened to by everyone, but only truly owned & controlled by one. The initial auction winner will receive an accompanying physical piece, the WAVEFORM sound sculpture:  https://bit.ly/wfsculpture\n\nLegal Agreement:   https://bit.ly/wflegal",
