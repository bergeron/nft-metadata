    "description": "“Splinters” is an interactive 3D piece using glitch—both the technique and its aesthetic—to explore the limits of the human form. I use glitch processing to fragment, transform and reassemble the body to evoke a range of emotions, including feelings of rapture. The glitch process renders the body erratic, unfamiliar and open for rediscovery.\n\nThe piece was created using a script that converts a 3D model's mesh geometry into RAW data. That data was then put through the audio-editing program Audacity and effects like \"reverb\" and \"amplify\" were applied to the data. The file was then recoded back into a 3D format and layered on top of the original fragmented model.",
