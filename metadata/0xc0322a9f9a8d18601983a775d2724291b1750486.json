    "description": "Deep in a distant forest, hidden between the rune-carved trees lies the peaceful town of Bellever. A bastion of elven treasure-seekers protected and hidden by magic.\n\nIt is here that the girl Suki was born and raised. Guided by the village elders, she cultivated her magical talent to summon any item from her home by consuming magical Ethereum; a mere parlor trick for some, but a powerful skill for those that spend their lives collecting ancient and rare artifacts.\n\nAlways an explorer, her romps into the forest have stoked a burning wanderlust. Now the imaginary worlds she dreams up no longer sate her adventurous appetite as she prepares to take on the world.\n\nSuki, like all who come of age in Bellever, sets out to seek lost treasures to add to the power and knowledge of the Bellever clan. She'll need every tool, potion, and keepsake in her attic to take on the task ahead.\n\nIt’s time for her to embark on her journey towards the first source of magic: an abandoned manor in the deep woods. Compass in hand she takes the northern road, and by her side, Mitz, the Cat follows.",
