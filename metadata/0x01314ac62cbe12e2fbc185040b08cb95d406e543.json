    "description": "Eggs survey the wreckage.\n \nThis is the last painting in a series depicting the journey of anthropomorphized sperm as they go on a pilgrimâ€™s progress through a mercurial Uteroverse. The series charts the creation and destruction of relationships between sibling-sperm in a world where the landscape outwits the voyager. \n\nYou can explore the whole series in VR here: \nhttps://uteroverse.world/\n\nThis work was inspired by my recent discovery of a brother, from my dad's sperm donation, identical to me in age, based three miles away and also living on soylent. Discovering this, I felt a rush of warmth towards humanity, and all the potential siblings it held. Later I started thinking about all the versions of myself, of anyone, who got ovulated out a few days early, or ejaculated into a tissue, or a sock. A tablespoon of semen contains 200 million sperm; it's statistically impossible that, genetically, we are the best versions of ourselves. What amazing luck to be here at all.",
