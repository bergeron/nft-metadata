    "description": "This pieces is Award Winning International Art Competition of Arte Laguna 2021/2022 which the exhibition will be happening in 2023.\n\nI Can't See My House is a collective that captures rice farming activity and the surrounding landscape in alienation feelings and emotions in between. \n\nThese pictures are taken during in the lockdown 2020 in my rural village of (Batang Buo) Indonesia where I originated. It presents the contrast of mental state, the inability to see things clearly, segmented and physiological destruction between what we see now in the picture and the actual feeling back in the day were sunny in a tropical country. \n\nThe hyperreality connection between the image and the graphic also describes how much we are associated with technology these days. \n\nhttps://artelaguna.world/artist/saputra-eko/",
