    "description": "The details in the little things are sometimes the most splendid. Metamorphosis is a micro-texture from a larger painting which drew inspiration from the wings of a butterfly. I've always been intrigued by their color combinations, textures, and iridescence - each unique amongst over 17,500 species. \n\nThis NFT comes paired with a 12x12\" Framed Archival Print, signed and numbered 1/1.
