    "description": "Hailing from Sky, Doctor Whale is a calm Chubbifren. They always wear their candy blue as a special symbol for their hero, Magical Turtle. Ever since Doctor Whale was first adopted, they've had a rare and powerful ability to eat food. Maybe one day it'll help them finally achieve their lifelong dream of travelling the world. If you see them around the stable, say hi! But whatever you do—don't be sad — they can't stand it.",
