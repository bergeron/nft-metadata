    "description": "Curated by Paris Hilton and was a part of \"Empowered by Paris\" Collection\n\nScandinavian society has championed gender equality since before the Viking era. Their history and mythology are filled with powerful female warriors, Valkyries being the ones of most empowering female figures in history. She-warriors who marched alongside the men to fight in some of the biggest battles in Viking history, holding the power to choose which warriors lived and died in battle. Their bravery is legendary. \n\nGeiravör, the \"spear goddess\", a glorious Valkyrie, riding her steed with regal posture. She's unsullied, even on the dusty battlefield, not a single speck of dust has touched her. She is beauty, she is grace, calm and collected, knowing exactly her might. She represents all those goddesses who stand tall and fight any injustice in the name of all women all over the globe. Those amazons who stay strong, inspire others not to give up and do everything in their power to end cultural misogyny.\n\n",
