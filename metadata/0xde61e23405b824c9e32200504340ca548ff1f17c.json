    "description": "Dark Surreal Art - The Wonderland of Nightmares:\n\n'Nightmares & Hallucinations' project aims to illustrate and share bizarre dreams. Indeed, the main nature of this project and uncanny styles of its items is simply much more than mere horror art. It is a kind of conceptual art for taking its own audience in places of unconscious. It is like an anti-rational response to a world that allowed a horrific disregard for humanity. The style embraces chaos, unconscious desires, and the theory of psychoanalysis. The adoption of these principles would help in discovering the true world â€“ through the unconscious mind and interpretation of dreams.",
