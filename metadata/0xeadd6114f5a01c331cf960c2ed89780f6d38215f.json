    "name": "Blossoms her Beauty",
    "description": "Blossoms her real beauty, as she accepts herself in the mirror of imperfection, knowing her perfect self. She started growing from the time when she knew her body is an art created by the universe, unique and perfect. \n\nMany times she too struggled to accept the creation of her self being. Trying ways to alter, without even understanding the true beauty of her creation. She never let herself free, free enough to let her skin shine, free enough to let the skin curve and free enough to admire the beauty of her face. \n\nSo, it's time to let go and be free, to celebrate your beauty in its raw form without moulding it in the structure of society.
