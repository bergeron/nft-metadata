    "description": "Violence, Peaceful, Glad, Jealousy, Fear, Pure, and Gloom. All of these feelings have been circling in my mind for years. I went through a great fall in my life which mixed all these colors/emotions in my mind causing emotions to come out of nowhere and sometimes I had to hide them. But im still here fixing my mind so I could be myself again",
