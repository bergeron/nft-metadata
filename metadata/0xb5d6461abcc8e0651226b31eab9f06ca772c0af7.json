    "description": "I would like to introduce you the Çarıklı hamlet, located in the Sultan Reedy National Park area of the town of Sindelhöyük, Kayseri and the Çobanoğlu family living here and Kardelen, their youngest child of 6 children. Kardelen lives in one of these houses, right at the end of this tiny civilization. She opens her door and what she can see beyond it is a vast field of reeds.This work runs every day, regardless of the weather conditions. In these difficult conditions, Kardelen is struggling to get an education. She could not attend school due to the impossibilities experienced. As a result of some initiatives, Kardelen was placed in a charity foundation established for girls to study. Now her lessons are very good there and she enjoys joining her classes and discovering a new world of knowledge.I will be very happy to see her having a good job in future.She is exactly like a flower that blooms in the snow.As a token of my gratitude, 50% of the income from this NFT will be donated.",
