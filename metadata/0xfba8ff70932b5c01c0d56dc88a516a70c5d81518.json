    "description": "This composite shot was taken on Yiruk/Wamoon country, in Victoria Australia. Usually known as Wilson's Promontory, the national park resides on the joint country of Yiruk & Wamoon indigenous Australians. \n\nI had returned to Australia after two and a half years living overseas during the pandemic. Spending time in nature and reconnecting to the land I missed so much was a healing process for me. It helped me to reflect on my personal depression and trauma of being locked out of my homeland for so long.\n\nThe Big Drift is a large barren sand deposit, surrounded by coastal brush and wildlife. When you enter the dunes, it feels like you have found another world. A feeling of solitude in a vast landscape; I couldn't help but make a connection with how I had felt the years prior. This shot to me symbolises this solitude I felt. A lone tree, with the moon forever guiding you no matter where you are in the world.",
