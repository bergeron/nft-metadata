    "description": "-Initial Purchase of this NFT Includes a signed / numbered 24 x 36 print-\n\nYou cannot appeal to the humanity of anyone who doesn't already see you as human.\n\nWhen I was young, I was attacked, beaten to blood, repeatedly called a nigger, and thrown into a police car. They did donuts in an empty parking lot, slamming my head against the glass as they rapidly changed directions while reciting how many years I would spend in prison for whatever charges they could creatively pin on me. They then tossed me into a cell with at least a dozen other people who looked just like me while guards threw bleach at us. I still remember the smell and how my eyes burned along with every open cut and gash on my skin.\n\nThe heat on my skin reminded me of that night as I moved closer to the flames. I remembered every punch and kick with each click of my shutter. I wanted them to burn like my skin still does, every night in my nightmares. \n\nWe're done asking to be seen as human. ",
