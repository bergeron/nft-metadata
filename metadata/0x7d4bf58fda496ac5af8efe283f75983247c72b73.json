    "description": "1/1 NFT\n\nThis was captured along a hike in Leura, one of the most beautiful parts of the Blue Mountains in NSW, Australia. \n\n  I remember this day like it was yesterday. It was the start of Autumn, it had been raining for consecutive days. As I began this hike, I entered the forest and straight away I was hit with a moody scene that was truly magical, It honestly felt like I had been teleported into a fairytale. \n\nIt was my ambition to capture this scene exactly how I saw it. Lush green plants, sloshed tracks leading up to the thick fog in the distance, all whilst the Leura Cascades was flowing violently beside me. Crazy to think that this was just the start of what’s to come. \n\nThe winning bid will receive a signed 16” x 20” fine print of this NFT. ",
