    "description": "With the advent and dramatic improvement in AI, am I really an Artist any longer? \n\nWhat does it mean for my B.F.A. degree from Art School and the decades I’ve put into my studio practice? \n\nWhat do/will my friends, family, and collectors (of my physical paintings) think about my AI work that allows me (and others) to create almost anything we can imagine…without formal training or years of hard work? \n\nThere exists a bit of existential angst I’m feeling as my studio practice competes with the gravitational force and pull of my digital/AI work.\n\n6000px x 4000px PNG\n@LimnDigital",
