That's why its name is \"The Original\".\n\nEmo Eyes are Hand Generated Animations.\nEach piece has a Unique Design and Animation.\n\nFor any creature, eyes are the main assets showing deep Emotions, Charisma and sometimes by just looking into the Eyes you can feel the whole Story they want to tell.\n\nEmo Eyes are small pieces of Animations each trying to tell that Story.",
