    "description": "Mongolian horses are a unique breed that has remained unchanged since the reign of Genghis Khan in the 13th century.\nThey call horses Takhi. Takhi means spirit. They believe they can run as fast as the spirit.\nA Mongol without horse is like an eagle without wings, so they say.\nIt was very exciting to watch and photograph them running like the wind in the vast steppe of Mongolia.\n\n",
