    "description": "Seraphim followed the map through the winding paths of the new world, determined to complete the task that the mature creatures had given her. She trekked through dense forests, crossed raging rivers, and climbed steep mountains, facing all manner of obstacles along the way. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of travel, she arrived at the foot of a towering mountain, where she saw the entrance to an ancient temple carved into the rock face. The temple was massive, with columns and archways stretching up to the sky, and carvings of strange beasts and symbols adorning the walls.",
