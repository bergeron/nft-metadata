    "description": "The term \"ultrasonic\" refers to sound waves that are above the range of human hearing. By naming my collage \"Ultrasonic Wave,\" I suggest that the human body is like a vibration, something that emits sound waves beyond what we can hear. Our bodies are connected to the larger vibrations of the universe, and we are all part of a larger cosmic harmony."
