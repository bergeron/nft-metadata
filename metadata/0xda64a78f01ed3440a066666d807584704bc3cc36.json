    "description": "This mysterious, lifeless forest was once fairy and green. Elves lived in it. Thousands of elves and animals lost their home after an attack by dark forces. The forest was left in desolation. Those who did not flee from the forest and chose to continue protecting it changed themselves. \nThey are like this forest, transformed into a pale shadow of their past selves.  \nMy name is Miriel, and I led this company, trying to help them keep what remains of the majesty this magical forest has left. I am trying to find a way to remove the dark spells and return home to all the Elves forced to become nomads. \nI hope I'll be able to do that. Next time I'll introduce you to the rest of the magical forest. You will come back to help us, right? \nWell, and maybe I'd like to meet you again...",
