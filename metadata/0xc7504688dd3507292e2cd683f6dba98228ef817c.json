    "description": "Way of nature is a visual art which is a voxel diorama which has two parts\n1. A modern city and 2. A abandoned city\nThe artwork has a big magical boulder/ asteroid which has a small sand clock\nWhich has the power to revert/alter the time and space, The clock made the city\n to change into a new Vista as you see how the city might look after a 100 years, \nAs the nature has the power to conquer the world, The nature's way is unmatchable\n\nThe concept and art took me more than 5 weeks to complete with work of hours\ndaily approx and the turntable animation took around 3 days, seriously thought\n my laptop might explode or something ,\nThe inspiration was from alice in borderland poster but the actual idea to do something\nLike this I got a dream about it and I seriously wanted to do it and I did\nAlso I have used references of the last of us game and searched tons of abandoned photos\n\nFinally I wanted to portray that the power of nature and we should protect it ",
