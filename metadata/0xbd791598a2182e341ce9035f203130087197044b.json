    "description": "The creation of this piece was motivated by a sudden death (by his own hand) of a dear friend, who never ever showed any signs of such strong soul pain that would lead him to take his own life.\n\nIn this picture, we can see a beautiful woman whose whole appearance and especially her eyes show us her pain, and her damaged and tormented soul.\nBy multiplying and slightly displacing it (by moving only 40px each step up and down) I tried to show that we all are more than just what meets the eye, we are complex and multi-layer beings who, too often hide our true nature and our pain.\n\n\nNFT properties: \n1200 x 2000 px I 300dpi I png I 24 bit RGB\nby @Uzzy - Nov 2022\n",
