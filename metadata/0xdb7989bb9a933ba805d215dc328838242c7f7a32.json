    "description": "Ev.A Black\n\nGenesis (Adam and Eve, Black)\n.\nIn all books and literature, where Adam and Eve are portrayed and described, they are white beings, why?\nIf not even the story we are told can be proved, why do we learn that the great representatives of human existence are white?\n\nThis is a different perspective that I believe is important to reflect and consider.\n\nEve comes first, and Adam comes later, let's also make an inversion of the conventional title and value the role of women in the story.\n\nEdition: 1/1\n.\nThis NFT refers exclusively to the digital edition, printing of this work is not allowed without the author's permission.\nIf the first collector wants a hard copy, he can contact me to verify the possibility.\n.\n.\nDATA SHEET\n5000 x 3333  px, 300dpi",
