    "description": "Back for their second collaborative drop, Ollie Chanin and Negative Vibrations have created a full length animated music video for ‘Submarine In The Desert’. The song, which tells the story of a psychedelic journey through the desert in Joshua Tree, is brought to life by the surreal imaginings of Negative Vibrations animation. \nEach open edition consists of highlighted scenes from the full video, and each edition counts as one entry in a raffle for the the 1/1.",
