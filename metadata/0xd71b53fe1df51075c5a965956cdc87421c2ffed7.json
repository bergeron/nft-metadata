This was hugely inspiring to the designers, who set out to create a jacket that only exists in their imagination. Inspired by one of Venice’s most spectacular sites, The Mosaic Impossible Jacket is a stunning piece of digital wearable art.\n\n[View on UNXD](https://unxd.com/drops/collezione-genesi/the-velvet-impossible-jacket)",

This 9-piece, one-of-a-kind collection was personally designed by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana exclusively for UNXD. It features entirely hand-made, museum-grade items across Alta Moda (women), Alta Sartoria (men), and Alta Gioielleria (high jewelry). In a historic moment for the NFT ecosystem, Collezione Genesi is the first luxury NFT collection that involves both digital and physical works, truly bridging the physical and the metaphysical.",
