    "description": "TOOLS OF THE TRADE is a collection of work by 1980kâ€”a representation of the creative techniques used in his daily craft.  \n\nAscii art is mixed with light diffusion so that objects beyond are liquified. A representation of my daily tools such as Cursor, Pen, and Type inside computer windows.\n\nI created the original Cursor, Pen, and Type tools with neon glass and converted the image to ascii art before placing it into the visual.\n\nArtwork by 1980k \n1/1",
