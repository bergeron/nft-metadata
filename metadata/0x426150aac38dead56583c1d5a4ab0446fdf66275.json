    "description": "Tapping into a shared history of computer games and digital environments, Zyva Studio & Sam Buckley created this chair from the 35 distinct variants of a hexomino (a solid shape with 6 segments, much like a Tetris shapesâ€™ 4 segments). Through combining and recombining these shapes the project sought to find forms that speak the language of furniture and interior design but in a dialect that is true to the thinking of both design studios, through both color and structure. Choosing the most ubiquitous furniture form, the humble chair, as the starting point for a physical manifestation of the concept drives the narrative of simplicity of choice as the collection pieces were assembled both digitally and physically.\nSound design: Antoine Cerbere",
