    "description": "When determining the most effective soldiers for combat operations, there comes a fine balance between skill, professionalism, and team tactics. On a rare occasion, however, there comes individuals who don’t meet any of those criteria, and instead make up for it with a righteous fury and ruthless brutality. Talis would fall into this category.\nAfter being rejected by several military units for a lack of “team synergy” and “ability to follow orders,” Talis found herself completely in her element with this new Zombie horde beginning to take over. Bordering on completely psychotic, Talis was observed by Sevora in the middle of a zombie attack, maniacally laughing and savagely swinging two swords around her, like some sort of drunken dance, with zombie pieces and blood being strewn all around in her wake. The sheer savagery and genuine pleasure she seemed to get from dismembering zombies, while unconventional, proved to be a great way to get the attention of the world’s most elite task force. She now works on the front lines of any Vortex operation with Sevora, typically acting as the distraction for the team to infiltrate and gain strategic advantage.",
