    "description": "Las Vegas Boulevard, otherwise known as The Strip, is the main thoroughfare through Las Vegas. The Strip starts at the south end with Mandalay Bay and ends at the north end with The Stratosphere. Mid-strip, you'll find Paris Las Vegas which is pictured here. There are so many cars on the strip I knew I wanted to show the movement of the city with a long exposure of light trails. This is harder than you think in Vegas because there are so many people on the sidewalks that it's difficult to get a spot to put down a tripod.",
