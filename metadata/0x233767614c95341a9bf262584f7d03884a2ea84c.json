    "description": "Synthetic Desires is an exploration of the human body providing a canvas for these creatures to thrive. This piece captures our dual desire to be repulsive and to be desired. We want to decay but we want to be idealized. The tension between the human form and transcended ideas, and the relationship with death.\n These creatures are decaying; as nature is, and has always been, beautiful and grotesque. The artistic process is a negotiation between opposing forces of attraction and repulsion, of how we want to see ourselves and how others want to see us. AI and painting have been used to achieve an intense response.",
