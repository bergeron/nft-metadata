    "description": "Prism, 2022, stop motion animation. \n\nHow do you measure the space between Selves? \nThis stop motion animation, from Cc & Juni, assembles our two figures in daytime afterglow — through a prism of skin and sky and parts diffusing. Glitching in and out of frame, they fracture and recombine. CC’s identity as a nonbinary femme embraces Juni’s trans femininity in a caress of contrast. Their conjoined forms stand tall, cut out from the void, in the halo of a backdrop both unreal, and surreal — effervescent, technicolor, vaporized. Where does the spirit really congeal?\n\n“Prism” is a statement of queerness, identity, and singularity; of everything and nothing.\n\nMedium: stop motion animation, blue body paint, digital collage, poster paper, self portrait photography \n\nModels: CC in the blue, Juni in the flesh. \n\n---  \nCc & Juni are Asian diaspora artists from Oakland. Together, with their ongoing 1:1 Phase Change series on Foundation, they form a Web3 collective. Their self-portrait work represents the amalgam of two queer femme bodies colliding in time & space, both on and off the Metaverse. \n\nCc: Ann Li (Twitter: @play_w_cc Instagram: @play_w_cc) is a nonbinary self-portrait photographer & digital-media performance artist. Their work interrogates late-stage capitalism & social media culture from its own terrain. They/she grew up Chinese-American on the east coast.\n\nJuniper Yun (Twitter: @tygrpuppy Instagram: @tigerrabbittiger) is a South-Korean born, Oakland-based visual artist & writer whose work explores themes of identity, desire, & transformation. As a trans WOC, she uplifts & supports her communities.\n\n ©2022 Cc & Juni",
