    "description": "*Orchidaceae* \n\n~\n\n*Bloom* is a time-based motion project that features fleurs and fungi, warping to transcend space and time with NFT offerings in both motion, and stills. \n\nUsing slit scan and time-based techniques, a line of pixels is stretched toward the sky, rendering a surreal DNA-like helix structure as it blooms toward the sky of possibility...\n\n*Bloom* aims to inspire a sense of awe and futuristic wonder in the floral and plant life around us, and encourages us to see nature in new ways.  \n\nAs the plants transform and mutate over time, the spectacle showcases the history of species and proposes new cosmic futures. \n\n~\n\n72 seconds, h264, 1080 x 1920\n\n~\n\n[http://www.mia-forrest.com/nfts](http://www.mia-forrest.com/nfts)\n\n",
