    "description": "\"The Waiting Room\" represents life itself, full of things that make sense and have no sense at all, things chaotic and organized. It is a place of choice, movement and stillness. It is a place of birth and  a slow walk towards the end. Look closely and you might just see yourself in one of those fellows that figuring it all out.\n\nThe digital art comes with a physical piece.",
