    "description": "I've finally learnt what it means for a moment to be hauntingly beautiful.The cracks in your heart are not riffs in your soul,but roads to your core.\n\nAnger.Pain.It's getting harder to hide all the feelings I've built up inside.It's hard to explain,without being considered insane.\n\nHanding out trust without a second glance, always seeing the good in people,making excuses for their unkindness.Didn’t walk away in time.\n\nHow many earthquakes till you completely fall apart? Realize empty hearts deserve empty hands.\n\nIt's interesting the ways I’ll betray myself for you,versions of me shifted,from one person to the next,exchanging pieces of my whole-hearted spirit,for short-lived care.\n\nDecent loving child for my parents, gullible weirdo for friends,hardworker for teachers.I'm mine before I was ever yours.\n\nOne after the other. It's fatal that I know I would follow you to the end of myself,with a smile through it all.\n\nHere we go again.New one ready to serve.\n\nYours Truly\n'Welcome Mat' Heart",
