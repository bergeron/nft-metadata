    "description": "üì∏ The images in this collection were captured in the Balouchestan province of Iran, where I had the chance to live and experience the daily lives of these strong, happy, culture-rich and colorful Balouchi people.\nI saw these people like the wind. Simple-hearted but forgotten, kind but untouchable. That's why I call them the \"People Of Wind\".\n\nüíù 20% of the sale amount will be devoted to the development of remote villages in this region.\n\nBakak has been featured in multiple publications, such as the Tehran Times and the BBC, and his works have been exhibited and awarded widely. They are also held in private and public collections around the world.",
