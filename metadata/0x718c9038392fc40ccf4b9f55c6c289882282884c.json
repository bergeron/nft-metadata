    "description": "Nightmare #3.  This is one of the most intricate designs witnessed.\n\nNightmares in Binary spawned into existence while investigating a project integrating math and artificial intelligence.  While training our algorithms to be creative beyond what we were teaching them, they (accidentally?) stumbled onto a set of equations that produced images more akin to nightmares than we could have ever anticipated.   A small set of these terrors were captured, along with the equations that generated them.   As we extract more, they will be posted here.\n",
