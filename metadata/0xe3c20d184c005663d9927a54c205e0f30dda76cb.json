    "description": "\"You start by introducing yourself with a special name, a nickname perhaps,\" he said. \"When you address a Joshua Tree, you’re addressing the spirit or essence of all Joshua Trees. The same goes for any other type of tree. You can talk to dead trees too. Go ahead and have a conversation with a telephone pole. Before it held our electrical wires it saw many things, maybe it sees even more now.\"\n \nMy late friend steave happened to be an original person (Native American). He had three PhDs and seven master's degrees and he taught me to talk to trees.\n \nHe also explained to me, sternly, that we don’t always have to be serious because the Universe is not always serious. May your sky path extend into the weirdness of infinity, steave.\n\n1920x1080, 14 seconds\n\nIncludes 32x48” museum-quality print for primary\n",
