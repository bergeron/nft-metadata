    "description": "Begin transmission:// \n\nThe year is 2022. Goools are being replicated by cyber thieves. These artificial copies are laced with malicious code and intent and their goal is to infiltrate the outside chain worlds, to prey on unsuspecting victims. Blockchain technology and the distributed ledgers have made it possible to verify and safeguard against this threat. The imitations are easy to spot as they do not contain the goool deployer hash [0xD91c8...68200] in their composition. It is advised not to interact with the ersatz replicas. They are dangerous. Don't trust. Verify.\n\n//:End transmission\n\n--------\n\nRiot Goools, along with the Magical/Power/Creepy/Weird Goools and Gooolmon, are natives of the Fantom Network. The expanded Gooolniverse includes Goools on XTZ on Tezos and CypherGoool Chronicles on Ethereum.",
