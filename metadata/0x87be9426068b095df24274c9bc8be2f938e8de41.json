    "description": "Finally, Gobo allow me to get into the  Fish Head village\n\nThe essential thing for humans who wants to sneak into the Fish Head village is “the fan”. \n\nWhat does it use for?\nIt’s used to cover humans’ faces so that the Fish Head won’t notice that you are not one of them.\n\nIt sounds doesn’t make any sense, right?\nBut actually, those Fish Heads have poor eyesight. They can only see near objects clearly and they don’t even care about humans.\n\nOriginal artwork from the book “FishHead: the Fish Head village”\nI choose some characters from the book and animate them with the backgrounds.",
