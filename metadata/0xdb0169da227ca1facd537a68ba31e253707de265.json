    "name": "SWALLOW'S SOUL",
    "description": " I want to invite you to be inspired by the energy of a swallow.  A very fascinating and rare totem.  The owners of this soul are extremely peaceful people, passionate about their life and the realization of goals, swallows are very sensitive to any aggression.  For this reason, people who exude anger, envy, hatred from themselves will not be able to make friends with people whose totem is this bird.  Swallows're good at feeling latent aggression in people and don't interact with them.\n -these birds by nature have tremendous intelligence and a very high speed of thinking.They have good intuition and sensitivity, born psychics.\n  Another quality of a swallow is good luck, this happens for the reason that swallows feel their subconscious very well and don't tilt with it, hence the moment when no matter what a person does with such a totem, the whole world favors him.\n-Swallows also love travel,but at the same time there is a family,the very support to which it's so pleasant to return",
