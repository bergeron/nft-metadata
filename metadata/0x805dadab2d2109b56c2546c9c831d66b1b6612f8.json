    "description": "On a sunset photoshoot, I noticed a kid playing in the sand. All i could see was his small silhouette, I waited and waited, took multiple shots. This one stands out most to me, reminds me off the times when I was a kid and my father would play in the sand with me. Also this photo has something special in it, look at the fathers silhouette, can you see that love heart....... Beautiful ",
