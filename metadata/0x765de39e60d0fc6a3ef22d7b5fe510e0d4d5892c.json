    "name": "I am FIRE",
    "description": "Every Aries has fire deep in their soul. Growing up I had this deep understanding that I had the ability to make a difference in this world whether it was ready for me or not. Throughout the years, through a billion knock-downs & let downs I never lost focus that I am a force to be reckoned with.\nI came into this world with a mission, I will go down fighting. \nEvery single woman I have met has this in their soul whether they listen to it or not, its there churning. The strength it takes to be a woman in this world & endure everything we face is POWERFUL. I am here to remind you to keep taking those steps, keep fighting those fights, the fire within you is there watching & waiting to be released.",
