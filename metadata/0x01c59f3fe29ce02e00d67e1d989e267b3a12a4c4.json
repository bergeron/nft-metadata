    "description": "Spacecraft Commander Yappy wanders around a forgotten earth in search of his partner, JLE.\n\nYAPPY is a collection of 100 NFTâ€™s on the Ethereum blockchain. While the world was shut down for months on end due to a global pandemic and when everyone was stuck inside, myself and some close friends set out on a journey to see the great and barren American landscape. We slept in a van for two months. Our aim was to create an experimental film about an astronaut's lonely re-discovery of Earth.\n\n1/1",
