    "description": "Once upon a time... in a remote forest, behind a village called Volshen, there lived a girl. She was beautiful as the first ray of the sun, comparatively kind, even though she was engaged in witchcraft and the preparation of magic potions. She understood the language of animals and birds, all creatures from small to large that lived in the dark forest. And that girl's name was Armina.Although the poor thing did not do evil to anyone, she did not steal babies, did not take husbands away from home, the villagers did not love her, they poured mud on everything, threw stones, and last time they set a pack of dogs on. \nArmina couldn't stand it, picked up an ancient book, and brewed the most difficult of her potions. And the most dangerous. All that remained was to chant a spell, releasing powerful dark forces and plunge all the inhabitants into a deep sleep...for a hundred years.",
