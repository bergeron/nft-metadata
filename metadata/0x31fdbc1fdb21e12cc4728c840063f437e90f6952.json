    "description": "FU*K TRUMP is a photobook about how a mad man became president and nearly destroyed democracy in the process.This book started as a collection of Twitter images I thought were funny and quickly grew to be an obsession. These images brought me a little joy through the chaos of the President of the United States tweeting random bullshit during a global crisis while simultaneously destroying the lives of millions of people.Thank you to the hundreds of artists who created the art in this book, which shone a satirical light on a dark part of our history. A portion of book proceeds will be donated anonymously on your behalf to: United We Dream, a top ranked charity supporting youth immigrants in America. Enjoy, have a laugh and remember, Americans who voted for Trump are still Americans, so treat each other with the utmost respect, everyone is entitled to their dignity. The only way to see the entire book is by owning the NFT. There will only be 4545 copies of this book sold. The holders of the NFTs can download the book from this link https://app.submarine.me/iy1mWEGjhs7Cg44ghSMRqB"
