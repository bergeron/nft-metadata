    "description": "\"A Town on the Hills\" is about the streets of Shimla, a town on a ridge of the Himalayan foothills. Pretty silent at night and in days is filled with an unknown crowd of people from all around the state of Himachal.\n\nThese are the photographs that are still part of me and my life around the town for the past few years.",
