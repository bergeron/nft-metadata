    "description": "Apparently anchored in the tradition of street photography, Meditations seeks to record the contemplative process of walking around with a camera aimlessly, emptying the mind to open perception and refine the senses to the here and now.\n\nThe work is born from the fascination for what happens spontaneously, searching without prejudice, to witness light as a majestic event.\n\nAt the same time, the work generates a pause, seeking peace in the chaos of the city and of the mind. An act of rebellion in these times of anxiety and anguish, in order to share from the presence and observation, the sublime of our daily life.",
