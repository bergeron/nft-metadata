    "description": "The Skullish Pepe is my response to the Art Contest announced by CryptoSkulls on Twitter. The asked creators to submit a PEPE themed CryptoSkull and the submissions will be judged by the CryptoSkulls community via a discord vote. ‚ò†Ô∏è üê∏ ‚ò†Ô∏è \n\nAs I finished this Skullish Pepe I immediately wanted to own one and thought that you might too! I decided to make this available as an open edition until Wednesday at 12pm when they are set to announce the contest winner. Any and all proceeds from this OE will go directly to the community development non-profit work of WellBuilt Cities in Tampa. This organization is building social infrastructure and social enterprises aimed at meeting the concrete needs of vulnerable neighbors. Every Skullish Pepe minted is a direct contribution to there efforts to establish a truly well built city. \n",
