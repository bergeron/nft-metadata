    "description": "They were here before humans. Even before God...\n\nWe named and embraced everything as if it was ours in the entire world, even the universe. \n\nWe drew borders, separating people from each other,\n\nWe drew borders, when time came by cutting the roots underground!\n\nWe drew borders, over the nests of insects!\n\nAnd then we “helped” all the living things besides ourselves,\n\nWe restricted hunting, we adopted a bird with a broken wing!\n\nWe hurt them, then called them “vulnerable”\n\nWe measured intelligence, based on our own intelligence, we said smart, we said dumb. \n\nEverything was left for us, but from who?
