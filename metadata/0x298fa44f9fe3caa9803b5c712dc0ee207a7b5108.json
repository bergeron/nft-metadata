    "description": "The energy of Cambodia is exciting. From the surreal calm of the ruins, to the busy night-life of Phnom Penh, I found myself constantly in awe. At night is when you see the light leave its mark. Web3 is here and it's moving quickly. This long-exposure exemplifies that very idea, taken late-night at Independence Monument. \n\nThis photo technique is a metaphor akin to this project, that of modernization's effect on culture. The new changes the old, this technique aims to replicate painting and illustrating (old) done with new-technological methods.\n\nAn introduction to NoFoTo Photography: Societal Extinction - The Foundation Extension. They say photography is ded in the Metaverse. #11 Cambodia. AI Ξnergy. 360 DPI. Travel Photography. Illustration. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY COPYRIGHT © Let's Not Know Us.
