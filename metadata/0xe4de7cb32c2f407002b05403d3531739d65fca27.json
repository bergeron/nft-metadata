    "description": "This work ‘Blue Transience’ extends my discourse with DALL·E. Using watercolour on 300gsm cotton rag I have translated and interpreted my AI generated artwork ‘Blue Divine’ into a physical painting by my own hand. Through the act of transforming the digital into physical I infuse my xin (heart and mind) into the work – a physical exchange of qi through brush and paint on paper. In doing so I create what is referred to in the Chinese painting tradition as a ‘seal of the heart’ or ‘mind-print’. The artwork is titled differently to its AI sister-work. Through the process of its creation, using my body and mind as a medium and tool, the work becomes an entirely different object, yet a close relative to its AI counterpart, with a unique expression, process and history. We are all conduits of energy, all instruments of this world. I train my body and mind to create, much in the same way as I might shape DALL·E as a creative tool.",
