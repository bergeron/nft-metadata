    "description": "Show your support of your favorite profiles, people, and projects in the NFT space!!!\n\nI took a bunch of incredibly scientific measurements and the result was a group of some of the more impactful profiles in the NFT Space in 2022. I also took another set of measurements, and that resulted in a plethora of  poignant projects. I used the Ethereum ecosystem, as it's more important, and then added in Solana NFTs for more engagement. I heard there weren't NFTs on other chains, so whatevs. This is a very serious work of artistic expression, and I would appreciate you to treat it as such.  If you didn't make the cut, try harder for next year! This is for the community, and for the ART. This is a work of ART, and is parodical.  #1",
