    "description": "\"Take You Back\" is the leading single from X&ND's upcoming debut album XANDYLAND. Dropped during the XANDYLAND: Live In Atlanta event on April 6th, the track gives collectors an exclusive first listen to the album for a select period of time before it releases on DSP's April 14th. \n\nCaught in a vicious cycle of love, lust, and heartbreak. \"Take You Back\" exhibits X&ND at his end; wanting to break free no matter who it hurts...\n\nWritten by X&ND, Noah Sammak\nProduced by Nico Scali, i.amsolo\nMixed by i.amsolo\n",

      "text": "Verse 1\nAny time you sent me a signal \nIt was criminal \nThe way you had a hold on me \n(Hard to believe) \nDidn’t cross my mind to question\nYour intentions \nWhen you said you couldn’t love me babe\nRan away because you love the chase\n\nPre Chorus\nI’m done trying to find a way to get back to you\nAddicted to pain you put me through\nYour love like novocaine \nLoving you was my mistake, I won’t do it \nBeen here before but i’m no fool \nI need a breather \nDon’t know where to go\nBut i gotta leave you, leave you\n\nChorus\nFind another man to love you \nIf you’re waiting on my call don’t hold your breath\nfind another man to need you\nI don’t have the time to put up with your act\nFind another man to hold you \nI don’t need another damaged love like that \nFind another man to save you\nI don’t have the heart to run and take you back \n\nVerse 2\nWant me to relieve the pressure\nLay next to you\nRomance through the pain\n(Take you away )\nI’ve moved on to the next one na\nI don’t call you anymore \nAnd you’re going through hell\nWhen you see me with somebody else \n\nBridge\nNo more, I’m done\nWon’t put up with your act\n(If you’re waiting on my call don’t hold your breath, find another man to run and take you back)\nThe end for us\nNot gonna run and take you back \n",
