    "description": "The tristesse of an empty parking garage on a Sunday afternoon can be depressing to some, but also enjoyable to others.\n\nI shot this photo on a cold Sunday afternoon in February 2022. In the previous months I didn't shoot anything - it was my first photo walk of the year. At this point I had no idea how the year would turn out, let alone that I would be successful in selling street photo NFTs. \nWhat a year and it's not over yet!",
