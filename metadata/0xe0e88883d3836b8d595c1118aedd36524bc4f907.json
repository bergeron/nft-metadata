It was a great railway junction for lines that carried cargo and people in the State of São Paulo, contributing to the economic growth and strengthening of the State.\n\nThe building now belongs to the City Hall of Bauru and, despite its historical importance, is completely abandoned and destroyed.  \n--  \nTokenized image from the 'JTC' collection by photographers Oliver Reinis and Shirley Reinis.\n\nThese are ERC-1155 editions minted on a manifold smart contract.\n\nEach edition serves as a VIP Pass for future airdrops and other exclusive content.\n\nMore information and the history of the collection here:  \nhttps://reiniscouple.space\n\n3598 x 3598px  \n300dpi  \n2022  \n--  \nLICENSE: NFT holders are free to display privately and in groups, including virtual and phisical galleries, documentaries, and exhibitions by holders of the NFT, as long as the creator is credited.
