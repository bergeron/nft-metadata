    "description": "GIRYPTO's first artist collaboration collection is by Slaium, KADOKAWA GEMPAK STARZ's Chief Editor of the Comic Department and winner of the 2017 KADOKAWA’s Special President’s Award. It is made up of two pieces of extraordinary artwork featuring the Solanites – one of the ten GIRYPTO clans. These lovers of music and colours have an intimate connection with nature and consistently pray for wind and snow to assist them in their fight against their foes and to help them meet their needs.",
