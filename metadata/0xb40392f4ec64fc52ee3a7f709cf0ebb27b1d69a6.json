    "description": "Once upon a time, deep in a dense forest, there lived a wizard. He is known throughout the land for his powerful magic and dark mystical rituals.\n\nAs she flew under the moonlight, the Witch began to chant, summoning a hand spirit to aid her in her ritual, taking the form of a spectral creature, her eyes shining with moonlight. From then on the witch grew stronger, and she was feared by everyone who knew her.",
