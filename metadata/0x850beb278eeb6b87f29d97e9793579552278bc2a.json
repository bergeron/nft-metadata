    "description": "We were bound by fate, woven together and drenched in colour.....  Nothing cold stop us!\n\nThis is the first piece in my new collection [VISIONS](https://foundation.app/collection/bloomvisions?sortOrder=DEFAULT) wherein i dive deep into the practice of exploring the visionary realms through complex symmetry, vibrant colours and multi faceted illustrations.\n\nA disciple stands with eyes closed and arms wide open, she shows herself openly but keeps her words behind her mask.  She embraces the entities around her as she takes in the ways of the cosmos...\n\nWaters flow, scrolls unfurl, candles burn, roses bloom and stars fall... \nShe readies herself for a dance with fate..\n\nBe sure to follow my journey here > [WITHERBLOOMS TWITTER](https://twitter.com/WitherBloomArt)\n\n5580 X 5179 px\n40.3 MB \nPNG\n\nUpon request the owner of this NFT will receive a high quality copy of the PNG ",
