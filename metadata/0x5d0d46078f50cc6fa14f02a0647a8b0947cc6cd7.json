    "description": "7/30/09 - Delhi  \n\nYesterday I took the Rajdhani Express, an overnight sleeper train, to Delhi. I rode in 3rd class AC. My intentions had originally been to ride in 2nd class unreserved (no AC), but there were no trains with this class of seats until the next morning, so I spent about 3 times as much for an air-conditioned ride (along with the seven other people in my compartment). Fortune was smiling on me that day, because in hindsight, that 18-hour train ride would have been pretty miserable without AC.",
