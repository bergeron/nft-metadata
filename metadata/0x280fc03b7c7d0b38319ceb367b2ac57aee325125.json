    "description": "While living on the island Hainan for a year, I got reconnected with all my passions in life, the ocean and photography. I woke up every morning, with an excitement that left me feeling grateful, for what I would possibly be able to capture that day. Surrounded by nature, the ocean and coconut forests, I loved to explore this island and what it offered for me to see from the sky.",
