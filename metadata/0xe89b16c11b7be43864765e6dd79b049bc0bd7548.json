    "name": "An Artist's Vision",
    "description": "an artistâ€™s vision is mostly a vision of perfection. then we start to create. each created thing reflects our broken selves back to us. suddenly, we understand that all art is reflexive, and that we can only make things as perfect as we can be. we realize that we are imperfect, and our imperfetion is its own condition; powerful and differentiated in itself. unique in all the world. we stop chasing perfection because we realize that perfection does not exist. so we all continually progress by falling short, and yet, we evetually become gods. in the end, we bow out from the world having done our best work anyways.",
