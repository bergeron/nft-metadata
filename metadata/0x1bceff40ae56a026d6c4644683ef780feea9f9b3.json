    "description": "Juicy is a 1/1 NFT\n6000 x 4000 px\n\nOur possessions are signifiers of identity. The series Possession looks at the body as our primary possession. In producing this body of work I considered what is experienced in being embodied. Qualities such as \"juicy\" came to mind and I let my imagination run wild in its depiction. Each photograph in the series is shot similarly to equate the models' different bodies. Though disparate in appearance there is a unity that pervades them all.\n\nPossession has been shown at solo shows at Superchief Gallery's locations in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. Not A Cult published the Possession monograph, with a foreword written by Evan Pricco, editor-in-chief of Juxtapoz magazine. \n\nModel credit: Hannah Casillas",
