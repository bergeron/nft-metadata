    "description": "In LOOPER we explored the meaning and the value of repetition in nature and art. We start with the atomic structure, then move on to molecules, cells, planets and solar systems. Everything seems to use repetition in its functioning. \n\nThe concept of looping comes up again in algorithms, as in the Moebius Strip created by the mathematician and astronomer A. F. Mobius. We found it in architecture through the serial repetition of elements. \n\nFinally, repetition still recurs in the fractal theories that we represented through our interpretation of the Serpinski carpet.\n\nDetails:\n-Architectural video mapping produced by Pixel Shapes collective for the “Farnesina: Digital Experience” exhibit.\n-Location: Farnesina Palace in Rome, Italy. \n-Video of the event [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOrbNnftM5c)\n-Music by 0x-Jitzu.\n\nThe owner additionally will receive:\n-High resolution video file [.mp4 4000x1150px 30fps]\n-Uncompressed audio File [.wav 16bit 48000hz]",
