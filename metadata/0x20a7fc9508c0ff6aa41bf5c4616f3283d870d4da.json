    "description": "I'm pretty sure that we've all had those moments where we just sat and thought about things in general, like random situations where we could have acted differently and how things could have taken a different path. But why?\n\nWe have to live with our choices, so why keep our minds in a loop that we no longer control? We should just keep moving forward and try our best to make it right the next time. Life is too short for us to overthink; we could simply disappear in a second. Instead of overthinking everything, we should live our lives to the fullest. I know I'm the worst person for you to look up to because I'm truly insecure about everything, but I feel bad about it because I know I'm wrong. So please, be better than me and fight for what you want! Be happy. I love you. <3",
