    "description": "Everything we create is derived from time. As time passes by, we mingle with memories from the past, the moment we live in and our vision of the future.\n\nThe Entrapped memories are the representation of our inspirations, materialised by unknown forms of life, that seem to have been captured by other forces, far from the human reach. \n\nEach of these art pieces have at their core a video sequence auto-generated by a deep learning model that learned from what expresses the essence of Roman Kyn’s EP “Consequences”: the lyrics. \n\nThe output is what animates the moving lights within the abstract forms.\n\n-----\n\nFar away, under the burning sun, hidden among the dunes\nNo matter the consequences, we become as dry as the desert\nOur eyes looking at each other, with a fire burning inside\nWe can finally see the sun, reflecting in our hearts\n \n\n\n",
