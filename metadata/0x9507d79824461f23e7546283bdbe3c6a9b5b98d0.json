    "description": "Home is the place where we start our journey in life.\n\nHome is the most beautiful and comfortable place because of the presence of loved ones such as parents and other families, making the home more reassuring.\n\nMaybe the house is not a magnificent building, but it contains many priceless stories. Many beautiful memories created while at home.\n\nThis is what makes many people often miss the atmosphere of home, especially when traveling. When homesick, not a few people express it in words."
