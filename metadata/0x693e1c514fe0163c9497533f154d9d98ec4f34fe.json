    "description": "‘Entropy’ is an exploration of time. An iterative dialogue between two artists (Claire Salvo and Daniel N. Johnson) to reinterpret a self-portrait via their respective mediums by freezing, accelerating, and expanding time. Three tools were used to create this image: a camera, to freeze a moment of self-examination. Photoshop, to accelerate time and imagine a process of decay. And finally, a Bic ballpoint pen to indelibly expand and imprint this modified fraction of a second over the course of two months onto a piece of paper. The original 1/1 physical drawing, measuring 22''x30'' will be custom-framed and sent to the primary collector. In the weeks that follow this mint, a series of 20 physical-only prints will be released. Each will be hand-embellished in a variety of media, creating 20 new 1/1s.",
