    "description": "\"The Mere Pounamu is the most valuable of the Māori short-hand weapons carefully shaped and carved out of greenstone. Its texture depicts the natural beauty of water. The weight of the mere pounamu gave the weapon it’s deadly effect, as one swinging blow to the enemy’s head, was enough to end his or her life. The mere pounamu also has healing properties such as in karakia and is also used to connect to the environment in which the pounamu derives from.”  \n     Nā Josh Strickland\n\nThe primary buyer of this NFT will also receive a 95x95cm framed print.  \n",
