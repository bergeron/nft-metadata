    "description": "Pic n Clip Glitch NFT was a by-product of a crash that happened during an edit session. I have made Pic n Clips for the last 4 years, they usually are 72\" x 48\" prints that contain multiple images that I cull from a folder called “Pic n Clip” (named after the coupon drawer in the kitchen of the house I grew up in suburban Atlanta). I was trying to animate the Pic n Clip as an mp4 and this flashed on the screen. I took a screenshot of it and then it disappeared. Presented in collaboration with Andrew Kreps Gallery.\n\n\nThis NFT has been certified by Verisart https://verisart.com/works/941dad84-7703-406a-89e0-a935e8db9f1c",
