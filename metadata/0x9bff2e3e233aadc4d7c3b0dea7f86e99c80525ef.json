Collectively, this series serves as a visual dictionary of skateboardingâ€™s endless variation. Photographed sequences (shot in person) are used as references to create animations of said tricks, and the contexts of branding, likeness, and environment is removed to avoid any distraction from the physical form of the trick itself.",
