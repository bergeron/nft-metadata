    "description": " Kap River Nature Reserve, Eastern Cape\n\nA few years ago, at the invitation of my friends, I embarked on a long journey. \nIn South Africa, I realized the full potential of the words \"beauty\" and \"diversity\" in all their aspects. \n\nSometimes the landscape reminded me of green Europe, and only an hour later, Africa was unfolding in all its glory in the way books and movies have shaped our view of the continent. \n\nIn South Africa, I met remarkable and warm-hearted people who often responded with a hug to my outstretched hand. \nTo each photo I took, I embedded some of the love I have for this place and for the people who live there.",
