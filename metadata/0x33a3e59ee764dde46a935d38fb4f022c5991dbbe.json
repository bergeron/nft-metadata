    "description": "Alone with nature, human begins to get to know himself. He begins to see what his strength is, what his potential is. Nature calms the mind and brings man back to his essence. There is no city noise, just the fresh gently tickling air of the sea and you. \nJust stop and just listen to what nature is whispering to you. \nThere is only this moment, the rest doesn't matter.\n\nPhoto: 5648  x  7060",
