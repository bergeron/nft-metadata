    "description": "“Carnival is a period of popular festivals held during the day and night. The celebrations take place every year, in the months of February or March, starting on Saturday and extending until Tuesday of Carnival.\n\nCarnival celebrations end on Ash Wednesday, the day that marks the beginning of Lent — a 40-day period that runs until Good Friday, two days before Easter.\n\nCarnival parties are adapted according to local history and culture. In general, people dance, eat and drink happily at parties, masquerade balls, costume balls, parades of blocks, samba schools, electric trios and even on the street itself.\"\n\nThis NFT collection is dedicated to the biggest popular party in the world.\n\nI was there for a few days and it was really fun. Grab your costume and go have fun.",
