    "description": "I'm an artist from Ukraine.There is a war going on in my country right now. Entire cities are being wiped off the face of the earth. Children are dying. Families are breaking up and leaving their homes. But my people are not broken. We keep fighting. The Russian army may destroy our homes, but they cannot take our freedom and love of life. When we win, we have a lot of work to do and we will raise our country from the ashes. \n\nRight now I am safe. And I believe that creativity is my tool to serve my people. Even from a distance, I want to be useful to my country and help people who stayed in the war zone. \n\nThe artwork \"Rise from the Ashes\" is created in support of love, peace and healing at a time when we need it most. \n\n100% of all sales of this work will be donated to help families affected by the war zone.
