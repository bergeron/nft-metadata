    "description": "Light and shade is one of the basic elements of sketching, and it is an important factor to describe the three-dimensional and spatial effects of objects. Any object will show a certain light-dark relationship under the illumination of light. The intensity of the light source, the distance from the light source and the different illumination angles will cause the object image to show different brightness and darkness.",
