    "description": "by Ignat Shumilin\n\n\"In 2020, I was drafted into the army. In my country, service is mandatory for men from 18 to 27 years old. Students have a postponement, but by that time I had already graduated from the university.\n\nIn the military unit, I quickly realized that the role of a simple soldier is boring and useless. So I decided to tell military authorities that I knew how to take photos. After a few weeks they brought me a camera and I started shooting our battalion. One lieutenant even invited me to film his wedding, but while I was serving, he did not get married.\n\nOne frosty and foggy autumn morning, I was ordered to film how ensigns and officers were engaged on the parade ground. On the way to the place, I saw a group going to the exercises — three officers and two ensigns in a thick fog, illuminated by the diffused light of the lazy morning sun, gathered in a team as if to save the world from monotonous photographs\".\n\nCamera — Fujifilm XT-2\nLens — Fujinon 18mm",
