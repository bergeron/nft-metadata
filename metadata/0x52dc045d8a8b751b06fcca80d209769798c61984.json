    "description": "\"You talk so much, but u don't do anything\"\n\"Concrete\" series\n\nThis work is about overconsumption and sustainable development. Large print run-to make it available and distribute it as a reminder. We live in the heyday of capitalism, which has taught us not to think about the consequences, and creates a sense of lightness and security. \"Take more, buy more boldly, we give for free\" We do not think about what resources it requires human and natural. We buy more, quickly get tired of what was easy, and immediately try to fill our ego with new and unnecessary purchases. Waste is a product of our vital activity, which increasingly fills our body and environment. It's a ticking time bomb if you don't start changing by throwing the chewing gum in the litter bin.\n\nBy the link you will get high res. digital artwork & framed printed poster with a qr-code for the token.\nWith respect. Ilya",
