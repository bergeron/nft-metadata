    "description": "The first NFT I've ever minted was titled Radiant Sun and Moon at rarible on the 9/18/2020. (Lost that wallet ) :(\n\nIt's been a long time since then and I've created a bunch of NFTs in many styles, but most importantly I've been getting better at being a creator slowly but surely. The space has evolved drastically since I started and we are seeing new styles and new means of creating constantly making this space lively and exciting to be in.\n\nThis piece was made not only to bring back my first NFT, but to also show that I'm here to stay in the NFT space and will always be a creator striving for better and better :)\n\nThank you for reading ",
