    "description": "In 2020 one of Pixellitist's earliest mints was a digital recreation of Andy Warhol's famous Mao portrait. \nSince then the piece has been bought, sold and resold with no loss only gain in value. \n\nThis current piece is a most recent iteration, one of a cross-chain series entitled \"Andy's Iterations\" which debuted on Tez then found it's way to Rarible and now this modified generation has landed on Foundation as a 1 of 1 genesis piece of this 2022 collection. Commemorating the Mao recreation which also use height mapping as a style aesthetic.  \n\nThis will be the only Andy's Iterations minted on Foundation.\n\nPeace & Pixels.\n\n",
