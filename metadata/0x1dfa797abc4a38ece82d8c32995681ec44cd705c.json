    "description": "Close your eyes. Can you hear the ticking of the grandfather clock? The waves crashing onto the shore from the balcony? The birds softly singing? I invite you to gently take a step into the living room of two of the most important people in my life - my grandparents. All of these sounds and feelings live in my soul, deeper than any other memory. These two played a very large role in raising me and teaching me about art, and for that my gratitude is endless, and love unconditional.\n\nDuring a family dinner I stepped away to capture this image. I wanted to freeze time, as we never know how much longer we have. This photo was taken on film, which naturally gives it that lived-in, nostalgic feeling. I decided to enhance and alter the bright colors in order to give it some life, and contrast with a youthful, bright energy. After all, this is the same energy they helped instill in me.\n\nEdition - 1/1  \nArtist - Saige Carlson",
