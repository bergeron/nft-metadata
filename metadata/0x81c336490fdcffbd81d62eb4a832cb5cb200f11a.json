    "description": "\"One must still have chaos within oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.\" Nietzsche. Astraea is the goddess of justice who, according to Greek myths, brings the Golden Age upon the Earth. For me, her being a goddess of the Golden Age is linked to her being a goddess of balance and justice. When there is harmony and fairness, there is space for a better future to be birthed. The ancient Romans and Greeks hoped for her return so they would be able to reignite a new Golden Age. Later during the European Renaissance, Astraea became associated with the spirit of cultural renewal occurring at that time. In England, she was often mentioned in poems and alongside the figure of Queen Elizabeth I reigning over a new Golden Age. Interesting facts: (1) The Aster flowers — which are bright purple and yellow — are named after this goddess; (2) it is believed that Astraea's tears for the lost Golden Age gave birth to the Aster flowers on Earth, and their bright purple color and starry shape reminded people of happier times. Card: New beginnings, justice, and balance. \nThis card is a tribute to Tinfoil",
