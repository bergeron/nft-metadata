    "description": "Alt_Momentum is one of the first series of creations developed by Xcrypt and it lays the foundations of an art built on the influences of  previous works.\nAs generative art enthusiasts, the team behind Xcrypt produces formal work influenced by the memories of cultural and technological movements.\nAltMomentum consists of four sequences containing four extracts from cult films: Casablanca by Michael Curtiz (1942), Apocalypse Now by Francis Ford Coppola (1979), Blade Runner by Ridley Scott (1982), Fight Club by David Fincher (1999 ).\nEach of these excerpts ranging from twenty seconds to a minute and a half is not immediately recognizable because it is only using a wave produced by a sinusoid, an alternative and minimal recreation, a representation of the original workâ€™s spectrum . The minimal process behind the extract forces the acuity of the memory without damaging the original by producing a spectrum of it.   ",
