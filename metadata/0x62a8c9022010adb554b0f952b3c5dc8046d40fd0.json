    "description": "Know qin Emperor and Han Wu? Many fans of entertainment will know the songs of Korean stars, the movies they made, and even their schedules to the minute on a given day. How many of them can tell what emperor Qin Shihuang did in a certain year or a certain month without looking up information? How many years did Emperor Wudi have and how many battles did he have against the Huns? I wouldn't have written it if most young readers knew more about our country's history than our current stars.)\n\n\n\nEvery time he saw this, Tiandao felt deeply saddened and felt the need to make the classical Chinese in historical books easy to understand through the form of novels, so that more people can understand the history of our country and our nation, and restore the confidence and pride of the nation from the bottom of my heart.",
