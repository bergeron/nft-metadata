    "description": "heyoooo\n\nmy name is Buku, and i’ve been producing music for a minute.  i spend most of my time in the bass music realm, but i’ve been experimenting with many other flavors- especially in recent years.  \n\nthis is a track that i started during the pandemic when i was seeing someone.  they ended up breaking it off in a pretty shitty fashion, so i did what any musician would do- i wrote a song about it.  \n\nangsty and somewhat emo - this track explores a realm of my songwriting that people haven’t really heard before.  “no more” would have just lived and died on a hard drive otherwise, so im stoked to have an outlet for my B-sides.  enjoy, friends.
