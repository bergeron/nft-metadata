This project started out as a portal and evolved into an entirely something different.\nSomething dreamy/space like.\n\nThis was one of the intensive personal projects I have done.\n\nResponsible for everything: landscape, particle flow, portal, BG clouds, and stars. \n\nDone with Houdini and Redshift.\nCompositing done in Nuke",
