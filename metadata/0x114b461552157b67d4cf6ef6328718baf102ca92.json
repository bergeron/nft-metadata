    "description": "July 15th, 2021, watching the fog roll through Mt. Rainier, was my favorite day to take photographs. This was my first day in nature, exploring my camera to the fullest. This day, I was up at 3:30 to catch the blue hour and did not fall asleep until the next day after viewing the milky way. This is one of my fondest memories, as it is the day that genuinely kickstarted my love for moody photography and my passion for watching the fog roll through the landscapes. \n\nExtended Editorial License: NFT holder is free to display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, docuseries, and public gatherings hosted by the NFT holder, requiring that the NFT creator (Alex Blackburn) is credited.
