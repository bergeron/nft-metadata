    "description": "What kind of image do you have of tunnels?\nSome people may have an image of it being scary because it is the setting for ghost stories.\nFor me, tunnels are symbols of \"secret doors leading to other worlds = hope\" and \"going through the darkness with no way out = suffering.\n\nThat is why I often bring up tunnels when I draw stories. \nThe more I am troubled when I paint, the more I want to paint, and the more I struggle to find a way to express my pain and distress, and I feel as if I am going deeper and deeper into the ground.\nThere are times when a \"slump\" comes when We are painting.\nThe darkness where you cannot see the path may be called a slump.\nIt takes courage to go through the darkness.\nI believe that going through a tunnel is to connect suffering to hope through courage.\nNo matter how hard and painful it is, we want to have the courage to go through the darkness toward the light.\n\nWhen I paint tunnels, I do so with this wish in mind.",
