    "description": "Every one of us spends our lives in two worlds simultaneously. One physical and tangible and the other a world created in our minds.\nWith \"Invasion of the Mind,\" I intend to depict the world of our mind in the person seen sitting in the middle of the painting. To better convey the impalpable aspect of this world, I excluded the shadows cast on her by the other individuals. Seen at the top left of the painting are two hands taken from \"The Death of Socrates\" by Jacques-Louis David and \"Virgin of the Rocks\" by Leonardo da Vinci. My intention for choosing these specific features from two of the greatest painters is to show the eternal aspect of this elusive world and the influence of our predecessors. With the hand seen at the top right corner of the painting, which belongs to the main subject, I intended to portray that the best person we can truly count on is ourselves. Finally with the vague portrait of the main subject in the back I demonstrated the silence of the inner self.",
