    "description": "\"TODAY IS... the best day of the week.\"\n\n\"Scrub Sink Thoughts\" is a timelapse collection capturing the presurgical ritual hand scrub and pensive moments before surgery.   Rehearsed minutes of solitude often used as preemptive moments to visualize and gather one's thoughts.  This is an inaugural series of 9 photos... some limited edition, some black and white and some 1/1's.",
