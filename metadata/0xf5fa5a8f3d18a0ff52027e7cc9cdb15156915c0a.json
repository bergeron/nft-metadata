    "description": "AI, 3D, Digital. 8K+.\n\nSotheby's Contemporary Day Auction  \n3 March 2022  \nLondon\n\nCreated using a blend of 3D, digital painting, and the AI-collaborative painting tool, \"prosepainter.\" Prosepainter was created by Joel Simon, Victor Perez, and Morphogen. \n\nThe AI draws from the aesthetics of John Singer Sargent, Abbott Handerson Thayer, John William Waterhouse, Evelyn De Morgan, Gustav Klimt, and John William Godward. The artist endeavors to imbue a sense of cultural heritage--and further, a sense of qualia--into work created collaboratively with AI. \n\nThe experience of a generation inheriting the Earth. Centuries of lineage culminating into a point of divergence. The human and the artificial. Cassandra, Pandora, Eve. Disruptive innovation arrives.",
