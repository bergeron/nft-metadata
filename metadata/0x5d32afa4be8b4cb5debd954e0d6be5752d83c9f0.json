    "description": "Shot taken in Singapore, 2020. \n\nThis was taken from a roof pub in Raffles Place, the busiest hub in Singapore. \n\nIt was after working hours and my team of colleagues decided to have a drink to end that day. I took notice of this building that has the design which looks number 13 from far and decided to take this shot. \n\nAlso, this is my 13th NFT overall release on foundation, hence I thought it may be apt to release this now :) ",
