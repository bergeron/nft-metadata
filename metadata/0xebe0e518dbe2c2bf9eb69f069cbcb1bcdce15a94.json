    "description": "I had the pleasure of capturing the original portrait image on July 21st, 2022, during an official Ledger NFT event on a boat in front of the iconic Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nWhat drew me to this particular moment was the sense of ease and confidence that Jean-Michel Pailhon exuded. As stated in some of his social accounts he call himself as NFT & crypto maximalist  \nFiat minimalist. He is working on making digital art (NFT) more accessible to institutional investors.\n\nI worked with natural lighting, as most of my works i like to simplify the details for viewer and focus more on forms. With the edit and pfp creation i tried to simplify as i can. At the moment of creation, blue hat is a symbol for Mr Pailhon so i keep it in the portrait.  \n \nI strive to tell a story through my images as a photographer by capturing the essence of the moment. It has much more simplicity with all the embedded symbols in this portrait that has been turned into a PFP.\n\nThis work is part of a collection <Once Upon a Time NFTs> which tries to keep documenting the moment of NFTs starting from 2021\n\nI am honoured to have had the opportunity to create this work.  I hope that viewers will be able to connect with the emotion and energy of the moment, and that this portrait will serve as a lasting reminder of that experience.",
