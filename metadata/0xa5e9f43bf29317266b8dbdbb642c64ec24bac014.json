    "description": "Once upon a time, on a clear, crisp night, a woman stood outside gazing up at the starry sky. In her hand, she held a small hand clock and a lit candle. The clock was old and well worn-worn. She had inherited it from her father, who had always told her to use it to keep track of the passing of time.\n\n She had always love stargazing, and on this particular night, the stars seemed to be especially bright and beautiful.\n\nShe closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath, savoring the cool, crisp air. \nShe opened her eyes and looked up at the sky and saw her clock spinning, her candle then went out! Feeling scared she found herself enveloped in a bright light and heard her father’s voice, who said “This is your inner light, you are as bright as the stars you gaze upon, go back and don’t be afraid to shine your light anymore”. Her clock froze and she woke up back home. Engraved now on the clock we’re the words “I love you my shining star”.\n\nAi + Photoshop\n",
