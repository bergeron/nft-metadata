    "description": "I am so excited to finally share my genesis drop on Sound.xyz called “Keep On.” I made this track halfway through 2021 when I started touring again after nearly a year off for the pandemic. \n\nIve always enjoyed making house music, but for the Party Pupils project I've always leaned more into funkier boom-bap mid-tempo electronic. “Keep On” is what I consider my flagship tune for my house music project called “Neon Don.” \n\nI realized after I played my first couple shows of 2021 that house music had exploded again, and any of the house tunes I played went off so much harder than anything else. It really inspired me to commit to this project and see how my take on house music would be perceived. It’s been such a joy working on this project, and I hope you all feel that too. ",
