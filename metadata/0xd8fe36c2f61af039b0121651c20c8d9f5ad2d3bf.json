    "name": "Lightning catchers",
    "description": "In the magical art universe – Napasio World, there is such a profession, or rather, even a vocation — lightning catchers.\n\nThe secret knowledge about how to catch lightning has been passed on by hunters for thousands of years, and to master this truly magical skill, you need to start training from childhood.\n\nAt the same time, almost anyone with the right approach can become a lightning catcher, so among them you can meet absolutely different inhabitants of Napasio World: from primitive but good-natured Buckleys from a Soft Island to insidious snakes from the Valley of Living Stones.\n\nLightning is a very valuable commodity in many worlds, but for whom and why – we have yet to find out.",
