    "description": "The world is absurd and independent of human circumstances. But the world exists in the first place because there is an observer, the human being. Without the observer, the world would not exist. So the world is arbitrary and only looks the way humans want to see it. Do not think that there is any meaning. There is no meaning to anything.",
