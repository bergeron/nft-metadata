    "description": "As an artist and music enthusiast, I've always found inspiration in the concerts I attend. Between 2013 and 2016, I had the incredible opportunity to see some of my favorite musicians perform live, including Muse, Metallica, Roger Waters, Deep Purple, Woodkid, Sigur Ros, and more. Some of these concerts took place in Istanbul, Turkey, while others were in Dublin, Ireland. I saved every single ticket from these shows, and years later, I decided to turn them into a work of art. I carefully glued each ticket onto a canvas and painted around them to create a beautiful, nostalgic piece that represents my teenage years. This unique piece tells my story and reflects how music has shaped my life and influenced my art. I invite you to join me in celebrating this connection between music and art by owning a piece of my story.",
