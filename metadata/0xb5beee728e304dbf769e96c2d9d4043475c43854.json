    "description": "*Owner of NFT has the option of receiving a signed print of the purchased NFT*\n\"You Devised Me to Question Everything\" is about being in what you think is a healthy relationship until that relationships ends. Without love-blinders on, plus time to reflect, I personally realized all of the reasons why my ex partner and I were wrong for each other-- even though during our relationship we thought we were perfect together. I have created a poem for this artwork and it goes like this:\n\nYou toyed with my heart\nYou played with my head\nAs if I were merely a pawn\nin your wicked game of chess\nAnd after you left\nthe fog lifted so I could see so clearly \nthat I had an epiphany,\n\nYou devised me to question everything.",
