    "description": "The “LET IT BURN // A CELEBRATION” collection was created from 50 different oil pastel drawings that capture the raw, primal energy of humans dancing around a fire. These artworks reflect the current state of the planet, a world on the brink of collapse, where everything seems to be burning down around us.\n\nAll of the drawings used in this collection are powerful and emotive depictions of the human form, captured in the moment of uninhibited movement and release. The flames of the fire provide a dramatic focus for these figures, illuminating their forms and highlighting their expressive gestures.\n\nLet’s all dance around the fire & welcome the end of the world.",
