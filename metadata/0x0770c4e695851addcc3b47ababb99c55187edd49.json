    "description": "HIKARI tries to express the music of the future. We do not define the music of the future with words abstract or concrete. Instead, we believe that it is free, active and full of technological imagination.\nThere are 1000 “Genesis NFT”s this time. There are three kinds of records: gold, silver and black. In addition, a variety of different record styles are created by changing stylus, record player, background art and moji design. Ultimately, the rarity of each NFT is different. There are also 10 ultra-rare versions of Kurosaki’s design (1% of the total) and is also the rarest of the 1000 NFTs.",
