    "description": "Portrait of an elderly lady who lost her home and some relatives during the Gorkha earthquake (Nepal). \n\nAt the date of the shot (2018) she was still living in a temporary sheet metal shack.\n\nGorkha was a severe earthquake that struck near the city of Kathmandu in central Nepal on April 25, 2015. \n\nAbout 9,000 people were killed, many thousands more were injured, and more than 600,000 structures in Kathmandu and other nearby towns were either damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe earthquake was felt throughout central and eastern Nepal, in northern India, and northwestern Bangladesh, as well as in the southern parts of the Plateau of Tibet and western Bhutan.\n\nNowadays, there has been 93 percent progress in the reconstruction of private houses which is the main area but there are still many people living in temporary structures, waiting for the end of that nightmare.",
