    "description": "A Walk in the Woods by Hulki Okan Tabak\n\nAn imaginary journey through sculpted woods where strangers vanish into deceptive forest canopy strewn with ancient monuments, elder trees and splashes of water. \n\nAn outdoor journey towards the inner self, towards a greater unity with -- what?\n\nInspired by the beauty and the mystery of nature which both within and outside.\n\n1/1 photographs created with landscape photography, AI prompts and final manual editing.\n\n\"somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond  \nany experience, your eyes have their silence:  \nin your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,  \nor which i cannot touch because they are too near\"  \n---from somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond by e. e. cummings",
