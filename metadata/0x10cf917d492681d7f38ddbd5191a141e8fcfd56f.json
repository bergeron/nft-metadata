At 800 ft, along the Han River, we flew the required route along the trace to validate our understanding of its boarder. The nights fog, the lack of illumination from the moon, gave me this opportunity to capture and share. A moment out of the cockpit of our helicopter on the Seoul Trace.\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
