    "description": "This token entitles the owner to a physical Mac Crypto Terminal as described at twitter.com/cryptoterminals. This is an original working-condition Mac Plus computer with custom software and hardware running a graphical crypto price-terminal over Wifi. It shows ETH, BTC, DAI/USDC/USDT and Punksfloor prices in USD. Details on the hardware and software (which are external to the Plus and can be swapped-in in the event of a failure) are at github.com/cryptoterminals. Price updates depend on the free Coingecko API.\n\nThe token artwork is a colorized high-resolution photograph taken directly off the CRT of a Mac Plus computer, and the artwork was hand-drawn using Mac Paint on the Mac Plus. The terminal software is created in Hypercard using some original art and some Hypercard clip-art. \n\nThe artist asks the owners to carefully pack and ship the terminal or agreed components to any subsequent owners of the token.\n\nTHIS NFT INCLUDES A WORKING PHYSICAL MAC CRYPTOTERMINAL",
