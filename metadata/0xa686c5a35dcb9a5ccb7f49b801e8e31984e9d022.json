    "description": "During my visit to Masai we encountered almost all the animals within three days of time but missing were Leopard and Giraffe. On day 3 I changed my vehicle and decided to try the second one. It was a very moody day and the driver (Philip Naurori) decided to go a different direction in search of some interesting scenes and he noticed this bunch of Giraffes. While we were shooting, suddenly the climate got worse and a sand storm started to form and I was so worried as I was thinking I was going to miss the chance to shoot something extraordinary as Philip started the vehicle and yelled something. Later I realized that Philip was yelling about the opportunity formed right in front of us.Once the storm formed and giraffes got panicked and started running and our Philip suddenly moved us towards a better position and I got what I wanted. It was not that common to see Giraffes running because of their huge size but we were lucky enough to witness this and thank Philip for his amazing scenes for photography.",
