    "description": "The Memphis-bred singer/songwriter, composer, and classically-trained violinist V.C.R shares her first single of 2023 named “Blue (Lafemmebear Remix),” from her highly praised debut LP \"The Chronicles of a Caterpillar: The Egg\" last year. Always keeping it in the family, V.C.R slow-cooked this meal with the help of co-producer “Lafemmebear”, in celebration of Women's History month and solidarity with the trans community. The “cinematic soul” singer produced this nostalgic siren song as a sensual hypnotic ode to celibacy. Inspired by Martha Wash’s “Gonna Make You Sweat”, V.C.R continues to reinvent herself as she embarks on a new journey with her fans and supporters.",
