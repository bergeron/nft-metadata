    "description": "“Now you say you’re sorry\nFor being so untrue (to your body)\nWell, you can cry me a liver\nCry me your liver\nI cried a bile over you”\n\n…Paying homage to the jazz classic “Cry Me a River” sung by forever-talented queen Ella Fitzgerald.\nNow these are obviously not the original lyrics, just in case.\n\nAnyways, if you’re feeling sorry for your organs for any harmful habits, just remember that one day it may be a bit too late to compensate.\n\n\n---\nHand-carved stamp print with digital illustration.\n\nTeineko is a hand-carved stamp artist with a medical license. I create art that may make one reflect upon their own body and appreciate life.  \n\nThe Medical Jazz Quartets collection is dedicated to Keio University School of Medicine’s jazz society with the same name. \nAn endless source of inspiration that taught me that I can be medical, musical, and artistic at the same time.",
