Can you tell me where this is?\n\nDo you want me to guide you out of here? You’re not afraid, are you?\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nI’m on my way home, my dear.\n\nWhy do things always have to change? I don’t want to be on my own again. Oh, Rose. This is a terrible place.\n\nDon’t be afraid.\n\nI don’t know what I should do.\n\nBe brave, little one. Be brave. Sleep, little one. \nAnd when you wake, I might be gone.\nSleep...\nLook around!\nYou will find your own way home.”\n\nDimensions: 3500 × 2334",
