    "description": "While on a trip to Switzerland, I felt stuck. \nWe were hiking a lot but the weather was too good for my taste : a big blue sky and the sun. \nAfter 2 days of hiking I hadn't taken a single photo. \nWe were quite tired but decided that the only way I'd be able to take photos would be to hike for sunrise. \nWe started at 5 in the morning in order to get to the top at 7:30. The hike was quite tough and I was walking as fast as I could to not miss sunrise. \n\nI arrived at the lake 5 minutes after my friend, I was so tired! I just sat there as the sun started to rise, it was absolutely amazing. We took a couple images and enjoyed the rest of sunrise while eating breakfast near the water. \n\nThat one photo made the trip worth it. I'm so happy that we had the courage to wake up early for the sunrise. Since then, I've never been lazy to wake up for sunrise.",
