    "description": "Type: Generative Art\nEdition: 1/1\nCollection: Deterministic Chaos\nSize: 2000x2000\nCreated: 2022\n\nThe double pendulum is one of the simplest chaotic systems of nature; systems being extremely sensitive to initial conditions.\n\nThis piece reveals how six double pendulums being released with virtually the same initial conditions (changes in starting angle and arm length < 0.1%) fall into complete chaos after only a few seconds, while staying utterly fascinating and mesmerizing to look at long after each pendulum has gone its own way.\n\nThis artwork was created to accompany and celebrate the \"Deterministic Chaos\" article in [ARTCODE #2](https://www.redlion.news/studios/artcode-2)",
