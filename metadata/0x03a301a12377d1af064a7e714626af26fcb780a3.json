    "description": "Hamnøy, a small fishing village in Norway and this place was in my bucket list for a very long time to shoot.\n\nFortunately I was able to visit Norway in 2020 before COVID-19 lockdowns. Shooting this village was very tricky as we have to shoot from above a bridge with on going Traffic at night.\n\nHamnøy is a gorgeous place and witnessing Hamnøy under the Aurora was a marvelous experience.\n\n5330 x 7000 (300DPI)",
