    "description": "The combined flow variations of the \"Nature's Remembrance\" series, airdropped to all first collectors. \n\n\"Nature's Remembrance\" consists of 12 variations - all unique, all 1/1s - each with their own expression, but within the same framework.\n\nThe series was created as a site specific work for my solo exhibition during the performance festival Ã˜KANT in Marstal (DK) 2021. The series was shot inside the factory hall where my exhibition took place, to fulfil the festival prompt of artworks being locally and site specifically anchored.",
