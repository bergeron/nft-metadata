    "description": "\"This is the story of the water boys\" \n\nSoul brothers everyone calls them. They're the brothers from different mothers, different backgrounds but connected by water. Yet no one knew.\n  \nWhen they first met one another, the first one said  to the others saying \" brother \".\n\nThe second said \" are we truly brothers? Why should we call ourselves brothers?  When we do not share any striking resemblance!\n\nThe third one then said to the other two saying \" Yes we're the soul brothers. we're of different mothers, different blood, yet we're connected by this water, which is Earth. Our love shall wax strong, and shall unite\"\n\nThen the other 2 said to him \" hmmm! we shall then tell our our beautiful story to the world, how we became soul brothers\"\n\n\nA short African story written by me .\n",
