    "description": "Through this collection, I aim to showcase the unrealistic expectations and distorted views that are often perpetuated in our society, particularly when it comes to food and body image. By exaggerating the size and proportions of various desserts, I aim to highlight the absurdity of these unrealistic standards and encourage audiences to question and challenge them.\n\nHowever, the collection is not just a commentary on the negative effects of these standards, but it also serves as a reminder of the power of art to shape our perceptions and beliefs. By depicting these exaggerated desserts in a humorous and whimsical manner, I aim to promote a positive and healthy relationship with food and body image.\n\n\n.\nBy Hackerman HKDAO Collective"
