    "description": "Iâ€™ve enjoyed making computers do things since the 1980s when I first started making drawings in Logo Programming language on an Apple II with a CRT-based green monochrome screen. The prompts in AI art tools like MidJourney remind me a little of those days where a sequence of commands was arranged and then the computer went off to make the drawing. I have also always enjoyed how the spirograph toy made it so anyone could make art: choose a couple wheels and some pen colors and art happens. The technical output for the spirograph is called Hypotrochoid. I spent nearly two decades as an observer of the streets and people of New York City so the Jets on the Street are in recognition of those times.\n\nPrompt: Hypotrochoid on black background with blue lazers drawing the patterns via a 555 tooth wheel inside a 6764 tooth wheel.\n\nMade with: MidJourney 4 and Affinity Photo 2",
