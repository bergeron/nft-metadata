    "description": "The first of the series, the first event on this journey\n\n\"an anointed man loses everything,\nhis hope, his love and his sanity,\nall in an attempt to awaken a new light.\n\nunder the last rains, under the red sun, away from the strange man, the birds run free\n\nA man who craved light and a woman born with it, surely the world can bear the demise; a woman born of the earth becomes a fallen sacrifice\n\nAnd as the clouds keep weeping,\nhe is left broken,\nas though,\nnature never forgave him.\"",
