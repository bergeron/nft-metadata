    "description": "Twosee is a trans drag performer who moved to Los Angeles from Mississippi to escape the toxic transphobic and racist environment she was stuck in- but also to become sober from a heroin addiction of over 6 years. The black tar we were using in the shoot had stuck to her arms and sides, and to her hands and breasts. This photo was taken as she was freeing herself from the sticky stringy grips of it.\n\nHere she sits: triumphant, powerful, and made more beautiful by the stains of her past.",
