    "description": "Since I was a young man, I have been taking regular trips to the Scottish Highlands and no spot sums up the untamed beauty and magic of Scotland than the Jacobite train crossing the Glenfinnan viaduct. The train has been crossing the viaduct for many years but truly caught the attention of the masses following the release of the Harry Potter films. Whilst a lot of photographers complain about how busy the area has now become, I personally love it. Watching young children witnessing the scene from their favourite book/movie first hand and the look of pure joy on their faces as the train sounds it horn as the steam bellows from the engine makes it an even more memorable location to photograph.\n\nLicense: Can be used to display privately, in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
