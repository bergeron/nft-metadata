    "description": "The purpose of making this portrait is that my interest in cats has increased recently. When I discovered it, I realized that they had so many cute features that I started to sympathize with them over time. I came to my mind to create pictures of these cute booties and I created 1524 pictures.\n\nWhile embarking on this journey, I tried to include many cultures and lifestyles. I'm sure many of you can find reflections of yourself in this portrait. :)\n\nWhy 1524? My first encounter with this number started when I moved to another school in the 5th grade. sometimes when looking at the time (24 hour format), sometimes on a phone number, sometimes on warning signs, sometimes on license plates, etc. places that caught my attention. I decided to use this number in my work. Even though I couldn't understand what he meant, I thought it would be appropriate to use it in the artistic field at least, and I created this work.",
