    "description": "“Jumping Peaburgler” - Wharton. June 2022.\nLooping Video: 15 sec. 2000px w. 2000px h.\n3 unique 1/1 editions \n\nJumping Peaburgler is the first of many specimens to inhabit a larger virtual menagerie of digital creatures. \n\nThis series of sketches uses virtual reality sculpting and stop motion techniques to create gestural and fluid compositions. Utilizing the “automatic drawing” method invented by the surrealists, these works are created subconsciously and intuitively—their resulting form dictating their function and motion. \n\nHolders gain access to the full menagerie show in Los Angeles as well as scheduled private viewings. \n\nSound design: Erik Shiboski\n",
