    "description": "I think it’s obvious to all, Collectors love Art that incorporates a skull, and has an atmosphere of mayhem, chaos, and vicissitude. \nI don’t know why that is, and I don’t think they do too.\n\nThis piece depicts that liking of Collectors, that’s why we see ‘Collector’ uncontrollably looking at ‘Death’\n\nI usually do just blue, but I wanted to also draw your eyes to the shadows (P.s: my favorite part is ‘death’ looking back at ‘collector’).\n\nNext time you’re watching a Hollywood movie, notice the night scenes and how the lights: Blue and Orange are widely used.\nIt’s a color combo that gets the eyes intrigued!",
