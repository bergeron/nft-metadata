    "description": "I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone, itâ€™s not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people that make you feel all alone.\n\nThis capture represents the darkness and loneliness in this not so alone world. Its like everyone is right besides you yet no one is with you. In this world I have learnt that Loneliness only adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better.",
