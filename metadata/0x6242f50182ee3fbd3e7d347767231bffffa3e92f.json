    "description": "Yun Song A compares camels to modern individuals engaged in various tasks. The arid environment of the waterless desert can be seen as a metaphor for the urban life of modern people. The lack of time to take care of one's inner self, the need to keep up with rapidly changing trends, and the endless competitive society are representative characteristics of modern individuals in the 21st century. Yun Song A imagined a camel (representing modern individuals) dreaming in such a desert-like environment. Despite the harsh conditions, there is a hump on the camel's back that contains vitality. Carrying a water pouch on its back and closing its eyes, the camel sees rainbows, experiences love, and ventures into a fantastical world. These works, which emerged from such imagination, are part of the \"Dreaming Camel\" series and include \"Rainbow in the Desert,\" \"Loving Camel,\" and \"Fantasy World.\" Perhaps the camel's aspirations, which could also be seen as a self-portrait of the artist, evoke a warm resonance among people living in the modern world.",
