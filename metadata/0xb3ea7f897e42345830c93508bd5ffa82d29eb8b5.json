The voice of the desert speaks through the ornate glass, a voice that was once silent for centuries. But then the land was ruined by war and greed, and the desert took back what was rightfully hers. It is a voice that speaks of a time before the rise of civilization, of the eternal cycle of life and death and of the unspeakable things that dwell in the heart of the desert. It is a warning to turn back, to flee while there is still time.\n\nThe bottle is old and the message is faded, but the warning is still clear. If you value your life, do not venture into the desert.",
