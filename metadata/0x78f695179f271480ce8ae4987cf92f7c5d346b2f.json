    "name": "Into A Dream",
    "description": "A dream like dream is the result of exploration that has driven me further in my work. It is a personal work where I find new avenues in my art, eschewing symmetry and betting on composition as the main point. This is an instance in which I let myself go, allowed myself to do what I really wanted, and found that I could articulate what I thought and dreamed.\n\nI have brought out my inner world and tried to bring it to canvas. Since I was accepted into the Foundation, I knew that my origins had to be unique, as it was a special phase where I could begin the natural starting point of my career as a digital artist at a stage where I could grow faster.\n\nThe work is developed with great dedication and planning, with great emphasis on color and composition to make it perfect. I hope you enjoy it as much as I made it.",
