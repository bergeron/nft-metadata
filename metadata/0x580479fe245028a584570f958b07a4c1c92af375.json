    "description": "Aaron Aalto (b. 1992) \nIn Decision, 2022 \nPixels on JPG\n\nThis painting was inspired by Cicero and his declaration that \"More is lost by indecision than wrong decision.\" In the middle, is a human figure confronted by two different paths. The hints of red and yellow splattered on the figure symbolize the energy subtly but violently whirling within their conciousness.  \n",
