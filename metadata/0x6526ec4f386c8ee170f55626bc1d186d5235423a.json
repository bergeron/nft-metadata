Even if the city is tired, it is just beginning.  \nIt wants to have everything and hide everything.  \nBut even with a dim light, those who challenge it break through the night.\n\nPhotographer: Melih Taner Tanyeli  \nTitle: The Night Walk  \nEdition: Open  \nLocation: Istanbul-Turkey\n\nLicence: Extended Editorial  \nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
