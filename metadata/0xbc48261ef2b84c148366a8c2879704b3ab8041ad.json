    "description": "Surfers spend hour upon hour in the ocean searching for the perfect wave. The relentless pursuit of an otherworldly experience that is wave riding, in a beach break scenario this can easily turn into a whole lot of paddling, seeing a mirage of perfect waves, but only ever in the distance. The same parallel can be made in photography, This moment encapsulates so much about our chase, whist simply being a stunning emerald moment on a pristine winter afternoon, enjoyed by this surfer as he watches pure Indian ocean energy unfolding in front of him.
