    "description": "The moon is not a dream, a figment of the mind. It's not a trick of the eye, a fleeting illusion. It's a tangible force, a cosmic fusion. A gift, hanging in the sky.\n\nReflecting the unique insights and observations of a neurodivergent mind, my work is often referred to as \"Neurodivergent Aesthetics.\" \n\n",
