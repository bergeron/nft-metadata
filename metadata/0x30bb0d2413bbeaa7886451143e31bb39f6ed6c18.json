    "description": "Gulaab ka Sehra ( Headdress of Roses ) from the chapters of Her Legacy\n\n\"A legacy shared, and a legacy told\"\n\nItâ€™s about a time when a piece of cloth defined an emotion, an emotion that was shared ahead in the fragments of memories. \n\nIt's a part of life that defines our present while we preserve those fragments in the materialistic item that will someday become a legacy of our existence. \n\nSuch a legacy is shared by a mother, as she reminisces the day of her marriage while talking to her daughter. The mother shared a legacy with her in words, telling her about a time like a chapter of an old book. The mother whispers about her innocence, and the red she wore that defined her soul. She talks about that red as a symbol of our heritage, and as a red that became her legacy. \n\nHer legacy is a word of an emotion she felt, defined by a bond shared as a memory covered in red roses of time. It is a part of their lives that makes you believe when they shared an emotional bridge of time.",
