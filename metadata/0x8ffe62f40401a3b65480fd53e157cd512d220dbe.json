    "description": "A Yellow Moon aka Harvest moon is the symbol of purity, adaptation, happiness, longevity, positivity and letting go.  They are typically seen during the autumnal equinox which varies by time zone and location. \nFor several evenings during autumn, the moonrise comes shortly after sunset. This results in an abundance of bright moonlight early in the evening, which was a traditional aide to farmers and crews harvesting their summer-grown crops. \n\nTitle: Yellow Moon  \nEdition: 1/1  \nArtist: Sarah Lyndsay  \nLicense: Extended Editorial\n\nHow do I take these self-portraits?\n\nThey are a combination of 2 images. I take one shot of the overall scene which is typically a long exposure shot to smooth out any water and clouds in the sky. I then take a second shot of myself as the subject and combine them together in photoshop. Since I am often adding a long exposure technique to my images, I can't pose for more than a few seconds without visible movement in my hair or dress. I use a remote on my phone that connects to my camera to take the photo.\n\nAbout the artist - Sarah is a passionate environmental self-portrait and landscape photographer. Based in the beautiful Canadian Rockies, she is widely known for her signature yellow dress, long exposure work and bubbly personality.\n\nExtended Editorial License - Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
