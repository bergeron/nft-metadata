    "description": "Iran is entering its fourth month of daily nationwide demonstrations and strikes.  \n\"Woman Life Freedom\" slogan is being chanted all around the world for the support of Iranians and now it has become the first women led revolution against a brutal regime in Iran. \n\nThe Iranian regime is using violence against its own citizens so many people have been arrested, killed, tortured and many families are struggling.\n\nI created this artwork after the death of 22-years old kurdish girl \"Mahsa Amini\" to bring more focus and attention on the situation in Iran and amplify their voices.\n\nI will use 50% of sales as funds to support people of Iran's region of Kurdistan who are struggling because of lack of medicine and treatment. \n\nThere will be no possibility of transparency on where exactly the funds will be sent, as this will put the recipients in grave danger.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nWoman, Life, Freedom",
