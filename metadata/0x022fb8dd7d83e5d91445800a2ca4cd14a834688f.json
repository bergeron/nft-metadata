    "description": "Sometimes, even though we look at the world very carefully, we cannot see everything clearly. Because as the Little Prince said; the yeast of truth is invisible to the eye. Sometimes we have to look at the world not only with our eyes, but also with our hearts. I took the photos in this collection for this purpose. I wanted to show with my own eyes what is hidden behind the visible, not the visible.\nSwan Lake Ballet - From Ukraine",
