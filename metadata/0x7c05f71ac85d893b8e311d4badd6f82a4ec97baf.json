    "description": "In a world where citizens are separated into three distinct social classes, you are Machina, a dweller of the first and lowest floor. In this space, you are joined by artists, performers, and creators who are seeking to express their truest self. This stratum of living is unforgiving, but it is also the most freeing. Machina abhor the politics of the top floor rulers, they also shun the pleasure-driven corporate slaves of the middle class, choosing to instead live outside the system in their own way. Why trust a system that failed you when you can build your own? Are you ready? The Underground awaits, there is only space for 7777 of us.",
