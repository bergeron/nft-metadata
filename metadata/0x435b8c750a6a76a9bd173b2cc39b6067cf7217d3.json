    "description": "You take off your evening dress,\nFacing against the wall\nAnd I see fresh scars \nOn a velvet-smooth soul.\nI want to cry from pain \nOr forget myself in a dream.\nI liked them so much, \nWhere are your wings?\n\nWhere are your wings, I liked so?\nWhere are your wings, I liked so?\n\nWe used to have time\nNow we have only duties\nTo prove that the soot is white.\nTo prove that the strong eat the cuties,\nWe've all lost something\nIn this crazy war\nBy the way, where are your wings,\nI liked so?\n\nWhere are your wings, I liked so?\nWhere are your wings, I liked so?\n\nI'm not asking how much money\nOr how many husbands you had.\nI see you are afraid of open windows\nThey are making you really mad. \nAnd if a fire starts tomorrow\nAnd the whole building will burn\nWe will die without your wings\nI liked so. \n\nFree translation from russian by author. \"Wings\" by Nautilus Pompilius\n\n2018, Maksim Toome ",
