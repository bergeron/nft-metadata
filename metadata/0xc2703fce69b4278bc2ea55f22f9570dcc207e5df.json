    "description": "01/03 is one photo in a larger series called \"Birthday Suit.\" The series acts as a study of form, light, and shadow. A commentary on humans in their most natural state; relaxed, and undressed.\n\n01/03 is a self portrait shot on a Mamiya RB67 in a controlled studio space. This project pushed me to explore not only technical aspects of shooting film with strobes, but also explore more intimate details of myself, my gender, my sexuality, and ultimately society's unattainable expectation for the human body.",
