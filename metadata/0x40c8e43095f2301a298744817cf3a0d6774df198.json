    "description": "A painting of once a developed city turned into a slum after a massive disaster. Life here is harsh, nowhere is safe. The sky is always cloudy since that day. \n\nOnce in a while, there will be some empty spots in the sky. \n\nIt's one of those times when the evening sun reaches the ground through those empty spots.",
