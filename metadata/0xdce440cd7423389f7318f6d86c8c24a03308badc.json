    "description": "No matter how hard the casting work is, there is always time for chitchat and opportunity for smoking cigarettes during short breaks. This man is lighting his cigarette with molten iron. The smoke of the cigarette is mixing with the dense smoke in the environment. \n\nAgain, there is always time for joking along with chatter during short breaks. With a cigarette, of course. I wonder how they could hear each other's voices despite all the machine noise. When I ask why they are smiling, they are told that there is a private secret between them and they cannot tell. But I guess it's about a girl and a love affair.\n\n5484x3656 px, 300 dpi, 16.8 Mb, Edition: 1/1\n",
