    "description": "We go by the name Levity, a Chicago based electronic trio known for happy music full of colorful synths, upbeat drums, and euphoric soundscapes all wrapped into one. Our goal is to bring back and innovate that 2014-2017 “future bass” sound that’s both easy to listen to/connect with, and slap live. \n\nParadise was our first ever original release back in 2020. Prior to that we had only done unofficial remix’s for Soundcloud. This song started as a remix using one of our friend’s (Kolla) vocal in our member John’s childhood bedroom in November of 2019. Maybe a month later we got asked by Electric Hawk Records (Up and coming record label focused on artists receiving 100% of royalties) if we had anything we could release with them for their upcoming compilation “Rebirth”. We sent them this song (at the time titled “With You remix”) and they loved it but needed it to be original and due a month later. After little luck of finding singers we took to twitter asking for recommendations and that’s how we found LINDZ, who wrote and recorded her vocals remotely! \n\n“The nostalgia of being at my childhood home with my family had me excited and happy which drove the inspiration for this song. The production for the verse really felt like a warm homecoming where you could let go of any problems and worries and bask in the joyous presence of being with the ones you loved. LINDZ took that feeling and nailed it by bringing that feeling to a warm summer day with someone you love.” - John Hauldren (1/3 of Levity)\n",
