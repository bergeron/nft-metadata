    "description": "Location // Manchester, U.K.\nDate // June 21st, 2022\nCamera // Canon 5D Mark 1v\nExposure // 1/200\nF-stop // f/7\n\nSome would say the commute is mundane but I feel differently about this underrated ritual.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the electric energy that buzzes around the city in the morning as people rush to their 9 to 5. \nI find comfort and purpose in the repetition. Watching the world wake up is one of life’s true gifts.\n\nThe commute is about time, time to relax, time to think, time to plan and time to understand.",
