    "description": "In olden times, Palestinians viewed the Mediterranean Sea as a means to pursue business, spread culture, and live life. Much has changed over the years, but to the man in this picture, and countless Palestinians like him, the Sea still represents the hope for better. While many hoped to sail the Mediterranean in search of a better life away from Palestine, it remains the same sea that will bring us back home.",
