    "description": "Throughout history the human species has tried to leave traces of its life through symbols in media such as: caves, paintings, sculptures or other plastic media but it is not until the XXI century where these traces in the timeline of human expression were reflected in different ways through digital technology and Bitcoin is proof of this.\r\n\r\nIf “cryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action” as Julian Assange quoted, then human expression could use that medium to leave its mark.Stamps, Ordinals or Tokens in Bitcoin play an important role in this movement as it is through these new implementations in Bitcoin that new forms of human expression are being generated although there is a Meme culture for the most part this is not limited to any type of symbolic expression within the network. While it is debated whether the use of NTFs is right or wrong within Bitcoin, what is a fact is that what is already stamped will be resistant to censorship because “the universe believes in cryptography”.",
