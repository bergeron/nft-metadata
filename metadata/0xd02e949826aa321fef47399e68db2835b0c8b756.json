License: Extended Editorial\n\nBreathe.  \nEverything is interconnected.  \nNature is the very thing that fills many lungs, and what gives us life both literally and poetically.  \nBeauty, fragility, life giving. This is a visual expression and love letter to the thing that gives many something to live for : Nature.  A love letter and reminder of our mortality and to not let go of the things we love most. Just as  as nature is constantly changing and evolving, so too is life. Both nature and breathing involve a sense of balance and harmony.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSara Boychuk is on a mission to show the beauty in the world and provide a sense of stillness to the wilderness.  \n",
