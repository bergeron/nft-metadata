    "description": "Red, green, and blue (RGB) use their magical powers to create a new world. They weave countless pixels and, based on RGB colors, endow the pixel world with brilliant colors and infinite possibilities.\nColors and pixels are the foundation of the pixel world. They are ambitious, perhaps loving peace, or yearning for chaos, but there is no doubt that when these pixels expand infinitely, they will form a brand new world under their control !\nThe Pixel World Chronicles will begin after the prologue, and the colorful pixel blocks gradually create a large, diverse world.",
