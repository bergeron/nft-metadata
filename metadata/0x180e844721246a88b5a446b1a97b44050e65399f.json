    "description": "50 Shades of Brick\n\nSo it all started from seeing others gifting pieces, and remembering to be nice sometimes. So I decided to go absolutely wild and experiment for once, making 50 Shades of Brick. Why 50 you may ask? Because my phone didn't allow for more than 50 images to be combined as a super saiyan GIF max supreme. So here you go, claim a gift for yourself, you deserve it but don't take more than one, come on don't be greedy, and also be a good boy for Santa Brick.",
