    "description": "THIS WORK IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHER CASSIA TABATINI AND LIGHTING DESIGNER EDSON LUCIANO, CREATING EXPERIMENTAL PORTRAITS TO CAPTURE EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS TRANSLATED INTO COLOUR AND MOVEMENT.\n\nTHIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT, BEGINNING IN MARCH 2022. WE HAVE  INVITED  FOR THIS PORTRAIT A BRAZILIAN ARTIST, MARIANA PALMA WHO HAS COLLABORATED, IN THE PAST,  IN ANOTHER BODY OF WORK WITH C. TABATINI.\n\nTHE RELATION BETWEEN THE SITTER AND THE ONES CAPTURING THE IMAGE IS  NOT NECESSARILY NEEDED, THERE IS A CONNECTION TO CREATE ALSO, FROM THE INVITATION TILL THE END OF THE PROCESS.  SO WE DISCUSS THE MOMENT OF THE PORTRAIT AND  THE RESULT OF EVERY IMAGE.\n",
