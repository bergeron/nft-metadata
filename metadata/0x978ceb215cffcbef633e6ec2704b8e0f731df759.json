    "description": "As I lay alone in the silence of the night, I hear my thoughts so loud it hurts. Fear of what the mind screams leads to weeks of painful, sleepless nights that drain my energy. Worry about the future and an Imposter syndrome arriving with painful memories from the past drives a person to great weakness.  \n“Thoughts” is a display of a person in such a vulnerable place; with a warm blanket for armour, and an attempt to survive endless nights hiding from screams and whispers that only they hear, while lying in the dusty mess of a dull life.",
