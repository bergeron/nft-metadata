    "description": "What I struggle to describe within me is in the metaphors of these charged photographs.\n\nIt’s not difficult to be a good person in Geneva. But it is far from simple. You feel like the ugly duckling among the noble swans.\n\nSwitzerland’s chosen color is red. Still everywhere I look is in turquoise: the lake, the sidewalks, the whole city. \nUnnerving.\n\nMy soul drifts from darkness to light, lightness to dark. Without feeling a moment of belonging, I’m in pieces.\n\n\nLocation: Geneva, Switzerland\n\nCreation Date: 2021\n\nImage Size: 8145 × 6098 Pixels\n",
