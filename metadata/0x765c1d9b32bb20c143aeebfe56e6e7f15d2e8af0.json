    "description": "It seems to me that one can become a sociologist (as well as an ecologist) only if one has the goal of becoming the best sociologist in the world (or at least being in the top 5 percent). For example, being an average programmer is not shameful and you will definitely find a job that will feed you, and being an average sociologist is definitely not working by profession, which means there was no reason to get a sociological education. But this is my opinion, maybe there are people who will convince me.",
