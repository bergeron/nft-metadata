    "description": "e9Art - Artificially Imagined (AI) beings \n.\n.\n.\ni aim the imaginary camera at the inside of my head and this is what the AI sees.\n\nthis collection of imaginary friends is just for fun and represents my muse (and AI) at play. \n\nthe beings are often whimsical, and perhaps reveal too much of the inner workings of my unconscious dreaming mind. they also reveal my love of speculative fiction, both fantasy and sci-fi.\n\ndigital art by e9Art using google colab notebooks and photoshop, June 2022\n",
