    "description": "'Isabel' is a name i've used to personify many different people into one person. This song goes over the topic of saving someone from themselves, knowing it's sometimes impossible. I've kept it short n sweet, trying to be as concise as possible. This song was made entirely on a loop pedal, and no computer generated effects were used in the making of it. I played this song as an experiment to see how far a loop pedal could go, and it grew into something more than I expected. I hope you enjoy, and make sure to call your mom.\n\nsee the making of isabel here: https://www.tiktok.com/@neverstopdash/video/7027148191518821637?lang=en&q=isabel%20contradash&t=1677531960907",
