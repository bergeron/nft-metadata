    "description": "Shinjuku is characterized for being a major commercial and administrative centre and it houses the administration center for the Tokyo Metropolis. In this area there is also a concentration of department stores, cinemas, restaurants, bars, electronic and camera shops and a large presence of international hotels.  The busiest train station in the world in terms of passengers is also located in this area.\n\nThis photo is from a trip to Tokyo in 2005, the careful composition is different from other photos I made during that trip, my interest in photography started with finding out what made this photo different from the others.  \n\nLocation:  Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.\nDate:  2005-06-07 / 2:30:19 PM\nShutter speed:  1/400 sec\nAperture:  f/10\nISO: 200\nFocal Length:  18 mm\nFocal Length 35mm:  27 mm\nCamera:  Nikon D70\n\nJPG - 3000 x 2008 px",
