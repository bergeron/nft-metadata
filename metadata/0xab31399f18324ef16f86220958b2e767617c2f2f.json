    "description": "There is always a power in the light that brightens up our mood and mind. After a long drive of 600kms from Porto to Toledo, I was really tired and exhausted but the urge of going out and clicking this city was still there.\n\n\n\nI drove up to this viewpoint and waited for the right moment, my eyes were shutting down, my legs were not supporting the weight of my own body but then something magical happened. The lights started turning on and some magical power entered into my mind and heart and I spent the next 2hrs shooting this beautiful town. I could feel the power in me and didn't stop at all to live this magical moment of light.\n\n\n\nI realized that all we need in life is a simple reason to live that magic & it's always around us. We just don't need to give up.",
