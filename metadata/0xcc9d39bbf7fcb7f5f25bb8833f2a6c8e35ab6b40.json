    "description": "Reasons is the next saga of my love music. Its an unreleased song that marks another transition from hyper focused music on living a bachelor life I found myself on a journey of inner and outer love. During this process we got my most recent EP “Wake Up” signaling it’s time to wake up to that love that has been in search. “Reasons” is standing up for myself through the music for the first time without being too aggressive or dismissive to my audience about the subject.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite records because of the upbeat tune that is carried through the production by OTP. This is my very first audio NFT as I’ve sold many of visual NFT’s in my past. This song very well could’ve been on my last EP, but I’m glad to share the new with Soundxyz.\n",
