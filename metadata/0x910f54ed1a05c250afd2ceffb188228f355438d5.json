    "description": "The first image from \"Mediterranean Diet\" series. It was shot and edited at home, in March 2020, the first week of the lockdown in Spain. \n\n\"We often think about how much diet affects our external image, not so many times about how it affects our insides. The food that we eat, how itâ€™s been modified, the pesticides and its origin create a situation in which, for some people, eating is sometimes a source of pleasure but also a source of pain. Mediterranean Diet is a visual essay about the relevance of food in our wellbeing (or not).\"",
