    "description": "The heroes of the works of Victor Ribas are only very unusual people. DJ Vad is a very unusual character who was needed by the artist as a consultant scientist. He worked at the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation as a physicist. But he also worked part-time as night dj-sets, because at the beginning of the 2000s, scientists in Russia received very little money. The precision technique of creating these works painstakingly captures the slightest emotions on a personâ€™s face and we can see how focused and deepened this person is, which is typical for a scientist, but not typical for a music DJ",
