    "description": "There are many ways to look at water.  What if water was billions of strings strung together and connected? The energy and space pulling along to be one thing. I am struck by how these falls divided the waters into fine strands. The theory of Everything  as ONE thing.  We all pull together to make one thing. ONE Community. Yet, we are all individuals. We need each other to pull together to create this beautiful world.",
