    "description": "Everyday is a new hope to me. Here I met the same guy like me. He also have the same hope for getting  fish.....\n\nI clicked this photograph from the coastal belt of Kerala's Thrissur district, locally known as Arappa near Snehatheeram beach. A transition zone between the river and sea, this forms an estuary during monsoon in Gods own country. The beam light in the frame  gives a uniqueness to the photograph....\n\nI have captured this image with limited gears, a base model camera (NIKON D3500) and 50MM lens.",
