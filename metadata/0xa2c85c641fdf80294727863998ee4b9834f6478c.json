    "description": "In January 2022, events occurred in Kazakhstan that will long be remembered by local residents. The riots killed 160 people and caused enormous damage to the city. Militants burned government buildings, seized fire trucks to ram security gates. Looters looted electronics stores, jewelry stores, and grocery supermarkets. For several days, city residents fell asleep and woke up to the sound of gunfire and grenade explosions. The city was shrouded in a thick, cold fog mixed with smoke, reflecting as much as possible the atmosphere prevailing in the city.\n\nAlmaty is my hometown, and I was a witness to everything that happened. In my work the fire engine in the hands of looters represents the city itself, which also happened to be a toy and a means in other people's dirty hands. \n\nThe Almaty tragedy collection will consist of 3 works and this is the first work of the series. \n\nIn the wrong hands. \n1600Ñ…2000 px",
