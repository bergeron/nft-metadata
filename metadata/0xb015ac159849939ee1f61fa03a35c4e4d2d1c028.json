    "description": "I have never felt so off the grid and isolated than during my time on Hirta. 40 miles from the Outer Hebrides, all you can see for miles around is the Atlantic Ocean and the scattering of islands that make up St Kilda. One of these, Boreray, is visible after hiking to ‘the Gap’, a precipice above the highest UK sea cliffs at over 400 metres. Carefully watching my step, this was the view I was treated to - Boreray and the two tallest sea stacks in the UK (Stac an Armin, 196m and Stac Lee, 172m). A lone boat off the east coast shows just how grand these monoliths are. \n\nThese remote stacks and island were sailed to annually by the Hirta residents, where they harvested birds as their main food source. A five mile sailing was treacherous with dangerous conditions and shabby boat designs - a smallpox outbreak on Hirta in 1727 meant three men and eight boys were marooned on Stac an Armin until the following May. What a life they used to live. \n\nA lone fulmar flies into view - history flashes before my eyes.",
