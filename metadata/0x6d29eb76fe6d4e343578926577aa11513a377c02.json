    "name": "Light Painting Portrait #1",
    "description": "Portraits in the style of light painting are created in complete darkness. The camera is located on a tripod . Usually for such photos I use the camera settings - Exposure 10sec, iso 100, F11. During the exposure, the model freezes for 10 seconds - and at that moment I illuminate her face with a flashlight and swipe next to and across the face with a light brush. One successful photo takes about 30 attempts and an hour of photographing.",
