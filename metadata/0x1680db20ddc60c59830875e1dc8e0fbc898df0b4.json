    "description": "Creating the final colored painting is the ultimate step in a long process that varies across artists. For Paul Reid, a black and white study serves as a cornerstone of his process. Unlike other artists who may use studies to focus on specific details, Paul's black and white study helps him work out crucial elements such as composition, tone, and gestures. He uses fast-drying acrylic paints for his studies to add texture to the underlying layers of a digital image. While not all of his works require a study, it is a crucial component of his creative process. \"The Minotaur â€“ Study\" is the first of Paul's studies ever to be released as an NFT.",
