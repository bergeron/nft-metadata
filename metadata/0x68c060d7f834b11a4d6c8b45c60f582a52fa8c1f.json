    "description": "The work consists of dozens of layers that have been deconstructed: music instruments, human figures, architectural types, characters and texts. Together they blend past, present and future, reality and imagination, life and death and create surrealistic scenes that provide the viewer with various points of views, simultaneously. The animation creates minimalist movements, counterclockwise circular narratives, that offer new ways of observation.",
