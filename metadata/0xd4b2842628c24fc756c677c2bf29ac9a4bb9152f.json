    "name": "Lying Nude",
    "description": "In ideological societies where the display of nude images and the human body are prohibited within the scope of art, the process of creating artworks is accompanied by challenges and, perhaps more importantly, art education becomes impossible. The purpose of this series of artworks are studying the \"subject\" of art.  A subject that ways of dealing with it (its presence or its removal) has been one of the factors in the formation of artistic types and styles in different periods of art history. The nude image is both an educational tool and has an aesthetic aspect, placed in its own rhetorical category. On the other hand, when it is produced according to a particular taste, it becomes a consumer product.\n\nIn these set of drawings, only the nudity of the body is my subject, not just aesthetically but the human form, her prescence. All my efforts were to depict as I see and understand and flow from my feelings.\n\nThe agency of the body completely precedes other propositions of importannce.",
