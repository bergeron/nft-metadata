    "description": "A collaborative work with Rik Oostenbroek's iconic piece called 'Self'. #ShowYourself\n\n'Hex' is inspired by one of my most terrifying lucid-dream episodes. It symbolizes parts of human nature, the irresistible pressure to give in to a dark desire.\n\nThe process : \n- Every segment on ‘self’ provided by Rik was hand-sculpted using non-dry clays.\n\n- Negative spaces were filled with pieces of coir mats, bits of cardboard box, chunks of tree barks, different kind of fabrics, crumpled aluminium foil, grass mat, screws, candles, lightbulbs and crystal beads with some acrylic paint touch ups.\n\n- Plasma bulb was made by 2 car ignition coils in parallel. Driven by a light dimmer. Both coils were immersed in engine oil to minimize plasma leakage. Output wires were connected to the lightbulb and one of the screws. The electric arc seen was around 40-50k volt. \n\n#showyourself #rikoostenbroek #aoi #self",
