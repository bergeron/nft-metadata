    "description": "He is a high-ranking member of the Salamanca drug cartel and is portrayed as a ruthless and cunning individual. Hector is also known as \"Tio,\" which means \"uncle\" in Spanish. He is wheelchair-bound and relies on a bell to communicate, due to a stroke he suffered as a result of the stress caused by his criminal activities. Hector is shown to be a major adversary of the show's protagonist, Walter White, and is responsible for much of the violence and chaos that occurs throughout the series. Despite his cold and calculating nature, Hector is also depicted as having a strong sense of loyalty to his family and his cartel.",
