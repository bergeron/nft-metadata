    "description": "\nMost of the images of human in the Achaemenid period are similar and in the form of an ideal man. The bored ape with devotion to Cyrus the Great and in order to get out of boredom, has gone into the form of an idealistic man in Persepolis, but his poker-faced is still recognizable! ðŸ˜‰\nIn this piece, I turned one of the bas-relief of the Achaemenid soldier into a bored ape.\n",
