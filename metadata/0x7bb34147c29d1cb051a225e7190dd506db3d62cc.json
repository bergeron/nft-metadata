    "description": "The human race has always wanted to know what is hidden behind the clouds. What are the mysteries hidden by sunset and dawn, the Sun and the Moon, constellations and passing comets? The peoples believed in different Gods and their unimaginable power. They prayed to mythical creatures, made tenders to them and believed in their power over peopleâ€™s lives. Philosophers, writers and painters created images of immortal pilgrims who lived in clouds and sometimes descended to our earth to mingle with the crowd and enter our lives.\nDepending on the century, the illusive creatures changed their appearance. My Gods are bionic androids keeping a close eye on little humans on the Earth. They speechlessly watch over the balance in the Universe; they are just guardians who do not judge or punish. They have great strength and mercy in their hands to understand and forgive each of us...\n",
