    "description": "In the forest along the East Coast Trail in Newfoundland (CAN), I drew trees repetitively using charcoal, accumulating a series of observational drawings. They are then animated using stop-motion techniques. The result: short animation loops of these dancing trees.\n\nI like to observe the base of the trees, the fixed or imperceptible movement by which they take root in the ground. Sometimes sinuous and crisscrossing, sometimes straight and solemn, I imagine these trees as dancers taking root in the forest floor, slowly moved with the elements.  This series seeks to draw attention to the individuality of the beings that populate our forests through a playful and poetic outlook.",
