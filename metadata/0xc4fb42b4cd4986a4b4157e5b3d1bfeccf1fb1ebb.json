    "description": "This work corresponds to the Ego. In psychology, the Ego is the psychic instance that manages the interests of the person, it is rational. \nThis work shows the constant pressure that the human being undergoes from the system that he has created. The earth represents society and all the individuals that make it up. The heart torn out refers to the fact that this world is normative, shapes us, smoothes us, because if we do not meet certain criteria, we are put on the fringe of this society. Denying ourselves has thus become a vital need. To the detriment of our passions, our desires, our dreams, of what we really are. This work shows the artist who fights to live from his art, who does not want to be sucked into the system. It is a testimony of the psychological and physical servitude that strikes the human being in his hypermodernity. But, what are the repercussions of this on the human being?",
