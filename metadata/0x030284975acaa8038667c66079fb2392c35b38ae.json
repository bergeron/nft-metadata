    "description": "This is song 2 from CACOPHONY, a new project from Reo Cragun and myself. CACOPHONY is a beautiful explosion. Deafeningly loud and chaotic and intimate at the same time. \n\nFROM REO:\nThe jig is up is honestly about reading through the facade and people’s BS. \n\nThe road of an independent artist can be extremely difficult at first, but if you put in the work it can prove to be really rewarding. Fortunately now I’m in a position where I don’t have to jump at a major label deal anymore and have the means to comfortably support myself. Oddly enough it’s at that point when a lot of people come knocking to partner. \n\nWe were really just having fun with this record and reflecting on the level we’ve gotten to based off hard work and staying consistent.\n\nFROM CLEAR EYES:\n\nHaving fun was so key with this one. Reo and I make a lot of heavy shit together (like the first single from CACOPHONY, HEAVEN) but it’s important to balance that with music that makes you feel good, makes you feel powerful. We love Kevin George’s energy and adding a feature just added to the excellent vibes.",
