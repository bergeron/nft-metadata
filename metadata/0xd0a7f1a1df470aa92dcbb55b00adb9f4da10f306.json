    "description": "This shot definitely has some story to tell. This was my second time visiting San Francisco and I didn't want to leave until I was able to visit Marshall's Beach. I tried 3 times to find this beach on my trip with no luck until the last day I finally got the hike trail on the map that takes you down there. The hike was ok to go down but to go up it definitely hit me hard. I even got all my boots wet trying to get the perfect shot. In the end I took home the photo that I always wanted to have and one of the best experiences.",
