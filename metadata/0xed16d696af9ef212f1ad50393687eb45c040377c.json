    "description": "When is a time you have accomplished something beyond your imagination? Or pushed yourself a little further than your preconceived belief?\n\nYou are capable against all odds.\n\nThis image came on a night of -35C.  As the time passed midnight, everyone drove home as the aurora was faint in appearance.  I had it in my gut to stay, even if it meant breaks in the car to warm up. I just had a feeling she was trying to come out this night.  \n\nSeemingly against all odds, we got an awe-inspiring show at 02:00am.\n\nThis is NOT a composite. My partner and I took our tent and weighed in down in the middle of a frozen lake and photographed it while trying not to think of the cold.  The aurora is particularly difficult down here and it truly isnâ€™t all that common to see. A balance of science and magic reveal this  sought after phenomenon.  \n\n\nIncluded: Digital ownership |Extended Editorial Licensing | Physical Print upon request |  Donation in your name | Aurora information and teachings upon request\n",
