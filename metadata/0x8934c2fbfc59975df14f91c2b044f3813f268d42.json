    "description": "Tigers are often looked as being one of the most beautiful yet ferocious animals and perhaps this is a sole driving factor that makes them even more interesting creatures. But sadly, they have come to a verge of being categorized as endangered, thanks to the human sloppiness and prudence. As a wildlife lover with keen interest on large cats, I enjoy visiting wildlife sanctuaries but the question remains, how well do I or we know about this exotic animal? Weâ€™re often clouded by many misconceptions with other large cat species.\nOne of the most common knowledge to any wildlife lovers, wild animals enjoy a surprise kill but not as much as Tigers. Due to their stripe camouflage, they hide behind thick bushes and attack their victim from behind. It is also said that Tigers are less likely to attack when we see them.",
