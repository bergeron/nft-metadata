    "description": "\"Through perseverance we shall overcome.\" - Sir Ernest Shackelton\n\nI think about the story whenever I feel overwhelmed. The true story of the explorer Shackelton and the 27 men that sailed on the 'Endurance' for the Antarctic on an expedition in 1914. the goal was to cross the Antarctic. Unfortunately the ship got stuck and eventually sank November 21st, 1915 leaving all 28 men on the ice with only what they could salvage and drag over the ice.\nAll men were rescued in 1916. Everyone survived.\n\nArtist: Annemarije de Boer\nCamera: Canon EOS 5DS\nLocation: Venice Beach, California\nDate: December 17th, 2022\nISO: 200\nF-Stop: F/22\nExposure: 1/4s\nLens: 28mm",
