    "description": "This 1/1 artwork, named Continuum X belongs to the Strandium series. This artwork embodies the motion of life throughout our choices. The choices and decisions that we make are like pathways to a destination. The countless variations of our choices governed by emotion and biases give us direction and perhaps influence our goals. \n\nWe become the product of the environment, and the environment becomes our extension. Continuum X refers to the environment that became the extension of our choices. ",
