    "description": "This will be our first song that we are putting out to the world together, the first release Scorch produced and first song Iâ€™ve comped my own vocals. I am super excited to continue to work on this song and see where the final version finds itself :) \nThis grant money would help us finish up the huge amount of songs we have started and help us build out our catalog, both together and separately as artists. We hope you enjoy this love song that captures the vulnerability of a relationship from highs to lows, doubts, memories, reassurance etc.",
