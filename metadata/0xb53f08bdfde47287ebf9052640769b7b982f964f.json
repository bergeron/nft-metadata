    "description": "The works perform algorithmic-guided, post-cinematographic navigations and temporal autopsies across a forensic-grade spatial model. They sample four billion attributes, indexing particle-scale surface and spectral signatures of Hurricane Katrina, across New Orleans’ inundated suburbs. The artist’s methodological arc involves both field work and learning algorithms and design informatics to patch 800 gigabytes of raw data, from multiple remote sensing sources, into a statistical model. Remote sensing’s light detection and ranging science (a time-stamped emission of pulsed photons and electromagnetic radiation) create high-resolution digital doppelgängers. The model samples “toxic gumbo,” a local term to describe flood waters: an estimated two million cubic yards of demolition debris, micro-pollutants, dust particles, and mold spores forensic precision, with up to +/- 0.1 µm accuracy. The animations reveal a gaseous architecture to the city’s suburbs, its extinction episodes.",
