    "description": "I was born on Balkans, in the mouth of civil war.\nThree nations in a small area of land unleashed a bloodbath in the name of their flag and the right to call themselves by their nation's name.\nI was a young child and don't remember those events.\nI learned about them later from my mother.\n\nBut what I do remember are the endless bloody conflicts between groups of people killing each other because \"they\" aren't \"us\". The world is doomed to wars if there's at least two nationalists.\n\nThe less we control our own consciousness, the more we entrust it to symbolism, to ideology, to belonging to a separate, \"special\" group - the faster we become a tool in the political struggle of others.\n\nNationalism is what divides people, not unites.\nI hope one time we'll be together. Because we are.\nI know it.",
