    "name": "The Element of Ether",
    "description": "The Element of Ether is the subtlest of all. It denotes the highest matter - the spirit.  \nIt is something invisible, but encompasses and pervades all. In Alchemy Ether is contrasted with the other elements.  The elements of Fire, Water, Earth and Air are independent in nature. And Ether influences them all. It affects matter.\n Everything we put our heart and soul into gains strength.  The dreams that come from our heart materialize and become part of reality.\nThe woman is very serene, totally calm and open. The starry sky and the cosmic nebula surrounding her reflect infinity. Her loose hair and tilted head symbolize the flow state, when the body moves, and the mind and consciousness follow, with no resistance. \nShe is treading lightly, her arms spread out - this is the dance of life. The element of Ether is depicted on the piece of cloth which is covering her shoulders. Everything that we put on our shoulders we choose consciously.\nFill any idea with Ether, and it will obtain a soul.",
