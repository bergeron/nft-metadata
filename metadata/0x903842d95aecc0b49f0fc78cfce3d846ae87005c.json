    "description": "We inhabit disparate worlds of thoughts. As we adopt an ascetic life of living in our heads. Sometimes it's the only way to escape. We would love to have everyone on our side but sometimes that doesnâ€™t happen. What we do is misguide others without having the intention to even do so. \nLife itself is something extraordinary which we actually can control when it's based on what we feel and everything around us, but it's easier to detach from yourself than to connect to your inner self. \nLove. Hate. Sorrow",
