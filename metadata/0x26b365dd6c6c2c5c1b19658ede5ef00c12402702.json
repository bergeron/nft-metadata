    "description": "3LAU’s Ultraviolet Vinyl Collection celebrates the 3 year anniversary of his debut album released in 2018, garnering over 100 million streams to date. The album captured the inevitable loneliness of digitally-driven social relationships and the original artwork was designed by 3LAU’s longtime creative collaborator Slimesunday. Slimesunday uses editing techniques like pixel-sorting to represent this theme visually, capturing emotional decay, and the struggle to find balance between digital and analogue worlds. A feeling that’s especially relevant in 2021.",
