    "description": "I compare Istanbul to this two-headed crow. A wise crow, one side in europe but its real essence and body in asia.\n\nI am an Istanbul photographer. These streets are my studio and my material. Therefore, every single work of mine revolves around and relates to Istanbul. As I walk the streets of this city, I find myself choosing between old and new, beautiful or ugly, love and hate. I take pictures using only my muscle memory and index finger and not fearing my mistakes and accidents, in fact learning from them.",
