    "description": "\"Bipolarity\" is the first art work in the \"Exfoliations\" collection. Despite the fact that the name refers us to something dual, we should not forget that in this company there is always a third. The one who experiences it all. That is why I decided to make \"Bipolarity\" part of my glitch triptych.\nAbstract paintings drawn with real paints were taken as a basis for this work and converted to 3D model. \nThis setup was then placed in a real-time graphical environment in order to distort it with GLSL code.",
