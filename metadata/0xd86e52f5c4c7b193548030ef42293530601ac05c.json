    "description": "Holger Lippmann has been creating code-based art since the 1990s.\n10sec2flw-X charity is an one file open edition and an extension of the unique collectible series of 10sec2flow. The extension was created to alleviate the hunger waves of kids in Syria, triggered by the force of nature.\nFascinated by space, depth, rhythm, beauty, the topic of „landscapes“ is a constant companion of his artistic work. Especially this gentle swinging into each other, soft rolling hills, followed by billowing cloud banks, this kind of loving frequency, became one of his most-worked-on topics of the last 10 years or so…“\n\nFor every NFT sold, Alphafounders donates 30 meals for people in Syria via the UN World Food Programme. In cooperation with the curated V-IRL art platform xcircle and the breakout artist Holger Lippmann we have organized this unique fundraiser to support families in Syria.
