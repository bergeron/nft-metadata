    "description": "The Great Train Robbery is a remake of the classical story of the wild-wild west and the timeless stories that encapsulate us.  Today, the wild-wild west of a new system of money (crypto) that gives power back to the individuals.  Some say that Bitcoin was created  in response from the bank mortgage crisis of 2008, others say it was a technological evolution .  Anyway you look at it now, it's us who are the bank robbers.  Bandits stealing back our intellectual property, our value and making a stand.   It's the great heist of the 22nd century.  \n\nOriginal Token Oct-26-2021 \n/tx/0x3d96d0bf43bd8ad1c2b03580b679d317c2cba3c357d31ca9032ba9d4c9bfaf97 Original token burned,\nUpdated and reborn (legacy details) https://etherscan.io/nft/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/29828\n",
