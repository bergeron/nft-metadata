    "description": "Athens was one of the most important cities in Ancient Greece. There was a famous school here, especially for young students who wanted to join the academy. This school was founded by Plato, one of the greatest philosophers in history.\n\nStudents admitted to the school were subjected to a strict program of discipline and study to learn Plato's philosophy. Plato gave his students many lessons to help them understand the true nature of the universe and its meaning in people's lives. The students listened attentively to these lectures and were fascinated by Plato's philosophy.",
