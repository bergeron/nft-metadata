    "description": "original multilingual poetry on digital art.\n\nthe first stanza of the poem was written in collab with ChatGPT, to make this piece a pragmatical ode to AI and its possibilities. ChatGPT was told how to write a multilingual poem and trained during the conversation to work with my style.\nthe following verses are written by me.\n\nthe image was created using the generative AI model stablediffusion2. \nonce given an original text prompt, the output was not edited or manipulated in any way after it was generated, resulting in a raw and unfiltered expression of the model's output and my inner worlds. \n\nall in all, it is an artwork about flowing, about serendipity, about embracing life in all possible ways!",
