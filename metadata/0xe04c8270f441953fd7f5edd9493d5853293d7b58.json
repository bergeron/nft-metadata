    "description": "It's hard to open my inner doors by myself. It seems impossible to open someone else's. I'm meaningless by myself... . The only problem is  the puzzle I belong to. Was this a life, or a love? I couldn't know... . Whenever my soul would seem to understand things, my mind would punish it immediately... . That was the reason why the human soul was like a prisoner who would escape from the cells of their mind. Our ego is imprisoned inside... . And one they our mind guardian will shoot our escaped soul. That's how a soul dies.",
