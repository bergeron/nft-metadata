    "description": "The very first artwork of a series exploring values and the role of personality in the NFT world.\n\nLike a genesis block in blockchain this work describes the main principles of the experiment and starts a chain:\n\n• In each work, the artist writes down the name (or a shortened wallet address) of the person who bought the previous one from the collection. This forms the name chain that always continues.\n• The price always starts at 0.1 eth.\n• The way of writing is always different.",
