    "description": "this is small town.  my town.  brisbane.  small town # 1 depicts the major flooding event in brisbane at the end of february 2022. traffic lights and roads signs sit half submerged as the river swallows up cars, homes, lives. i started with a photograph of flooding in the area of beaudesert and passed through a generative model to create a digital canvas to work on.  i then transferred the canvas to procreate where i worked on texture and colours, adding layers, and aiming for a digital impasto effect to create the finished piece",
