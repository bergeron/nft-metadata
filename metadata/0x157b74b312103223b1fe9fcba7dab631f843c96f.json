    "description": "Ω is a standalone work of art & project that represents 10 years of Gabriel's artistic life. Ownership of Ω yields a bonus air dropped NFT every month on the first day of the month consecutively until the full 10 year period is complete. Whoever possesses Ω will accrue 120 original 1 of 1 works over the course of 10 years in addition to Ω itself.\n\nΩ includes luxury perks and global acts of goodwill. These perks include a custom GDR designed Rolls Royce Ghost, an annual celebration, A home for Ω and its subsequent art displayed through AR at the Louvre grounds, 1 million trees planted, 1 million dollars to doctors without borders.\n\nΩ stands alone in its audacity and scope of meaning, bridging performance art with ultra-luxury and an artist-patron relationship unseen since the last renaissance.\n\nPerk 1: Airdrop schedule. 1 unique work of Gabriel’s choosing will be airdropped on the first of every consecutive month for ten years to the wallet address Ω was purchased from.\n\n*Owner of Ω agrees if ever reselling Ω to sell for a price higher than the highest market value NFT purchase at that time. If owner sells Ω for less than the last highest public NFT sale, monthly airdrops will be voided permanently.\n\n*If Ω is resold, the remaining months of airdropped new works will pass to the new owner.\n\n*Gabriel can and will produce other works and projects as he sees fit. These works are not associated with this performance and production of monthly drops relating to Ω. \n\n*If for any reason, Gabriel is incapable or unable to deliver new art, the remaining balance of art will be resumed once his ability to create new work is possible. If permanently unable to create new work, the remainder of Gabriel’s unpublished art will be given to the owner of Ω to the amount of up to 120 pieces.\n\nPerk 2: Custom GDR design Rolls Royce Ghost.  Within one year of purchase of Ω, Gabriel will deliver his custom designed Rolls Royce Ghost to any physical address of the owner’s choosing. \n\nPerk 3: AR property at the Louvre grounds. Gabriel will place Ω on his Augmented Reality property on the Louvre grounds and give the property to the owner of Ω after placement\n\nPerk 4: Annual Party. Gabriel will host an annual party at the place of his choosing on or near the anniversary of the purchase of Ω.\n\nPerk 5: Gabriel will pay for the planting of one million trees in the name of the owner of Ω.\n\n Perk 6: Gabriel will donate one million US dollars to Doctors Without Borders within the first year of the purchase of Ω\n\n*Ω is the name and symbol of the Ω NFT and the Ω project. \n\n*Ω is not affiliated with any other brand or product and is the sole creation of Gabriel Dean Roberts named after the last letter in the greek alphabet for its cultural and historical significance.",
