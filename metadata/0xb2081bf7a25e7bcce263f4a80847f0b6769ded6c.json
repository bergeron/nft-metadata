    "description": "Ape-kun's World is a collection of works featuring a lovely monkey character called Ape-kun, created by @Tenjin, one of Japan's leading digital artists. In this exhibition, there are 500 limited works, and Apekun's loveliness and mischief are depicted in detail. The vivid colors and bold images known as Hidetaka Tenjin's style are still alive in this exhibition. And the works that are carefully drawn in detail, such as Apekun's facial expressions and gestures, will surely fascinate the viewer."
