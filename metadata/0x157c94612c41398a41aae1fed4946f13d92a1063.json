    "description": "I will keep in mind your visage - frozen for a moment in hopelessness,\nIndifferent to you - because of your passing tenderness,\nof your loneliness, of your blind single-mindedness,\nof your confusion, of your silent youth.\n\nAll that you overtake, suspend, bring by,\nEverything that has been and is, everything that you will persecute,\nby night, by day, by winter, by summer, by spring\nAnd in the autumn fields, everything remains with me.\n\n(J.Brodsky, from \"The Letter to A.D.\")",
