    "description": "In January 2023 BasedAF dropped its NFT project:  \nBasedHeads (0x42dc0cecefbaf8e81d631a75fa212510c347f66b) \n\nThe project hinges around 'open source' brands with which the web3 community can create their own virtual and physical products.  Our original intention was trademark each of the names in order to protect people from trolls trademarking them retrospectively and issuing people with cease and desists.  Sadly,  trademarking traditionally relies on the trademark holder granting specific rights to licensees and actively protecting the trademark by legally pursuing anybody that uses the brand name without express permission.  This is not how open source works.\n\nThe NFT has been minted to establish prior art and underline that this brand is open for use by anybody wanting to create a virtual or physical drinks based product with it and that BasedAF has no control over or responsibility for the quality of the products created using these brands. \n\nAt this point the brand has been used to create drinks that appeared at NFT TALLIN and NFC LISBON.  There is also a timestamp of its inception and place in the bigger BasedHeads lore with the creation of the following token:\n\n0x42dc0cecefbaf8e81d631a75fa212510c347f66b:8364  \nJohnny Fraz Jnr II",
