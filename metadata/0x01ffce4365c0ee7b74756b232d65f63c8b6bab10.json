    "description": "ORANGUTAN\n\nby Brad Wilson\n\nEdition 1/1\n\n6000 x 6000 px\n\nThe orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) is a species of great ape found in the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.\n\n2022 IUCN conservation status: Critically endangered\n\nThese in-studio, high-resolution photographs show the rarest moment captured with each animal–the direct frontal gaze–something that happened for only a few seconds over the course of many hours. This fleeting eye contact offers a powerful sense of intimacy, connection and authentic encounter–an experience not normally possible in the wild, or even in captive settings. \n\nThe images have been featured by Audubon, World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, Microsoft and Apple. The work has been widely exhibited and sold in the US, Europe and Asia, and is in numerous private and institutional collections.\n\nA signed copy of my book, “THE OTHER WORLD,” will be included with each sale.",
