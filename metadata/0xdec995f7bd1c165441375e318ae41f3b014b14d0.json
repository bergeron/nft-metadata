    "description": "The Hungry Hamster is a representation of greed we see in everyday artists and its ecosystem. Each of them has a story to be told and holds on to a half-eaten ‘munchie’, giving a hint of the little desires they so wish for.\n\n Releasing as both a digital and physical collectible, Hungry Hamster Club (HHC) hopes to have their works available at major marketplaces and retail stores.\n\n In time, HHC hopes to collaborate with more artists to hold amazing exhibitions, as well as help younger creators with funding and incubation.\n\n https://hungryhamster.club",
