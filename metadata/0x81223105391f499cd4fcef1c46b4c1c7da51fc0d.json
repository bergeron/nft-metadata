    "description": "Our brain is an ocean of thoughts, and these thoughts drives our life into directions. People say that these thoughts are the free spirits swimming in the ocean of our brain just like fishes. There are good ones and the bad ones. Some swim at the top of the sea, while some are deep inside our Brain Ocean. Some die sooner while some are like jellyfish. Its us, our brain, who's writing the script of life for these spirits. We decide our own faith by deciding these Thoughts Spirits in our Brain ocean.",
