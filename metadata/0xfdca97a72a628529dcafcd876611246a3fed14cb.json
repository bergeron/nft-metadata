    "description": "\"My name is Ellie Douglass  \nor L.E.D. as my friends call me. \n(Ellie D = LED get it?  )  \nIâ€™m a 16 year old, NYC high school junior  \nAnd this is the story of how I came to rule the world.\"\n\nSTORY:  \nThis is section 1a of codeGirl  \n(An interactive graphic novel I wrote for the Tribeca Film Festival).\n\nCODE:  \nYou can Rotate & Zoom to change the point of view  \nwith any IO: mouse | trackpad | touchscreen | controllers. \n\nI put this story into my design systems for the blockchain, which I call StoryBlox & FlipBooks.  \nThese are spatial and responsive narrative systems I build that move back and forth between screens / XR & future holographic displays.  \nThese stand-alone storyBlox also link together to create the larger narrative.  \nFurther, this work can change and update over time, allowing the story, how it looks and functions to grow & evolve as well.\n\nDESIGN:  \nI have built most of these assets by hand in VR.",
