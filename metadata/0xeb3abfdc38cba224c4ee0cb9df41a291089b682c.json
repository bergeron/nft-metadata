    "description": "In the month of April, almost every year the gallenos carry a garden child on their backs. They go down the Guaniguanico mountain range and walk from the north to the caves of Santo Tom치s.\nIt is important that the children smile throughout the journey, which is why the Utom치 tribe accompanies the Gallenos while they dance and tell incredible stories about the people of the sea.\nOver the wrinkled-nosed leaves the watering booby sings, keeping the pot alive and hydrated.\n\nMaraquelles flutter in their cold reptile skins near some Utom치 as they take a break from the long journey. They say that in the caves of Santo Tom치s the blue color is breathed and they also say that children can grow up outside the pot.",
