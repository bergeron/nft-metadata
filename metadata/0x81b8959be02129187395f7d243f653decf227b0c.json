    "name": "Napoleon in Moscow",
    "description": "This unique photograph was taken on the territory of the Moscow Kremlin several years ago. There were no tourists in the Kremlin that day, and I managed to get there with a special media pass. By a happy coincidence, on this day, a historical film about the war with Napoleon in 1812 was filmed on the territory of the Kremlin. My attention was drawn to two actors who took photos on the phone next to the Tsar Cannon - they were Napoleon and an officer of the French army.\nAccording to history, Napoleon captured Moscow in the autumn of 1812, destroying the entire arsenal of the Kremlin, but the Tsar Cannon was not damaged.",
