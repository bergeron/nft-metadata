    "description": "-FULMINATE is an open edition by Gregory Berg. Thank you for being here. \n-The mint price is 0.03420 ETH  \n-Three mints max per wallet  \n-Burn one edition of ‘FULMINATE’ to redeem one ‘IN HALF’ (yet to be revealed)\n\nA cold winter's day spent on the waterfront chasing a dream frame. This photograph is not a composite. Really good timing mixed with a tiny bit of luck helped me to make one of the most viral and unique images of my career to date, FULMINATE. I have tried countless times to get this exact frame, heading out into many storms over the years and never had success. Such long evenings spent shooting thousands of images, but never getting the timing perfect or the lightning bolt bright enough. Lighting hitting the Freedom Tower doesn’t happen too often, and a good storm in New York City is rare in itself. \n\nThere will be a burn mechanic released in a couple of days, you will be eligible to burn 'FULMINATE' and receive a new, never before seen frame of downtown Manhattan titled 'IN HALF'. \n\nDo not send any editions to a burn address, please use the Manifold burn page which will be placed here in a couple of days in order to receive ‘IN HALF’.\n\nIf you have any questions at all, or just want to say hi which I totally welcome, feel free to DM me on twitter @gbergphoto \n",
