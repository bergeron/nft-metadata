My goal with these paintings is to create the beauty of peace and friendship, a world without war is a more beautiful world.\nNothing in this world is worth war, 2000 years from now we will not all exist, but history will exist, so let's make a more beautiful history.\nThis painting is a representation of peace between Iran & USA",
