    "description": "For the JEVELS launch, I have extracted embellishment from one of my favorite past works. The look was initially inspired by the costumes of the Edwardian era, which I thought would be interesting to mix with futuristic elements.  \nThe embellishment is not only paying tribute to the pearl necklaces of the romantic past but also referencing the galaxy with its dynamically arranged spheres, floating with no visible linking to one another, producing a celestial effect that is only possible in the digital world.",
