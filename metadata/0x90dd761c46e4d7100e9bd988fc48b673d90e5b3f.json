    "description": "We all go through difficult and complex times from time to time. Each of us reacts differently to these situations. While some are afraid and anxious, some go into a depressive mood. Those who perceive the world differently (artists) reflect these situations to their outside world with their drawings.\nI wanted to reflect these feelings that I experienced from time to time and that I got rid of with the power of my art with my art.",
