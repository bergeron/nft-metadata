    "description": "Her first look at life, is a look full of Confusion, Imagines, Rules, Feels and Wills.\nLost in a world that is infinitely vast and\nSuspended in a endless time !\nA world that is unconsciously present to her at every moment of awakening but does not surrender to her . \nRather, it extends in a fixed hierarchy from existence to infinite transcendence.\nThe world that is present to her now has a temporal horizon in its infinity on both sides, in its known and unknown, in its near and past life and its lifeless future.As if her world is collapsing ! \nFinds itself at all times without being able to change it and is in relation to a world that remains as it is forever in its constant change.\nIn the End She was Alone ! In a way No one understands…\n\nMusic By kiarash baktashian \n\nPhysical detail: \nOil painting on canvas 40×50 cm | 2019\n\nDigital Detail:  \n1890×1512 Pixels \n00:00:30 Sec",
