    "description": "Birdâ€™s eye view beauty which takes you far away from rainy everyday rutine to a hidden mountain forest road, losing you in astonishing colour palette of dark green and golden bown, finding you in a lonely melanchiolic time between late summer and early winter when quiet, appeasable autumn fuels your old favorite car while you take a getaway to your deep mind, driving through the glades, listening to yourn favorite radio station.",
