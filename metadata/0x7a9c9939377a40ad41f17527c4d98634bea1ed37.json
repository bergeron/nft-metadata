    "description": "Street fashion photograph, 1997 - Harajuku, Tokyo \nPhotographed by Shoichi Aoki \n\nOne of seven images selected by Shoichi Aoki from the first issue of FRUiTS magazine that feature in the NFT project. \n\nThe images are uncropped and include the camera film edge. This unintentional framing, due to being shot by a rangefinder camera, adds a rawness to the images that conveys a sense of realism that is lost in the cleanly cropped versions used in the magazine.\n\nStruck by the unique fashion attitudes and DIY styles evolving on the streets of Harajuku in the mid 90’s, Aoki began documenting Tokyo’s new fashion revolution. Culminating in the launch of FRUiTS magazine in 1997, the work of Shoichi Aoki has undeniably helped to establish Harajuku Fashion as the global powerhouse",
