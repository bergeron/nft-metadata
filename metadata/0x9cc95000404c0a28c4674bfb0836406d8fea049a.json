    "description": "Edna wasn't the most talkative or most interesting. She didn't possess her brothers Kei's magic abilities and disliked her own very new wolf heritage. But she saw the world in a beautiful, colourful way. Kei wished he could be satisfied with the mundane like Edna. To see beauty in the most ordinary. But he couldn't - so he travelled, met interesting people and saw rare and exquisite things to try to recreate the same feeling to no avail. Edna was able to enjoy a simple book at home and for him the whole world wasn't enough. Edna, on the other hand, envied her brother's outgoing nature. She wished to travel but was satisfied in her little cozy box. ",
