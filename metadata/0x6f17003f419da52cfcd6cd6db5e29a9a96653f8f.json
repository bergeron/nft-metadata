    "description": "I'm beyond excited to present \"Break The Tension\" as my Genesis track on Sound. \n\nBreak The Tension is a smooth R&B track written, produced and performed by myself. Created back in 2021 this song talks about the a particular instance between two people slowly building up powerful feelings for one another, to the point where there is only one direction to go. Seizing the moment, action is finally taken and the release of the intense build up results in an eclectic emotional and physical experience, finally feeling free around one another. \n\nMy musical journey has been building up for some time and as this new year has started I am excited, inspired, and more ready than ever to share my art with the world. Thank you for being apart of this journey. \n\n- Max ",
