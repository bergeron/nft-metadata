    "description": "Whoever buys this piece first will get a real ceramic work.which will not include the delivery fee Shipping costs are based on distance.\nAll proceeds from the auction will be donated to help Ukrainian victims of the brutal war. \n\nðŸ•ŠðŸŒ±\nThis project is made to support the Ukrainian-Russian war peace.  and rescue Ukrainian migrants from Russian invasion.  I believe that peaceful means of diplomacy are always possible.  The way out of violence is the road to endless violence.  The powerful should not lead innocents to the death of war just because they hold on to the void ideal that would take over everything in their lifetimes.  In these harsh environmental times, we humans on Earth should look for authenticity and persistence to the next generation.  A world full of mercy, love, and support without nonviolence.  Competition is only a small fraction of the human birth value.  May peace come soon  With love for art from a humble human being",
