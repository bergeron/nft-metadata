    "name": "Amunet II",
    "description": "\"Amunet II\" represents my first substantial hybrid Artist/AI work. I started by submitting my vision to the AI, then took it back and made a single art piece: the original \"Amunet: Goddess of Mystery.\" I adjusted and modified that piece with my hand-painting skills. I then submitted that piece to the engine and narrowed it down to a new iteration. After some notable re-finishings, I arrived at the completed creation of 'Amunet II.' \n\nI feel this represents a beautiful collaboration of artist & machine. As an illustrative artist who has been drawing comic-style feminine figures since my teens, this represents an exciting leap forward into something unusual and extraordinary in my continuing exploration of my idea of the Divine Feminine.",
