    "description": "Law Like Love series are based on my never-ending fascination with the poetry of W.H. Auden. \n\nIn this mini series, I have fed stanzas of his poem Law Like Love with additional words and tweaks to the AI to generate a set of images which were further trained and edited in Photoshop.\n\nIt is a great poem and it has led to a strange mix of images with scattered words sometimes discernible, authoritative characters resembling either a judge or a president at times and pieces of city life tossed in between. Love seems to have appeared less than Law here. Interesting..\n\nWhile the set of images were larger, I have chosen 6 images to represent the series which I hope to mint.\n\n...\n\nLaw Like Love: The Judge\nby Hulki Okan Tabak\non Foundation\nin Vagabondo collection\n1/1 minted on December 2021",
