    "description": "This is my brand's first print to be printed on clothing. I feel that it will shoot and I know that the result in merch sales will not be long in coming.\n\nThe person who owns this picture will receive a NAGGIBATOR WINTER PACK as a gift from NFT.\n\nI have a passion for painting on trains. I sleep and think about electric trains and subways. This drawing was born in my head as a symbol of trambombing in Russia. ED4M train going crazy",
