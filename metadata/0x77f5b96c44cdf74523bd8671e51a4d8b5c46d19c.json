    "description": "The only NFT that brings together 10,000 children from 206 countries.\nI've worked on it for a long time. I brought together 10,000 children's photos that I tried to collect unique from each other. I had some dreams for children.\n I did a research for the hopes of children.\n I searched on the internet and found 206 countries.\n I wrote down each country's name one by one and collected 10,000 ten thousand unique children's photos.\n I selected 20 boxes in a program, placed each photo in this box, and made 500 of the 20 photos.\n I selected 20 again from 500 and created 25 of 400 photos each.\n Then I combined them into a unique piece and made a single piece from 10,000 to ten thousand children.\n  400Ã—25=10,000 photos.\n  This is something I've wanted to do for years and I want to thank everyone who has helped me achieve this dream.\n       Resolution: 4096 pixels\n       Every offer is a donation.\nðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—ðŸ¤—",
