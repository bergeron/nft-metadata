    "description": "Cubism was an artistic movement that emerged in the early 20th century, and it is characterized by the use of geometric shapes and fragmented forms to depict objects in a manner that is abstract and non-representational. Cubism was developed by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and it has had a significant influence on the development of modern art.\n\nCubism was a revolutionary style of art that broke with traditional ways of representing objects in art. Instead of depicting objects from a single perspective, as had been the norm in Western art for centuries, cubist artists sought to depict objects from multiple viewpoints at the same time. This resulted in paintings and sculptures that were abstract and non-representational, and that often used geometric shapes and fractured forms to depict objects.\n\nCubism was an important artistic movement that helped to shape the course of modern art, and it is still considered to be one of the most influential artistic styles of the 20th century.",
