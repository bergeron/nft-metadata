    "description": "Raining always brings me a melancholy feeling so this illustration I made portrays that feel. Not intense nor depress emotion, everything is just below average a little bit but It also feels comfortable. \n\nThis piece holds a special place for me. It's the first time I succeeded in drawing something serious then decided to follow art. Thanks to it, although every challenge, sadness, depression I have when choosing this job, It reminds me that I can draw something this good and there is another me who wants to see and make beautiful things. It has kept me moving on drawing until now. When will I be able to make something this good again ?\n",
