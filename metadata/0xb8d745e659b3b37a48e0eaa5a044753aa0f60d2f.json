    "description": "Waking up before dawn to capture sunrise is one thing but staying up all night to capture the milky way over the horizon is what makes photography so challenging and equally enjoyable sometimes.\n\nThis is a composite of three shots taken at the same location in Sydney, Australia. Getting up at 4am to shoot the blue hour long exposure and the subsequent sunrise. I knew the flow of the water and light refracting off the reflections on the sand needed something more. So I created the idea of astro and sunrise together to create some magic.\n\nI will be adding more pieces like this in future as I find coastal compositions that work for the concept.\n\nLicense: No rights provided for commercial use - merchandise - distribution - or derivative works.
