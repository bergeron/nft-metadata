    "description": "As we spring forward, it’s a time to blossom. Into new areas of growth and creativity with water and sunshine. Which are the things I wanted to explore more of. So I ventured north towards the Gaviota coast. Where it’s a little calmer, even quieter, and largely untouched. The air is fresh, you can smell it when you park the car off the beaten path and walk the trail down to this hidden beach. A silhouetted coastline of mountains and hills with a new day ready to emerge from the Pacific Ocean.  Behind me, a trickling stream. In front, a new favorite sandbar. I smile before jumping in. Then for those 10 minutes of fresh daylight, I wish for a wave to roll through. \n\nSomewhere along the coast of California. ",
