    "name": "KITSUNE MERCENARY",
    "description": "According to yōkai folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form.\nKitsune are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a kitsune. The only thing worse could be that this name is worn by a mercenary whose target is YOU. After all, kitsune keeps their promises and seeks to repay any favor...\n\nThe tattoos on the girl's body have several meanings: foxes can feed on snakes, and every mercenary wants a good hunt, so the snake acts as a prey image for our heroine. In addition, snakes are a stylistic reference to the 1993 anime “Ninja Scroll”.\n\n1/1 Art created by Artem Over\n3161x3951, JPEG\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
