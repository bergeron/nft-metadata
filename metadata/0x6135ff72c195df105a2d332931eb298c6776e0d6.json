    "description": "Conceived and designed by fine jewelry designer, Mitchel Primrose, the 50 page Valley Of The Dolls Zine is a dynamic arrangement of polaroids, 35mm film and digital images mellifluously outlining a loose narrative of a woman in total control of every aspect of her life.  \nThe cover is one of my favorite polaroids of actress, model and muse, Alex, who is an incredible chameleon and embodies everything that Mitchel and I envisioned for our heroine; confidence, charisma, beauty, strength and vulnerability.  \nThe collector will receive a digital and signed physical hard copy of the first Zine produced.  \nThe collector will also receive a physical, framed polaroid from the Valley Of The Dolls Polaroid collection, revealed upon arrival of the Zine, and will also be air dropped the corresponding VOTD NFT polaroid.",
