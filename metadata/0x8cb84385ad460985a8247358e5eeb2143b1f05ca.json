    "description": "For some people, the village is home. That's where they come from. Born and raised. Even though they have to leave for overseas, in the end they will return to their village, to their longed for home.\n\nFor some, the village has a calming effect. When we are tired, stressed and overwhelmed by the noise and pollution of the city, country life becomes the only kind of 'paradise' available to people seeking peace, quiet, beauty and harmony.\n\nDate Created : 18/03/23\n4096 x 4096 px",
