    "description": "The oldest known octopus fossil is about 296 million years old. Octopuses have three hearts, blue blood and can regenerate cut limbs. Two-thirds of an octopusâ€™ neurones reside in its arms. After mating, males wander off to die.\n\nThis incredible creature has been present in the mythology of several cultures around the world, often symbolizing regeneration or linked to the Underworld spirits. It has also been a powerful symbol of female power across cultures throughout history.\n\nOCTOPUS DELIRIUM #2  is part of cross-chain series of works in which I explore the octopus as leitmotif.\n\n___\n\nKika Nicolela is a Brazilian artist, filmmaker and independent curator based in Brussels.
