    "description": "The Mosaic was a piece of art created by Ukrainian artists and was highly prized for its beauty and cultural significance. Despite facing the challenges of Russian invasions and occupation. However,  dude with a perforator turned the work of Ukrainian artists into debris. Reducing the once-majestic piece into a pile of debris. The loss of the Mosaic is a blow to the cultural heritage of the region, and a reminder of the fragility of even the most resilient works of art.",
