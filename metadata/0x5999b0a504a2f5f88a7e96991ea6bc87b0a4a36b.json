    "description": "Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a legend of a group of pirate admirals who were so feared and respected that even after their deaths, their spirits lived on. These spirits were said to take the form of glowing skulls, each one belonging to a different pirate admiral who had sailed the seas in search of treasure and adventure.\n\nAs the years went by, the legend of the pirate admiral skulls became more and more obscure, until it was almost forgotten. But one day, something strange happened. A group of the pirate admiral skulls appeared out of nowhere, making their way through the streets of a bustling city in the future.",
