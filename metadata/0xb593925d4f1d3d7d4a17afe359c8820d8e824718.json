Here, AI is a mediator and a translator that bridges linguistic information and visual sensories.\n\nCollaborated with the poet Shengji and AI, the artist wants to let images speak the hidden words, and translate the verbal description into a metaphoric expression.\n\nAt least 30% of the income will be donated to female charities.",
