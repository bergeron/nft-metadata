    "description": "Frustration is the feeling we get when we see other people succeeding while we stay where we are. We try to build our careers, create something new, but all our efforts seem to be in vain. Every time we think we've finally achieved something meaningful, everything collapses and falls into a black hole. It is a feeling of hopelessness and despair when it seems that no amount of hard work can bring results. We begin to doubt our abilities and wonder if it's even worth it to keep fighting. But it is important to remember that this is a temporary condition and that we can get out of this circle of samsara. We have to be optimistic and believe in ourselves. And if things don't work out, you have to look for new ways and opportunities. Never give up and keep moving forward!",
