    "description": "Jupiter.\n\nWith this work I want to represent the concept of human being as matter and the relationship with the universe.\n\nJupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System and he lacks a well-defined solid surface. The ongoing contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun.\n\nMeccanica Celeste takes you on a journey through the branch of astronomy that deals with the motions of objects in outer space, such as stars and planets. An ongoing series of works exploring and questioning our collective perception of reality as I attempt to rip open the fabric of reality.\n\n2693 x 3013 pixels\nPNG Ultra High detailed / High-Resolution image",
