What if you wake up because you are forced to wake up? Or you have to stay dreaming because you need to? \n\nWith this piece, VachBoy questions the integrity of the choices we make.\n\nOn the surface, we see a woman asleep, comfortably floating in the water. Her calmness and relaxed posture may have people believe that this is what she wants. But deep down, is she screaming for help, begging to be woken up from her dream? We may never know.",
