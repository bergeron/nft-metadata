    "description": "IN MEMORIAM\n\n1/1\n\n1600 x 2001 px\n\nI became obsessed with the sale of an antique doll lot. I drove to meet the owner to complete the transaction. She told me she had grown tired of having these dolls lay around after collecting them for some art project she never finished. Driving back home I felt a strong desire, a responsibility to immortalize these beautiful ragged objects. They looked so human, had been handled and loved by humans. Yet now they were so easily discarded.\n\nI want them to live forever.",
