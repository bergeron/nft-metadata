    "description": "The \"Memory's Gloss\" series of works is a documentation of the practice of remembering the root blocks of events from childhood. Moments that change the course of my perception of the outside world. The situation of the gap between \"I\" and \"not me\" “Someone else's Ball” is a gloss marking one of the first scenes which is stable in memory between 3 and 4 years of life.\n\nThe symbolism of this gloss extends beyond the limits of one event from (and) the life of a particular person, denoting various moments of self-identification as a process.\n\noriginal made: acrylic\\monotype\\brush\\masking film\\airbrush\\, 70*70 cm.\n",
