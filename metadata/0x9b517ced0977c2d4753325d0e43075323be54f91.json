    "description": "         Hi my name is Cailin Russo. I’ve been a singer-songwriter for almost 10 years. I was raised in San Diego California by 2 punk rock and rollers and a fan of music since the day I entered the earth. My father is in a pop punk band called Unwritten Law, he was the first to invite me into the songwriting space when I was 16. We had just suffered a house fire and were staying at a family friend's house who had the first recording equipment I had ever seen (consciously). From that point on I wrote songs semi religiously. \n \n\tI signed to a label a couple years later and began my serious musical journey. I dropped my first song called “September Rose” which did really well and is still one of my highest streamed songs, it is about love coming in at the wrong time. This tone of writing became a staple in a lot of my songs; very melancholic, feminine/ sexy. From there I continued to drop 2/3 more songs in a similar genre then completely switched up everything and started a very no doubt esq feeling band. The band lasted about 2 years and then we broke apart for me to continue to see my solo career bloom. \n \n\tAfter breaking apart from the band and label completely I was on a quest of rediscovery and rebirth. I made a complete body of work compiling all my favorite elements from indie, electronic and r&b. Independent from any label I am dropping my second single off the album “DIE DOWN”. DIE DOWN is a dark electronic song that was made by myself and JJ Scheffy in his basement mid pandemic. The story around the song is about 2 star crossed lovers that take their romance and inhibitions all the way to a point where nothing else exists. Everything else dies down. ",
