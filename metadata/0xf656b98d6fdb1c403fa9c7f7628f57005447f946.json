    "description": "Exploded Views are intimate photographs of fires in controlled situations that focus on the physics behind fire behavior only moments after ignition, looking specifically at how it spreads. Taking its title from technical drawings of objects that show the relationship to the assembly of various parts, this series highlights our fascination with fire and how it influences our relationship with the environment.
