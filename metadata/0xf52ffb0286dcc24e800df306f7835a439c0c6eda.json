    "description": "SLIDES X MWAMBATIME\n\nThe Slide and Sock are perfect design templates. Kinda overlooked imo.  This edition is my response to that. Let's have some fun with it :)\n\n-------\n\nThank you to all who have either minted or showed support by the kind comments. This is my first ever edition, and will be open for the next year or so, or until a certain number of mints are reached. Not really sure to be honest though, and I'm good with that because this is an art project right? Flexible, nimble, and un-hurried. Maybe let it collect a little dust for a while, then circle back in a few  to see what's up? My hope is that this edition would end up as one of those pleasant surprises in the space. We'll just see how it goes. In the meantime I'll continue on the journey to develop a personal style and design language that is uniquely my own. Thanks again for finding my art and rocking with me along the way. \n  ‚úåüèø - Hann\n\n-------\n\nSLIDES X MWAMBATIME\n\n2023\n\nNon-fungible Token ERC-721 Digital Collectable \n\nminted on xx 2023, this NFT is an open edition jpg. image at 5000x5000px\n\nmint address: 0xf52Ffb0286dcc24e800dF306f7835a439C0c6EDa",
