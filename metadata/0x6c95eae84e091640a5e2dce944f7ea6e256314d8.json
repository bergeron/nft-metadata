    "description": "This piece is inspired by the Mexican Saint and goddess of death, Santa Muerte. She is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife. Josh felt compelled to create this work during the COVID-19 lockdown. Watching the death toll rise, he thought about the families and friends of the ones who passed. Wishing peace over them, this artwork was created. While he is not a follower of Santa Muerte, he thought she perfectly personified his feelings. Her calm face watches over the world in her hands, wishing peace over those in mourning.",
