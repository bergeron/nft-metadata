    "description": "The inspiration for this piece came from the idea of a black hole slowly pulling in and destroying everything around it. When this piece was created, we were in the middle of a massive liquidation cascade, everything was apart, and so many big players were getting blown up. It literally felt like the end of the world. That is when I got the idea of tungsten being held together by the Pepes. Credit to Norupixels for letting me use her pixel Pepe faces. I imagined a world where everything was falling apart or collapsing like a star with Tungsten being in the middle. The Pepes touching the Tungsten reminded me of the 'Creation of Adam.' I thought it was a wonderful touch.",
