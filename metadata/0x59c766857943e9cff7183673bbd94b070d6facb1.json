    "description": "During the opening installation of the Nike x OFF-WHITE “The Ten” in 2017, I was selected by Nike to be interviewed by Virgil Abloh and John Margaritis of New York Sunshine on Wall St in New York City. During this interview, I was showing the paintings and photographs I created throughout my journey as a creator. The audio was captured on a AGPTEK recorder provided by Nike. All collectors of this NFT will receive the full version of the interview.",
