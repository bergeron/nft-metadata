    "description": "LNRZ ON SOUND WK 9\n\nThis jaunty little dittie was made especially for the season by your friends at LNRZ. \n\nStarring freshman artist Madalen Duke (she of the silky voice and sharp pen), produced by Clear eyes, and featuring backing vocals from Margarida of Vaarwell.\n\nA note from Madalen:\n\n“Evergreen is a nostalgic and introspective track, and captures the idea of constancy, relating evergreens which stay green all year round with the feeling of a relationship that is lasting.”\n",
