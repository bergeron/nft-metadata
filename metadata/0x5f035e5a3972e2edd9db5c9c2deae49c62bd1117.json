    "description": "I was 9066 km away from my hometown when it went into lockdown.\nIn my opinion Dutch classical architecture is at it’s prettiest on quiet moments without the distraction of traffic and noise. When I worked as a caretaker I used to start at 6am and bike my way through the city fully taking in it’s beauty. \nThat was many years ago and the next time I would see images like this it would be on the news in 2020.\n\nThis work symbolises that beauty although I changed the setting to an afternoon where the city is fully alive, yet everybody indoors.\nThe canal boasts a boat in the center of it, hinting at the characters wishing to command it, the bikes are there yet no cyclist on it. In the distance smoke leaves chimneys. \nA city alive during different times. \n\nPainted with acrylics on canvas \nDeconstructed in Photoshop \nAnimated in After Effects.\nMusic by me.",
