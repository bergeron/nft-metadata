    "description": "The Cave #01\n\n----------------\n\nThis work is part of \"The Cave\" series:\n\n“The Cave” is a series of 3 digital works inspired by Plato's famous allegory of the cave. \n\nIn his allegory, Plato imagines a cave in which a group of people cannot see real objects, only their shadows. The shadows are part of these people’s reality, but they do not portray a complete image of the real world.\n\nA similar reflection on the relationship between reality and illusion can be applied also to the relationship between physical, virtual and digital worlds.\n\n\"The Cave\" series proposes a meditation on this relationship and invites reflection on the concepts of perception and reality.",
