The art acts as the visual representation of the masterfully written poem 'Two Sided' by Luca Ponsato.\n\nEach bidder will receive the poem 'Two Sided' written by Luca Ponsato.\n\n'Two Sided'  \nTwo sides to every fight  \nTwo sides to every struggle  \nAnd when they start inside myself  \nPart of me is the one in trouble  \nAs one side starts to grow  \nThe other must decay  \nAnd if I get to where I want  \nThat other side must fade away  \nTwo sides to every battle \nTwo sides to every war  \nBut I’ll continue to take these matchups  \nCause I know I’m worth fighting for.",
