    "description": "REM Energy is the result of a live art performance which was guided by the sound, energy, and vibrations surrounding Creatress during its creation. This VR artwork was created in front of a live audience on a large mirrored projector during a Veecon after party at the Rem5VR Virtual Reality Laboratory May 20th, 2022 by Sarai Mora.\n\nThis was the twelfth public VR performance by Creatress, in front of a live audience. The energy from within me, the energy of city, the energy of the audience, and the energy of co-creation was all at play during the creation of this artwork. The vibrations from each voice, each heartbeat, each wave of sound coming from the speakers all affected the way this artwork emerged from the synergistic ether.\n\nCreated in Virtual Reality using the application Gravity Sketch for Oculus Quest 2.
