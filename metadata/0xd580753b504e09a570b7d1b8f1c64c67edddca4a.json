    "description": "In this collection, I have several approaches to the subject, but I drew all of them with a pencil. One approach is to drawing my imaginary characters, the other approach is to drawing plants around me, and sometimes I want to draw any other subject with this material. I still have a strong interest in working with physical materials, and I think the power and attractive quality of working with pencil, oil paint and other physical materials can not be compared to its digital execution.",
