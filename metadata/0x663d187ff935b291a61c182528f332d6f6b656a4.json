    "description": "I love the ocean. I admire his strength and beauty. I am very upset that people litter the reservoirs... All underwater creatures suffer from this! It is very important that the water of our oceans remains clean and transparent as in ancient times!\n\nI created this work on myself, it took me 7 hours.  I painted with face painting.",
