    "description": "Specifications:\n\nPhygital (NFT includes a Physical piece)\n\n30cm high resin statue \n\nPainted in black 3.0\n\nWooden pedestal\n\n“UGGAR”\n\nI created “UGGAR” as an alter ego. UGGAR is a non-filtered version of Yassa with his bittersweet opinion, not scared to tell what is wrong from what is right. UGGAR is the version of me that will ask the painful questions that float around my mind, and answers them correctly. UGGAR is fearless and picks himself above anyone else. \nUGGAR is a mood to have.\n\n“KAGE”\n\nThe meaning of KAGE(shadow) lies within my deep psyche/emotions or rather lack thereof. This piece is so dark you can't make out any feature which is a representation of the sadness I can feel. A sadness so dark it is numbing. And in this sadness I cannot find the reason behind it. It then results in a lack of feeling a state of nothingness. A state of apathy.\n",
