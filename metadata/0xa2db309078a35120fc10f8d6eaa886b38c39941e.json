    "description": "The lone tree in this image represents me at the moment. Alone and lonely in the vast landscape. The sky represents everything around me. But even when you see clouds there's always light in the horizon. The stars are there to give me hope and guidance through this difficult time. This is a composite created to show in a piece of art my feelings at this very moment but also that everything's always gets better with time",
