    "description": "Overcast condition is the perfect recipe for monochrome images. I was out hiking at the Rocky Mountains National Park to Emerald Lake when I took this picture. As a landscape photographer, I like it when the weather is moody, and with the dark ominous clouds rolling in over jagged mountains, a touch of snow over the granite and the dead branches and tree-trunks decorating the icy lake provided me with the perfect moment.  \n\nWalking into the icy cold waters ankle-deep was no fun and when I finally came out of the water, I could barely feel my feet but the satisfaction of stretching myself to overcome challenges thrown at me is something that I have always enjoyed and has been a part of my creative process.",
