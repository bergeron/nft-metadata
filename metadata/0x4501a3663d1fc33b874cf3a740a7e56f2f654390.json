    "name": "Halley's Tears",
    "description": "A musical and visual journey deep in the heart of the Canadian Rockies. \n\nShot in 2019 at Berg Lake in Mount Robson National Park, Canada. I created this scene to represent the Eta Aquariids meteor shower, which peaks on the night of May 6 each year, the same day this piece was released. The meteor shower originates from Halley's Comet, which inspired the overall theme and title of this image, \"Halley's Tears\"\n\nThis is my very first ever minted NFT and marks the beginning of a grand new adventure for me into the cosmic depths of Web3.\n\nThe collector of this piece will also receive an airdropped full resolution 5694x7117 JPEG of the same image.",
