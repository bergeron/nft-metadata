    "description": "A useless pile of bones… Or is it?\n\nMystic Bones are powerful and enchanted relics; they symbolise a fallen Champion and carry with them its spirit. The Red Village team are collectors at heart, fascinated by relics of bygone eras and gaming lore. The enduring power of the legendary Easter egg is always front of mind. But more importantly, let’s just say for now that Mystic Bones will want a home, a resting place. They’ll need to return to the cold ground, laid at peace at last; ashes to ashes, dust to dust.",
