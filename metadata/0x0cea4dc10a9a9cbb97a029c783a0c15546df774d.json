    "description": "Robert Frost wrote this poem in 1922. What at first glance seems a simple contemplative act, of a person in the middle of a snowy forest, is a metaphor of health and well-being, of the path we take in life towards death. \n\nI have always been struck by how transcendent and profound this great poem is. Also its recent history. \n\nChoral music composer Eric Whitacre composed a work for this poem in 2012. However he was unable to publish it due to a legal battle brought by the family of the late Robert Frost over the ownership rights to the work. \n\nWhitacre's decision was to ask poet Charles Anthony Silvestri to create a poem for the music he had composed. \n\nAs of 2019, Robert Frost's original poem is royalty-free.\n\nI have used an Artificial Intelligence model to render it in a dreamlike way. \n\nTechnical Specifications: \n\n- Video Generation: Story2Hallucination notebook by HoverSquid.\n- Synthetic Voice: English female voice TTS demo using open source projects NVIDIA Tacrotron2 and Waveflow.",
