    "description": "It was a dark, gloomy night. The storm was so fierce that the windows in the houses were shaking and the sound of branches breaking from the trees was lost in the howling of the wind. Most of the people walking in the street were running to get home or huddled tightly in their cars. However, there was only one woman in the middle of the storm.\n\nShe was walking in the middle of the storm, her wet hair sticking to her face, wearing only a light jacket. All the chaos around her seemed to have no effect on her.\n\n-Music by Telecasted-",
