    "description": "\"She lost her heart, and her head, then fled to search, not feeling dread\" //\n\nSilent Travelers is the newest chapter from the multi-awarded visual narrative Tale of the Blue Pear.\nIt shows a deeper, more intimate insight into the characters that inhabit this parallel universe and their goings-on in these surreal surroundings.\n\nAn eerie atmosphere hangs in the air where these personified creatures dwell amongst overgrown interiors, lush gardens and symbolic elements, all of which are protagonists or object narratives, in this (anti) utopian world. //\n\nTale of the Blue Pear is an internationally exhibited body of work, started in 2013. It consists of a series of artworks about a woman who enters a parallel universe, hoping to find her lost heart, which has taken the form of a pear. On her quest for the pear she finds talking animals, strange characters, giant beings, superpowers, as well as her own alter egos.\n\nWith subtle elements of allegory and irony, this visual story raises questions about our own lives and the never-ending quest for inner peace and happiness.   \n",
