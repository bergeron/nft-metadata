    "description": "The artwork is an example of the intersection between empathy and ageing. The collage is composed of torn paper pieces, representing a different layer of feeling that accumulates as we grow older. As the layers build up, they obscure the deeper aspects of ourselves, making us increasingly difficult to see or understand.\nHowever, there is a subtle beauty in this process. As we age, the layers of paper begin to peel away, revealing more of our inner selves to the world. This gradual unmasking allows us to connect more deeply with others, as we become increasingly transparent and vulnerable.\nYet, the impact of technology on human connection complicates this process. As we become more reliant on screens and digital communication, our ability to empathize with others and understand their emotions becoming more difficult to read and understand, this series is to celebrate the human connection in this digital era.",
