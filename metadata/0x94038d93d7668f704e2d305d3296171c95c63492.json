    "description": "A timeless bridge between 2 artists from the 16th Century and Jæn from the 21st. Frans Huys, a Belgian illustrator (1522-1562), made splendid illustrations of grotesque masks from Flemish sculptor Cornelis Floris de Vriendt (1514-1575), printed to provide stone carvers and others with interesting faces to adorn buildings. The tradition of mascarons date back to Ancient Greece, surviving until the Renaissance through the Roman Empire's vestige.\n\nThrough the printing press, and then digitisation, I could find and restore them carefully, to then add my surreal magic, encode the originals in the audio frequencies of the minimalistic melodies I composed, generate AI versions to briefly replace the works during glitches.\n\nThe result was uploaded straight to contemporary cryptoart - here it stands, floating in the digital void, outside of time. This collaboration of 3 European Artists over 5 centuries is an invitation to ponder about time, culture and tools. The project gives birth to a metaphorical blockchain made of time and art - The Timechain. Collectors become Patrons of the III Renaissances - the old one, the new one, and the future one in which an artist will bring the next iteration of this legacy rooted thousands of years in the past.",
