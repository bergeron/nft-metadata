    "description": "In 2005, the street artist Banksy hacked off a piece of the Israeli West Bank Barrier and used it as the focal point of a new piece: a treasure hunt. A secret word was written on the underside of the rock. That word was \"SPIKE\". The first person to find the rock and email the secret word to Banksy would become the owner of a certified original Banksy artwork.\n\nValuart is proud to now enable the rebirth of this extraordinary piece of art as an NFT Artwork.\n\nThe Spike by Banksy NFT Artwork presents an astonishing environment produced by Valuart, created by combining cutting-edge CGI with a breathtaking aria, \"E lucevan le stelle\", performed by Vittorio Grigolo himself.",
