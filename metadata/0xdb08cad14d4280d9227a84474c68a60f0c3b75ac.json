    "description": "This sing was inspired and created out of a very cool and humbling moment around a year ago.\n\nMy first song, CHILDHOOD, the first song on sound.xyz, was purchased on the secondary market by @CR41GD (on twitter) for around 8 eth (or exactly that). It was the highest secondary at the time, and although I only received 10% royalties, it marked a very significant moment for me. That my art is valued outside of just me creating it. It was strange and surreal, but incredibly humbling to feel such love for my art.\n\nI had told Craig that I would make a song dedicated to the moment and include the feelings I felt at that time. Although times change, and this moment is filled with stresses and obstacles, it is nice to look back at that moment and know that times like that will come again.\n\nThank you all very much.",
