    "description": "NeoRama is about recomposing Ramayanaâ€™s ancient tale to fit modern storytelling methods and the modern world. The journey begins by slowly revealing the identity of each main faction in the story. In the first phase of our launch we will reveal Vanaras, which is one of the main tribes in NeoRama and they have an important role in our Web 3.0 storytelling. Vanaras are secretive forest dwellers peacefully in their home deep in the jungles. Fiercely territorial, however they are calm unless provoked. If angered the provoker will face the wrath of the society descending on them. \n",
