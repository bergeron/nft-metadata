    "description": "As the world comes together in solidarity for Ukraine during this heart-wrenchingly difficult time, the NFT community is uniquely positioned to have an immense, positive impact if we can do the same. We have the opportunity to leverage our worldwide community of holders with its deep sense of camaraderie to come together, and show kindness in the face of such violence. We sympathize with the people of Ukraine and strongly condemn this violence. We see the urgent needs of 2.5 million Ukrainians fleeing war and our hearts go out to them. As such, GATE has created a special edition Ukraine Relief White Rabbit to help alleviate as much suffering as we can, by using 100% of the proceeds from the mint to directly provide aid and supplies to Ukrainian refugees.",
