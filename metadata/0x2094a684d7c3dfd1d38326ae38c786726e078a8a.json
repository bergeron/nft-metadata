    "description": "September, 2011\nI had the desire to break out, leaving for a journey that I had no idea will take me around the world. \n\nThat image represents the moment I left on a bicycle trip, without any money, no health insurance, just a few things on my bike & a tent that I just put wherever I got tired after a long day on the road.\n\nI had to work for my food on the farms across Europe and I will never forget, that my will power grew from day to day, because the only thing that I truly wanted to see: was our world and the people who are living on it.\n\nI told the story of the start, back in 2011, in a video.\nSee https://youtu.be/jpY9SuH28B4 \n\nToday, so many years later, more than a decade, I understand that this image needs to be on the ETH chain, because as my drive to spread good vibes across the world will never change within me, this TRX I do now will be unique and can never be changed too.\n\nDisclaimer: I promise to donate 100% of funds to people in need on my bicycle trips around the world.\n",
