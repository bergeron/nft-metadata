    "description": "Strung up by the invisible strings of deadly perfectionism, our marionette is left stuck in a broken timeline. “Echo Of The Maddened Marionette” delves into the psyche of a crazed ballerina, unveiling what lurks beneath her poised and elegant facade. The marionette constantly battles between her ideal self and the toll it takes to get there. This piece erases the borders between the opposing dimensions of her mind state."
