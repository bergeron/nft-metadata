    "description": "Color can be associated with feelings like happiness, sadness and anger. Through this piece i created i channeled multiple colors through how a soul looks when they are holding all their angry emotions bottled up inside. There are days when it will rise to the surface but this is the start, this is where our intense explosion of emotions stem from. Our inability to express and share our emotions in a conducive manner is the reason why this creation i made speaks so much to me. The colors red i used as that is the most widely associated color with anger. Blue signifies sensitivity and also freedom where that's what we need when it comes to the emotion that is anger. I used green to create a sense of growth for as we express and channel our anger we grow. This piece is called Diablo",
