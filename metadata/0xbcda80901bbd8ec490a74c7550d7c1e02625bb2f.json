    "description": "Inspired by the Japanese art of Kintsugi, this personal project reflects the fault-lines that have shattered oneâ€™s body, breaking it into shreds without any possibility to be the same as before. The project itself, reflecting the feelings of a young woman, is part of revealing vulnerability, acceptance, and self-love through looking back at periods of life that have hurt so much. Self-esteem challenges, trauma, anxiety, and mental health issues have all been transformed into strengths and life lessons.\nStill, healing the broken parts with gold is an ongoing process that involves choosing love and respect for the body, mind, and soul over self-destructive behavior experienced in the past. Only by self-care, sensitivity, and awareness do we find beautiful journeys that bring us to heights that would not be possible without the breaking.",
