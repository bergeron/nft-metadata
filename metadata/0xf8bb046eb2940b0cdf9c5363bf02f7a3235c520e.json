    "description": "Goddess of death, time, and doomsday.\n\nAssociated with sexuality and violence but is also considered a strong mother figure and symbol of motherly love.\n\nThe gods produced her to fight against the unbeatable, self-regenerating demon - Raktabija. The legend entails that more demons were created on each blood drop of Raktabija. Kali lopped off his head with a sword and then drank all of his blood, ensuring none fell to the ground and thereby ensuring no more demons could menace the world.",
