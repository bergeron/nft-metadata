    "description": "This collection is inspired by my experimental short film the immortality of the crab, shot on super 8 film and made with in-camera editing and no post-production. \nthe immortality of the crab was included in the Straight 8 - 2019 London Selection and was screened at the Regent Street Cinema as well as several film festivals, including the 58th Ann Arbor Film Festival. \n\nI took a high-quality picture of each artwork, created with acrylics and cutting tools, and transformed them into a collection of visual music abstract art. \nEach frame is an artistic interpretation of the soundtrack, which was composed using only sounds sampled from cardboard.\n\nEach NFT in this collection comprises high-quality images of one of the 68 cardboard strips made for the film, paired with the original soundtrack that I used to generate the abstract artwork on each frame.\n\nArtworks & Animation: Giacomo Manzotti \nSound Design: SonicMeal",
