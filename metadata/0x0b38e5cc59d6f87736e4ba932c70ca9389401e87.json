    "description": "RAIJIN Raijin\nA deity that deifies thunder. Names such as Raiden-sama, Narukami, Dondo-kami, Hata-kami, Inazuma-sama, Ikazuchi, and Kaminari are often based on the sound of thunder and lightning. As a water god and fire god, the thunder god was regarded as a mediator between heaven and earth, and thunder also meant the manifestation of a deity, as in the name Kandachi.\nBenefits\nMany shrines worship the god of thunder to pray for thunder and water disasters, and for a bountiful harvest of crops, and some have \"Raijin\" in the company name.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
