    "description": "Work of the artist Kevin Sacchi representing Jamna, an ancient pre-Ukrainian culture of the 36th century BC, in the form of a female angel spreading her wings in front of men and women, reminding them that the future is not built with violence but with, compassion, understanding and mutual help. The work is dedicated to peace and to the many victims of the ongoing war against the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. To support this cause in a concrete way, the artist, together with Kevin Sacchi Brand, offers to charity a large part of the sum raised from this work to non-profit associations dedicated to the survivors, refugees, and wounded of the war.",
