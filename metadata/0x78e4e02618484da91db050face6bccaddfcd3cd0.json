    "description": "This is a picture from Banaras, India where â€œDeep Deepavali is being celebrated. This is the festival of lights and whole Banaras lights up during this festival with lamps, firecrackers and lights. \n\nPeople have smile in their faces and the everyone holds grace in their heart. People come together as families. As I strolled across the river banks with lights all around I found these three puppies cuddling around each other. \n\nMy heart filled with ecstasy when I spotted one of the black spots in one of them looked like a heart. As if, God himself wanted to symbolize love and harmony through them.\n\nLICENSE:\nExtended Editorial: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings.
