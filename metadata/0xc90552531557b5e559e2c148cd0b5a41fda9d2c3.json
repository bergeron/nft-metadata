    "description": "Welcome to cyberspace. You can be anyone you want here. <3\n\nA love letter to the exploration of identity on the internet, character creation tools, and how digital avatars can help us to understand just who we are and where weâ€™re going.\n\nCGI vector art visuals rendered via x/y mode on a 1981 oscilloscope. Other visuals created with a 1992 titlemaker, an analog glitch synth called the Dreamweapon, and recorded from an early 1980s amber phosphor terminal monitor. CGI graphics made with Blender and my personal Vtube avatar.\n\nOriginal music loop made with an electric bass guitar and digital recreations of early 80s sound modules.",
