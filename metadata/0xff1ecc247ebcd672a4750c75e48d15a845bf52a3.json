    "description": "Use Generative adversarial network to create art through machine learning and social engineering,\" says team member Jonathan Martin. , which he first presented at ICML 2013 in San Diego, California. His aim is \"to build creative systems that perform an experiment based on a pre-existing set of rules.\" This work includes the use for both artists themselves as well others including researchers studying their artistic style, which takes advantage many methods from computer vision. The paper describes how this approach can be used to enhance your own compositions with powerful tools like deep neural networks, adaptive reinforcement learning (ASL), multivariate inference, high order optimization, recurrent neural nets etcâ€¦All these techniques are applied inside of VGGNet's",
