    "description": "“The Next Chapter” - The inspiration for the piece was my feelings at the time of creating it. It was made shortly after my Create Or Die collection sold out. Before this, I had a lot of doubt in myself. For some reason, I couldn’t see past the idea of someone actually liking my art.\n\n The transformation began when I made my first derivative for someone and they genuinely liked it. I felt like it was the worlds way of telling me that if you trust in yourself and believe in what you want to create, then the world will start placing opportunities everywhere you go. \n\nIn the piece my character is in a sense, burning. But, the only things that are burning away are my past beliefs of who I am and what I can accomplish. \n\nWe have the power to burn away parts of ourselves that do not serve us. \n\nIt comes down to trusting that there is something better after our old self is burned and gone.",
