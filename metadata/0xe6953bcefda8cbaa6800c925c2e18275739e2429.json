    "description": "This is Fuego, one of the most active volcano in Central America. I spent a whole night camping on top of another volcano to observe and capture this one erupting every minute, for hours and hours. The sound, the vibrations and the fascination got me through the night without any sleep. \n\nThis is a moment in my life as a travel photographer that I will always remember. Thanks Guatemala!",
