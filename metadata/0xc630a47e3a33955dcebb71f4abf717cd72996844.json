    "description": "This magical scene waited for us at the end of a treacherous 11 mile hike. Mud, rock, cliffs, the hike demanded full attention with every footstep. While the experience was one of the most physically challenging of my life, it was also one of the most rewarding. The hike spanned across the ridges of the notorious Na Pali coast on Kauai and the destination was a lush landscape with epic views of the coast, rivers and waterfalls. We set up a tent right on the edge of the cliffs so that we could hear the thunderous waves crashing throughout the night. We spent two nights at camp, giving us a full day to explore. Rolling storms gave this location a dynamic liveliness as the sunshine would fade into ominous grey clouds then to vibrant rainbows and back again. This river was off to the side of our camp in a secluded spot. As the warm rain pattered down and the fog enveloped the coast we decided to capture the mood with a nude portrait shot on 35mm lomography 400 film. ",
