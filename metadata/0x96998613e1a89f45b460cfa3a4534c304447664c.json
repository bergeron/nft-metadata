    "description": "Two months ago, on 11.13 last year, my dad passed away. It was my first experience of someone close to me dying and the hardest thing I've ever gone through. As I worked on this piece, I found myself crying many times and abandoning it; But I kept coming back to it because working on it was a kind of mourning and expression of feelings for me.\n\nFeeling so helpless and empty, crying and not venting, getting sadder every day; Fear of forgetting his memories, his voice, his face, and the feeling of not having his support for the rest of my life; These emotions inspired me to create this artwork.\n\nit also includes some of my favorite photos of him and me.\nsize: 5000x5000 px\nmade by photoshop and illustrator",
