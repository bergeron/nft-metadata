    "description": "Story behind the artwork:\n\nThe Bond films are classics. Again and again extravagant or abandoned places, hotel, buildings, etc. play the film backdrop for it. Inspired by this, this work of art was created. I can literally see the script in front of me. Mr. Bond and his antagonist are up to mischief in this hotel. There is also a jump into the lake and a chase into the mountains. No Bond film is complete without female beauty. Everyone is welcome to imagine her for themselves.\n\nArtist: Kathrin Federer\nCreated 2022 in Photoshop\n8832 x 7360 px | 300 dpi\nEdition 1/1\n\nValid Copyright and License: CC-ND-SA.\nThe collector receives the original JPG and TIFF on request.",
