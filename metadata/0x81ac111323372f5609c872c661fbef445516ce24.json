    "description": "Real 1/1 unique macro photography.\n\"Photographing the invisible\" bringing to light the explosion of sunlight and energy filtered through a pyramidal prism and a subsequent crystal pyramid with real macro photography. The impact of sunlight at a certain time of the day with the pyramid creates a real explosion of colors with different vibrational frequencies. The energy and the frequency of the colors are in tune with the emotional frequency of the viewer who observes them, inviting him to reflect and to look at the world with other eyes, trying to raise his own energy level to activate positive energies and light. We need high frequency light to fight the dark and low frequencies and to create a universe of positive vibrations. The frequency of the red symbol of love and passion activates the feelings of love and strength and creativity harmonized with the balancing green in a positive bouquet of colors and energies.",
