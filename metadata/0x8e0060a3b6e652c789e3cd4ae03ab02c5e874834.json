    "description": "Alone\nWhat makes this life meaningful to us? Love, hope, pain, happiness, longing and memories..\nWhat matters is how we evaluate this life. Our family, our friends and our entire community. Perhaps the biggest mistake we all make is to be stuck in the past. We have to look forward and enjoy the moment. Life is too short..\nWe were born alone and will die alone.\n\n\nThe photograph won the second prize in the \"Alone\" National \"Ancient Values\" photography contest, one of the important works in my life.\n\n\n\nArtist: K.Deniz Kalayci\nCamera: Nikon D90\nDimensions: 4288× 2848\nResolution: 300 dpi\nLocation: Malatya / Turkey\nDate:22/08/2013\nEdition: 1/1",
