    "description": "This drop is dedicated to the situation in Ukraine.\nNFT that can save lives. This Art was drawn under the explosions of shells in my city. While the walls and the floor were shaking - I was painting, because this is the only way I can help people now.\n\nMany Ukrainians lost their homes and loved ones because of the war. The country began to have problems with food and medicine. They either don't exist or the price is too high. This hit on the elderly and those who had no money.\n\nThis NFT project was created to help with groceries and others in need. I am against war! The money will be spent on civilians.\n\nThe more people learn about this project, the higher is the chance to help those in need.\n\nThanks to everyone who pays attention, reposts and, of course, buys.\n\nby Nikita Demidov \nTwitter: @Nikitoniy",
