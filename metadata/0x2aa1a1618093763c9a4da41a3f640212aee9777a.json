    "description": "Who is Patrick Mahomes? Well, prior to his election to the NFL in 2017, Patrick Mahomes, son of former MLB pitcher Pat Mahomes Sr., played baseball and football for Whitehouse High School and Texas Tech.  Mahomes got selected by the Kansas City Chiefs for the 10th overall pick in the very 1st round of the 2017 NFL Draft. In 2018, he was only the second quarterback in NFL history to make 50 touchdowns and 5,000 passing yards in a single season and was crowned as the NFL’s Most Valuable Player.  He became Super Bowl MVP after his third professional season in 2020.  With the Chiefs, later that year, he signed a record 10-year contract worth $503 million.  In February 2021, he played in his second Super Bowl.  He is also the only sports and professional sports player in North America with the most illustrious contract history, making him the NFL’s most marketable player.
