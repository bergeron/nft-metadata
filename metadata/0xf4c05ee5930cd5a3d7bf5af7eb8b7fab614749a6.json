    "description": "a dad who has no legs, wearing sun glasses, \na mum next to her daugher, and prouds of\nher daugherâ€™s beauty, an old man giving\na candy to the girl, red abstract backround\nAs artists, we have an infinite imagination to create a concept, regardless of our medium (whether it be AI, ready-made objects, typography, traditional art,etc.) \nAs a limited member of an AI program, I paid $10 to use it, but the program did not fully understand the prompt I gave in the first attempt. If I had continued to use AI, I would have had to find the right words to get it to understand the concept in my creative mind.\nAs an artist who primarily uses traditional methods, I used a method that blends traditional and digital media. More easy :)\nAlthough many people say that AI is easy, for me, being able to produce what I have designed in my mind with AI is currently more difficult.\nI have great respect for the artists who can realize what they imagine in their creative minds through artificial intelligence.\n\n\n",
