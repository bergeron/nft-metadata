    "description": "20.08.22 I have a choice between sleeping and waking up at 5 a.m. Or not sleeping at all. I’m choosing second way. Is it good idea? idk, any way i wouldn’t wake up at 5 am if i would sleep, so looks like i don’t have a chance to choose. This night is movie night, today me, Vik and Maria watching Jay and Silent Bob. This is cool film for stoners, but i’m not a stoner but anyway it’s funny stupid comedy, i love this kind of movie. I can’t understand ppl who likes movies where u need to think, movies must be chilling and funny. Another night passed, i’m going to sleep bcz tomorrow i have some plans.  ",
