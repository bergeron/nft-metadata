    "description": "When I was little, I was an insecure, timid, and quiet person. I like that because I have a body that is too thin. I was always behind in sports lessons, and I was often slapped by upperclassmen. The point is, I was often intimidated at that time. That's what makes me an insecure, timid, and quiet person. However, all of those things made me imagine what would happen if I suddenly had the power to defend myself. That's why I made masks out of paper and toy guns out of banana leaves. I hope this imagination can make me strong. The paper mask in this work that I draw is made of shiny steel and reflects colors, which means that I can be strong through these conditions and overcome various problems that exist. It may seem like hiding behind a mask, but it really helps me be strong.\n\nThis is the beginning of a series of stories that will continue in the future.",
