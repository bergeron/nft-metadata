    "description": "IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE BRIGHT SIDE I'LL SIT WITH YOU IN THE DARK\n\nPhotographed in an abandoned boarding school, a shelter for children and women at risk. The ghosts seen in the images as the semi-transparent silhouettes, show behind them only the ruins that remain. They represent the “transparent” feeling shared by many women in the fringes of society. Casted aside by the mainstream. women who experienced violence, and girls who have fallen into the margins of society. From there deterioration of their condition and the path to crime and self-destruction is not long.\nWe hope that by creating this intriguing symbolic imagery we can deepen public involvement and raise awareness to this cause.\nWe create a certain type of photography that requires a team to work together before and during each exposure to achieve our surreal results directly in-camera.\nAll images are light painting photography created in real time, captured to the camera in one single photographic frame.\n\n",
