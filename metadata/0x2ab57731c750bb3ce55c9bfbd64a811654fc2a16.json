    "description": "Fireball, a relief pitcher, is an former executive from a fortune 500 company who lost his girlfriend and making him into a rebel. Later while trying to relive his high school days, he began throwing again and pitching for a local summer adult league. Dinger Squad learned of his pitching heat at 125mph and was invited to try out for the team. Although Fireball's incredibly fast pitch lacks control, Fireball makes the team. Women love his tough biker look and teammates love the fire behind his pitch. Leads the league in most shutouts (50) in a single season.",
