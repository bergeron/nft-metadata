    "description": "While waiting for a friend, I noticed shadows creeping along the wall as people passed by. The artistic swirls of graffiti made it feel like the credits to an urban film that I would like to see. This shadow passing perfectly landed on a swirly crown, making him King For A Day. \n\nArtist: Erik Witsoe \nLocation: Warsaw, Poland \nDimension 5240 x 3293\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
