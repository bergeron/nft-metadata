    "description": " remembered again by the gods.\n\n\n\nOne god led his faith race down from the sky, one devil climbed out of the abyss.\n\n\n\nThe gods asked humans to sacrifice their souls and serve themselves as emotionless believers.\n\n\n\nThe devil has beguiled man into signing a contract, becoming the devil's apostle.\n\n\n\nFrom that day on, mankind learned a cruel truth. It turned out that the gods were not as kind as they were told.",
