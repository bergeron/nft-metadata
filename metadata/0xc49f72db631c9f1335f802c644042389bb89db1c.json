    "description": "NiJi Heart is a strong and capable leader who wields the power of the heart beam Quasar. She is the head of CardHouse team and is known for her ability to fight in the front line and make strategic decisions. Her NiJi Pal, Memoni, is a magical being from a distant corner of the universe and serves as NiJi Heart's trusty companion. Together, they use the Heart Pearl Ring, a powerful weapon that can call forth the light of QuasaR from far-off spaces, to defend against their enemies. Despite her friendly and cute appearance, NiJi Heart should not be underestimated, as she will go to great lengths to bring her foes back to the path of goodness and cuteness.",
