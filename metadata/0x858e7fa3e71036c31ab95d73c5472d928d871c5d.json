    "description": "The desert witness a lot of cultures, celebrations, and people during the Pushkar festival every year. This young lady is a regular face in the desert during the festival. She dances in the desert representing her community and their culture. She is the face of her people. She travels to different cities, attend the festivals, and dances with a  wide floral skirt on. \nI don't really know whether it is her feet that moves with the wind or the wind itself dancing for the rhythm of her moves. Her art is her identity and She is the face of her community.\n\nEDITION : 1/1",
