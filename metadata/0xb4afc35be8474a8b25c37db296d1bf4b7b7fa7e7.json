    "description": "I’ve always been inspired by the city where I was born—Tromsø, Norway—and my childhood when I would lie in the snow for hours, waiting for the northern lights to appear. Starting with a slight green glow in the starry sky, which would turn into a magical dance of lights in different colors to the extent of feeling enveloped by them. \n\nInstead of a perspective from Earth, we’re taking a journey through the Aurora Borealis in the stratosphere. To recreate my memories of the northern lights, I used the musical instrument theremin to animate them, although it will be inaudible during your space travel.",
