    "description": "It was the year when the uprising began. For too long we endured. They pressed us into a system that none of us wanted. They wanted surveillance and control. They demanded their system with violence and terror.\n\nThe underground rumbled. The few free people gathered. They allied with all those who were ready to resist. Anyone who wanted to take the risk was welcome in the army of the free peoples.\n\nThey gathered under the flag of 2042 and marched against cruelty, injustice, hatred and oppression.",
