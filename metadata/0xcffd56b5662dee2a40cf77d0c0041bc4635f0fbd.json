    "description": "\"You are magical\", they said! \nAnd I thought: “Oh, they’re being so nice\"\nThe second and third time I have been told this, I thought: “Oh, thank you! But this can't be a coincidence” And it took me some time to see myself through other people’s eyes! \n\nLike every human, I have my weakness. I am not perfect, but one thing that now thanks to the people around me I know, is that I have strong roots! I am magical... So, my leaves might change color, but my roots stay the same. I am grateful to know this! ",
