    "description": "Butterfly Dream: The Maid's Illusion #1\" is the first piece in the \"The Maids' Dreams\" collection. This piece captures a moment of dreamlike reverie, where a maid is surrounded by an aura of butterflies.\n\nThe maid walked through the grand halls of the church, her mind lost in a dream. She couldn't help but feel as if she was floating, as if the weight of reality had been lifted off her shoulders. She closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the dream, surrounded by the fluttering of butterfly wings. They seemed to dance around her, their vibrant colors and delicate movements a reflection of her own dreamy state. The butterflies seemed to be a part of her dream, an extension of her imagination, and she couldn't help but feel that they were leading her to a place of wonder and beauty.",
