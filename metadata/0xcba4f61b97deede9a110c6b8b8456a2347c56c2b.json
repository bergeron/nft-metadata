    "description": "This Is Good is a journey into the blue and the unknown with the gut feeling as a compass. It reminds us of the beautiful moments in life and to listen to our gut feeling rather than fulfilling societal expectations: What feels good has to be good. \"This Is Good\" encourages us to let ourselves drift and sometimes be irrational.\n\nCover Design for the song This Is Good from the album \"Only in Arts\" by electronic/alternative duo whoiswelanski.\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/64BvTlTVkhxRhzoQgf3khF?si=c4a2d1d2eed4409d\n\nCover Design by Sandro Rybak\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sandroryry/\nhttps://twitter.com/Sandro_Ryry\n\nThe NFT comes with a high quality wav file and a vinyl of the Album \"Only in Arts\". The vinyl includes a poster with another redeemable NFT.",
