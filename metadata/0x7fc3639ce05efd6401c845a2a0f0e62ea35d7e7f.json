    "description": "Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit signals between nerve cells in the human brain. In AI processing, this term is often used by analogy to describe the flow of information between different parts of a neural network, similar to the neurotransmitters in the human brain. The flow of information in a neural network is important for optimal functioning. The goal is to create a network that can learn and adapt to new data, similar to the human brain. However, it is important to note that AI processing is not actually related to neurotransmitters, but rather a complex system of algorithms and mathematical models.\n\nDimensions: 1920x1080",
