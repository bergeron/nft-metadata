    "description": "“I Am You” came about from the collective minds of Julie Pacino, Parin, and Eden xo; three strong women who never shy away from expressing themselves. For Eden and Parin, a direct tie to their heritage in Iran, and the present day revolution was the catalyst for collaborating on the piece, which started off as a portrait taken by Julie. The present day murders, rapes and various forms of torture of women and the lgbtq+ community in Iran by their own government along with thousands of allies being unjustly imprisoned, many of whom are journalists, artists and like minded creative thinkers, cannot continue. We can’t hear them, but we feel them screaming inside. Our mission is to be a voice for the voiceless. After all, we are one, so say to yourself, “I am you”.",
