    "description": "To get this image, I entered an \"alt description\" of a movie still into an AI poetry generator. The results were not great at first, so I used the bits I liked and created a successive series of poems and images until I got the image above.\n\nThis 1/1 multimedia NFT contains a hidden poem that is only accessible to its owner. You can also discover the still frame that inspired this image, and see some of the \"outtakes\" that existed along the way.",
