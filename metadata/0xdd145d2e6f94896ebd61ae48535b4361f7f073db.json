    "description": "\"We have to use all 84,000 cells of our brain to its maximum capability. No computer can compare to our brains\" said the Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha.\n\nIn reality, we have more than 80,000 million brain cells inside our head.\n\nIt shows that the Prime Minister, a keen supporter of the royal family, is willing to spread false information without second thought. It also makes everyone curious about what is left under his 84,000 brain cells.",
