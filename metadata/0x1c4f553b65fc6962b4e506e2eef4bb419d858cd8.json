    "description": "The power and beauty of the West Australian southern ocean is unmatched, untamed and undeniably some of the most beautiful forms of ocean on the planet.\n\nThis wave lies on what feels like the edge of the world. Not a soul in sight and hours from land the ocean comes alive in the most glorious fashion. Huge southern ocean swells push up from storms in the Antarctic and smash along shallow limestone reefs. Alone with my camera, I'm blessed to capture these fleeting moments. ",
