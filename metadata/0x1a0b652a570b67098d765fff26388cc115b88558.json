    "description": "The journey begins at dawn in a distant forest. The sun had just begun its ascent, peeking over the horizon, painting the sky with hues of pink and orange, setting the stage for a new day. At the heart of this awakening is a modest creek, a hidden gem, around which the forest creatures gather for their morning gossip.\n\nIt begins to rain. Once gentle, the meandering stream swells with each mile, growing in character and purpose. Emerging from the forest, grazing animals dot the riverbed, encompassed by vibrant meadows and wildflowers.\n\nThe river continues its relentless march, encountering more rugged terrain, carving through valleys, cascading over jagged rocks and deep chasms, creating waterfalls. Dark clouds gather in the distance. Rumbles of thunder echo across the sky as the roaring river meets the waves of the sea in breathtaking relief: it is home. The sky's palette softens and the sun sets.\n\n🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊\n\nIn honor of Earth Day, 100% of proceeds from this drop will be donated to Ocean Conservancy.\n\nFormerly released in 2017, this was my first [and only] original soundtrack. I wrote it during a visit to Seoul while staying in my grandmother's modest apartment, a trip I made every few years. I wanted to capture the adventure of traveling to your home country and the satisfaction of arrival. I was also obsessed with BBC's Planet Earth series – our planet is alive, evolving, cyclical, incessant – all qualities I wanted the piece to embody.\n\nAs of April 22nd, 2023, this track boasts an impressive 495 plays on SoundCloud, 379 streams on Spotify, and $0 in royalties. When accounting for the opex of SoundCloud Pro and TuneCore, it's put me hundreds of dollars in the red to keep this track readily streamable. My dream is that one day, there will be a decentralized, programmable, and credibly neutral way to capture value when publishing music, perhaps through cryptographic proofs that can verify non-fungible ownership and authorship.\n\nOne day.  \n\nHappy 🌏 Day\nUplifted\n4.22.23",
