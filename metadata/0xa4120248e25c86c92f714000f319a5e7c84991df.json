    "description": "Ochre is a naturally occurring mineral ranging in colour from white to yellow to orange and red. These ochre pits, located approximately 500Km north of Adelaide in remote South Australia, were used by local Indigenous people for thousands of years and were even traded with other Indigenous groups across the Australian continent. This photograph taken by a drone is part of my series to showcase the vivid colours and geological formations from above.",
