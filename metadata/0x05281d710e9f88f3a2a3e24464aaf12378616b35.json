    "description": "The W3CR was inspired by the wisdom of Nature, its rhythmic cycling of growth and decay, which in turn enables new life to bloom. The W3CR envisions a world in which capital is expended freely to the cultural realm, supporting creators, artists and builders, so that human potential is cultivated. A living, closed-loop, generative ecosystem. Resident Creators d3mo, Kabuki & Entes collaborated on an exclusive NFT, “Seeding Creativity”, to honor the vision for the W3CR. ",
