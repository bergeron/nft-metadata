    "description": "This fantasy work I made which express a scene of underwater strange creatures take away the ordinary and beautiful water creatures that live in the sea, using some of bubbles to move to elsewhere through a huge spaceship hole. I concentrate on lighting of the scene and the composition itself to make the scene more realistic and complete.",
