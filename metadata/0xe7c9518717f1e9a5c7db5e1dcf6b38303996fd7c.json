    "description": "I will never forget the good feeling that morning when I took this photo.\nMy fingers were frozen and I was breathing cold air.\nIt was the beginning of a beautiful winter.\nYears have passed and I have not seen such a scene again.\nA single beautiful leaf on a branch of a tree.\nWhen something gets lonely becomes beautiful and shows its true self.\nI remember this quote:\nALL GREAT AND PRECIOUS THINGS ARE LONELY. (John Steinbeck)",
