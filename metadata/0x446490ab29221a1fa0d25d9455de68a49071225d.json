    "description": "Sometimes it feels like youâ€™re lost even when you know exactly where you are.\n\n\"Lost Here\" has been in the works for a while - I was working on my first project since being injured and reached out to Houndtrack to collab. We sent Carlie an early version of the instrumental to record on, and she literally wrote & recorded the vocals in two days. We ended up going back-and-forth countless times and eventually created a completely different instrumental & track that all three of us are super happy to share. \n\nThis track is a reminder to trust the process, even if it takes time.\n\nOut on all DSPs June 1st! <3",
