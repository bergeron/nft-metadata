    "description": "A time when life was more serene,\nA time where I did not need seen\nA sense of self, a sense of peace\nStress finally starts to release\n\nI feel nature, as it grounds me\nThe ferns, the creek, the trees around me\nIs this self care? Or so they say\nI'm still feeling kind of grey.\n\nThe creek, it crackles, as it flows\nUntangling knots from all my woes\nDoes healing have to feel so empty?\nBecause my vices truly tempt me\n\nI turn to nature, sometimes I run\nTo be alone, soak up the sun\nBut there's no shiny rays today\nBut it's self care, or so they say\n\nConvince myself to take a seat,\nThis moment here, was such a treat\n\"Cherish this view\" I tell myself\nFor I won't always have great health\n\nI thought there would be more to this,\nInstead it's numb in this abyss\nThis is self care, or so they say\nTime to survive, at least today.\n\n",
