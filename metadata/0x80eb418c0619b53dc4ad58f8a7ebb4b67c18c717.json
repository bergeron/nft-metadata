    "description": "An early morning boat ride out onto lake kerkini in Greece resulted in this beautiful high key black and white photograph. The sun was low and the lake had a milky haze kissing the surface. The cormorants were flying low over the surface getting ready for the day ahead. I knew immediately that this would work as high key black and white.",
