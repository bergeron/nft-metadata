    "description": "With their scarves wrapped tight around their necks, walking arm in arm, this was not the first storm they'd weathered together. They had grown up together; their parents were friends from school, had moved next door to each other, and had kids simultaneously. Their friendship was more than ordinary; it was true and everlasting. A little snow was nothing, having been through all significant moments in their lives together. They smiled under their masks and walked off into the night as they thought back to everything they had been through.",
