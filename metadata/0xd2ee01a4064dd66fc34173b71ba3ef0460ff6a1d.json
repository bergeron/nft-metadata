    "description": "The Suri tribes in Ethiopia place a great emphasis on family and community, with men being the protectors and guardians of their loved ones. Their commitment to protecting their children and women is unwavering, with a man's worth being measured by his ability to provide for and safeguard his family. In addition, Suri men play an active role in shaping their children's future, imparting skills and values necessary for them to become responsible adults. The tribe's strong sense of community involves sharing resources, knowledge, and skills, and collective effort to care for all members of the group. Through these values, the Suri has built a resilient culture that endures to this day.",
