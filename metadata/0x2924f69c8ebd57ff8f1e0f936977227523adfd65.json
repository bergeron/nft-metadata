    "description": "‘KT-DR1’ is a collaborative work pairing Keith Tucker’s audio with Damien Roach’s visuals. Taking Tucker’s otherworldly, futuristic sonics and its roots in the optimistic stargazing of Detroit Techno as a starting point, Roach’s imagery takes us on a 3 minute animated journey he calls ‘Abstract Sci-Fi’.  He describes the work as ‘hacking the aesthetic architecture of cinematic science fiction, like lens flares, chrome, and prismatic lighting, and rerouting it towards a dreamlike, non-narrative form’. ‘KT-DR1’ connects the dots between these two artists' practices in a futuristic, transatlantic, cross-generational first. \n\n\nVisuals: Damien Roach\nAudio: Keith Tucker\nTitle: KT-DR1\nDate: 2022\nFormat: MP4 \nDimensions: 640 x 360 px\nDimensions of full spec file: 1920 x 1080 px\nDuration: 3:00\nUnique Edition 1/1\n\nThe owner will be able to receive the MP4 with full spec encoding.
