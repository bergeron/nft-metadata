    "description": "Unique 1124 x 1950 px loop, generated on march 16th 2023 1:49 pm.\nThis system was originally created with my (back then) 11 year old daughter. We sketched around with a pencil and envisioned a tile-based pattern system that we could produce as physical stamps. Which we did as well, by the way.  We started with 5 straight lines and then went with the most basic variations we could think of.  Then I had to play around with it using my favorite procedural design tool pattern nodes.",
