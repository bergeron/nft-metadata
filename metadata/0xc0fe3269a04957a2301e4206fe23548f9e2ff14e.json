She's the only holder of the traits from all the 6 clans that are: fire, water, flower, spirit faction, hidden faction and cyborg and therefore is the most powerful of all. She can heal the deepest wounds and charm the toughest souls. She protects the forestverse till the eternity.\n\nThis is a special edition fanart created as a homage to 'We Are Itsuki' family. It is a traditional mixed media artwork created using color pencils, acrylics and brushmarkers on 210 gsm paper.",
