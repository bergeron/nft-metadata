    "description": "This baby bird had followed me around all afternoon while i was working in the yard. Eventually I lost sight of it and figured it had found its mom or siblings but when I went around back I found it just perched on a wire. I grabbed my camera from inside and tried to capture it as best as possible with the remaining light. I hope you enjoy this piece and I look forward to whomever buys it! ",
