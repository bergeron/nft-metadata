    "description": "It was the first concert in Colombia of the foo fighters, 2015. I went to the hotel where they were staying. I waited a few hours, until they came out to take pictures with people and sign autographs except Dave Grohl. They were very nice, with the people who were waiting for them. \n\nOn March 25, 2022 Taylor Hawkins died at the age of 50 in a room at the Casa Medina hotel in Bogota, the capital of Colombia.  The band was touring South America at the time of the incident and was scheduled to perform at the Estéreo Picnic Festival in Bogotá that same night.\n\nIMG_7661\n5184 px * 3232px\n\n1/1",
