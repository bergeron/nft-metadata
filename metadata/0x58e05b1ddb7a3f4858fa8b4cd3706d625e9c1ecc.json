    "description": "I start my collection with \"sinkholes\". Receding salt water leaves behind underground salt deposits. Runoff from periodic rains dissolves the salt patches. Without support, land above collapses. Sometimes, they are filled with water afterwards. \n \nThis enormous sinkhole looks like a crooked mirror. Above - human impact, drowning land. At reflection - nature ruins and devastation. \n\nPhoto 5101  x  7652\nLocation - Dead Sea\nUnique 1/1 NFT edition",
