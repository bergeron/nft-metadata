    "description": "#1 - Curves, Perfect Moment\n\nLocation: Mont St. Michel, Normandie, France.\n \nHad the opportunity to visit this place four times and the last time was finally the one I got an incredible sunny day. All three times before was raining! But this day, were some clouds on the sky. The temperature was amazing. I walked around all day searching for new perspectives. Actually I wanted to find water paths that would lead to Mont St. Michel. Wasn't easy but when I discovered these curves....couldn't believe in the image I was seeing. That was the perfect moment! As a photographer these are the moments I pursue with passion and share with love!\n",
