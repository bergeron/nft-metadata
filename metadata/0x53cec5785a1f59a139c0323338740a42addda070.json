    "description": "This work was created as a piece that symbolizes the world constantly throwing shade and trying to bring us down. However, it is up to us to decide if we accept the defeat or if we choose to rise above it and proved them wrong. I hope this piece encourages you to take what is thrown at you and use it to grow. We are gonna change if we want to or not, the world will make sure of that. We get to decide if that is for the better or worse. Let's make a difference. Always Delta.",
