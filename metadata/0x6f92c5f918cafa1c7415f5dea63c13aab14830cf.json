This file represents the design for the User Profile as seen in the very first version.  In this version, the Profile page displayed the Deeds that were done by the user, the users followers/following, and the ability to sort Deeds by date or popularity.  In this version, every Deed had a title as well, which can be seen in the list of Deeds on the users profile.",
