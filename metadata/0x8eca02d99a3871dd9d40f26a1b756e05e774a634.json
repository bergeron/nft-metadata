    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a mecha named Colossus. Despite being a massive machine, Colossus had a kind heart and a curious nature.\nOne day, Colossus was exploring a meadow when it stumbled upon a group of small, fluffy creatures. They were hesitant at first, but Colossus' gentle demeanor quickly won them over.\n\nAs Colossus spent more time with the creatures, it discovered that they were in danger. A nearby factory was polluting their home and making it difficult for them to survive.\n\nDetermined to help, Colossus came up with a plan. It used its incredible strength to move the factory away from the meadow and found a way to filter the polluted air.\n\nThanks to Colossus' efforts, the meadow was saved, and the fluffy creatures could live happily ever after. From that day on, Colossus visited the meadow regularly to check on its new friends and ensure their home was safe.\n\nMade in VR with Adobe Medium + Blender",
