    "description": "Would you willingly choose to travel to Alaska in the heart of winter when there's only six hours of daylight and -30 degree temperatures? \n\nThis is exactly what I chose to do last winter. The Cabin was anything but daunting in reality. The warm crackle of a fire place to keep away the arctic chill, a hot cup of tea to warm my soul, and a classic adventure novel to pass the long dark nights alone made for a truly happy and magical experience.\n\nThis photo was taken at the Hatcher Pass Lodge in Alaska during December of 2021. I was completely frozen to the core with it being -27 degrees outside, but the cold will always be worth when doing what brings you joy. This photo brings me so much joy because I often feel unhappy and overwhelmed by the stresses of life and simply viewing it and reading \"HAPPY\" let me know that everything will be alright.",
