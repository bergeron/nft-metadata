    "description": "A product of our imagination, a dream, an illusion, a reality.\n\nIt all started in our homeland Argentina when a friend realized we were eating a crazy amount of onions on a daily basis.\n\nHe called our home ‚ÄúThe Onion House‚Äù.\n\nWhen we decided to have a nomad life, we felt comfortable leaving our house behind, but not the onion; so it came with us.\n\nWe made this drawing with pencil and ink while living in the wintery Seoul (South Korea) back in 2018; and we painted it 4 years later immersed in the intense heat of Koh Phangan, Thailand.\n\nThe pandemic gave us the pause to appreciate it and to see the onion‚Äôs (and our) potential.\n\nFor us, this new version symbolizes the end of an era and the beginning of a new one - full of nonsense as this story, we hope.\n\n\nThe Nomad Onion üßÖ\nMixed media: Chinese ink + digital painting \nby @florcebolla & @juancasini\nThailand, 2022",
