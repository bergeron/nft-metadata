    "description": "This NFT is a 1/1 of the official lyric video of ‘Just ‘Say It’ featuring Helen Tess.  \n\nThis track is very special to me not only because it’s the first release in a close to 10-month hiatus, but also because I had the opportunity to work with my amazing friend Helen Tess. The song is about those on and off relationships, those relationships where people know they don’t want to be there but are just too afraid to say it. It’s those toxic relationships where people want to pull away but remain there out of comfort and fear. It relates to me because I’ve been personally in that situation and I hope that people can relate to it too.  \n\nFilm, art and animation by Alex Gilbeaux (@alex.gilbeaux)  \n\n*Includes unlockable content.  \n\nThe owner of this NFT will receive: \n\n- The .wav master audio file \n- The .mp4 of the lyric video\n - The .jpeg artwork file\n - ‘Just Say It’ phone backgrounds \n- Access to \"collector\" channels in my discord.\n - Token airdrop (coming soon) \n- VIP +1 tickets to any Charlie Crown headline show.  \n\nThank you so much for your support, this is just the beginning!",
