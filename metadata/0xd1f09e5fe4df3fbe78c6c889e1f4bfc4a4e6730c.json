The state built it to appease the citizens who were rampaging, from their own inaction - they succeeded. Afterwards, they simply locked and froze the facility, the living quarters were no longer needed, and after a while they fell into disrepair.  \nThe walls became rusty and in some places there were holes through which the gusty wind blew in, the floors were stained with strange sludge, and the last unbroken panes were in the window frames.",
