There was a lot of social pressure on \"Colibri\" because of her uselessness in the colony. She dropped her hands and wished to commit suicide. While searching for a beautiful place for her suicide, she found a grove of mysterious flowers. She was so struck by the place that she quickly ran to the base to share her mysterious find. It turned out that the plants' pink pollen is a drug, but it also has extremely useful properties for generating electricity. Along with the promising discovery of a new kind of energy source for the colony, the girl also created the problem of an affordable drug for the colonists. Thus, a new era of pink fever in the colony's history was inaugurated.",
