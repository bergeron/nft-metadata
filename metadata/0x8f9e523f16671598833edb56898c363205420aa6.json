    "description": "We've all heard the legends of creatures of folklore and imagination who inhabit the most remote regions of our world; still clinging to the 'old ways'. Beings who once walked among us but have since fled our presence as we give our minds over to technology and our bodies to a false normal. Maybe there's still a way for us to coexist and learn from each other. Maybe we aren't too far gone. Maybe they are simply lying in wait- anticipating our inevitable self fulfilled extinction.",
