    "description": "I Integrate artificial intelligence into photographic work that Bernd and Hilla Becher have done for over five decades.\nUsing photography as a language and the camera as a tool, Bernd and Hilla Becher, like August Sander, visually consummated the Zeitgeist of the obsessive search for an archetype where something of the Human transcends and extends into the construction of contemporary culture.\nThrough Deep Lerning,  generate the essential field of this work. The result contains a field of multiple and, at the same time, unique latent images that transcend the blunt realism of the sources in forms that could be identified like auras.\nWe can say that my work begins where the field of photography ends.\n What could we deduce then, from this technology capable of equalizing the spirit typifying his work and casting disturbing images of a deformity recognizable?. . Is it perhaps the rescue of the auratic experience could thus still be possible even in this digital age",
