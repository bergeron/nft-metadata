    "description": "Benjamin Franklin was a large advocate for hemp. He explained that it was a more sustainable and renewable resource than other crops, and once famously declared “Hemp is not only profitable but necessary.” \n\nThis is my reimagining of a world where Benjamin was an advocate for hemp for its recreational properties. So much so, that in this world, it’s earned him the moniker “Benjamin Danklin”.\n\n3000px x 2000px ",
