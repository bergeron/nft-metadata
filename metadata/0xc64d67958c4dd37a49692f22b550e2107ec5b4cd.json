    "description": "This photograph has been taken in Cabo de las Huertas, Alicante, Spain. For this purpose, a Canon 5D Mark III camera and a 10-stop neutral density filter were used. It is one of the most beautiful and wild areas of the Alicante area. In some areas we can find some stairs to access the sea as shown in the photograph. Someone told me once that my photographs always have something poetic about them, I hope this is one of them. ",
