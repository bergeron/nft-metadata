You’d said goodbye,\nHalted by the fear.\n\nAnd yet you try, you had to bat an eye \nAt every gust of cheer.\n\nShe’s like a cloud,\nOncoming bout,\nA hope that seems so near.\n\nYou walk disarmed,\nA net cast on a chance,\nThe wind was not so dear.\n\nIt made its way,\nIt wouldn’t let her stay\nThe candle smokes into the darkness,\nBut who could tell?\n\nNow she’s gone, you are back to stone,\nYour cloud girl blew away...",
