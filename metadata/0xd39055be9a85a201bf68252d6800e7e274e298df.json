    "description": "MATERIAL: A compilation of digital paint & vector art\nSIZE: 5400*7200px\nTHE MAIN USED ELEMENTS: Demoiselle Crane, Yellow Merinque Flower, Protea Flower.\n\nCrane bird's are large birds & humans don't domesticate  or keep them as pets, that means a \"free specter\". those are symbolic of luck & longevity. the main message of this power animal is \"Dance & Pass (in your way through life)\".\nThis NFT is my first NFT member in the Bird Garden collection and I have decided to develop and continue it. My main subject is the depiction of long-tailed birds in real-world landscapes full of flowers and plants, each symbolizing a concept with a very ancient background and history. Thank you for supporting and watching this work.\n\n",
