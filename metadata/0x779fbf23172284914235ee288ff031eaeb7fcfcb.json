    "description": "\nThis is an expression of how beautiful the female body is.\n\nHere we explored and I captured my muse standing in front of a blank canvas. Telling a story of her being the work of art, we painted, we laughed and we enjoyed expressing ourselves in this moment.\n\nWhat a work of art. This composition is different, it's me, and my vision. \n\nNot what normal is like for others, but what is normal and acceptable for me. In my eyes I see this masterpiece we created and I am grateful that I get to create this with the help of others.\n\nThis is the first of the series, Art is Female, where I will continue to express the beauty that is a woman.",
