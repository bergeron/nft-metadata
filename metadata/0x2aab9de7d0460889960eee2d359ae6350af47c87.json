    "description": "Do you think if you come face to face with an alien, you'll know it's an alien? Of course, you wonâ€™t.\n\nThey have learned to be invisible among humans, to hide carefully during the day and not to expose body parts at night, so it is a priori difficult to meet an alien.\n\nNevertheless, even if you meet an alien you are unlikely to be able to quickly distinguish it from an ordinary person. But if you look closely, you will notice an unnatural blackness of eyes, some stiffness of movements and taciturnity.\n\n1/1 NFTs",
