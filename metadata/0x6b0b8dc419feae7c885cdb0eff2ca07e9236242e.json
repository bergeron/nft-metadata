    "description": "While the world is running towards Artificial Intelligence and robots are said to take over the world in near future, I am visualising a world that humans will be the ones living in peace and freedom with power in their hands. These series will be presenting humans control over robots, humans living in freedom and beauty in a true world, and robots weakened and fighting to live.\nHumans' freedom, love and life is what I dream of. Robots will not overtake our lives.",
