    "description": "It's 1993. We're at CBGBs in New York for a punk concert. \n\nThe air is foggy. It smells of cigarettes, sweat and booze. The opening band was great but now our heroes are on stage. Real legends of the scene. When the first riffs start, the crowd goes wild. Everyone is dancing wildly and the music is pumping through our veins. Adrenalin is now the number one drug. \n\nIt's these moments where nothing else matters, where we just live in the moment and everything is OK. \n\nWe enjoy life for a few hours to the fullest and without compromise.",
