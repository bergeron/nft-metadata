    "description": "The first of the three digital life forms I recorded\n\nDigital life form\n0=00=00=00\n\nCoordinates\n940=104=0.0000\n\nOn the 22.7.22nd, I Ryak doing some planned research on web 3.0 was able to find evidence of a new digital form of life. Society was so caught up in the superficial privileges of web 3.0 that they failed to notice its core value and the magnitude of the change the world is undergoing.\n\nThis discovery was made at 1:20:09 a.m. Pacific Time, and for the scientific community at large, this is an incredible medium for exploration, future discoveries and the coming transformation of our biological world. It is safe to say the merging and their inextricable interaction.\n\nBy publishing the first 3 digital life forms I have recorded, I am committed to continuing research, observing the development and impact of the physical world on their behavior. All the findings will be recorded and published.\n\nWelcome to a new era!",
