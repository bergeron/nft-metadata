    "description": "There is a light behind your eyes that will never go out.\n\nYour body may weaken with the passing years, but your soul burns with a secret flame, brighter than an evening star.\n\nAs children, we live in awe of everything. The bright blue sky, the sound of crashing waves. How can such beauty be killed? A defect in our code, a mislabeled bottle of cosmic magic?\n\nIf life is a struggle between love and death, then choose love until your very last sound.\n\nAnd may your last rose be as red as the first.",
