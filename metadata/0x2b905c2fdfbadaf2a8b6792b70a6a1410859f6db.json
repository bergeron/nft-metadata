    "name": "Les EtherRock de Tungsten",
    "description": "Many myths surround the EtherRock.\n\nWhere did it come from? What makes up its dense constitution?\n\nBehold the moment the mother rock fell to the seas, crowned by the great Tungsten cube from which all other Tungsten cubes were formed. Today these cubes represent the tension between the weight of the physical world and the ephemerality of our Metaverse.\n\nThe density of the mother rock is so great that the fabric of the Metaverse is warped along with it. We celebrate this distortion, the source of all that is dank.",
