    "description": "Adversity and challenges come in many ways and in many forms. As every motivational speaker would tell you, what matters is how you face them and the determination to overcome them. This is what the three artworks in the “Let’s Dance” series explore.\nThe expression “Let’s Dance” is often used as a call to challenge in combat sports. Obviously, the first piece in the series shows a boxer dressed in an unconventional way and ready to go. Beyond the plain-to-see idea of boxing as a challenge, I use the unconventional dressing as a visual metaphor to point out what this individual is actually up in arms about – a hypocritical society that judges unconventional people.\n\n[See 'Let's Dance II' for a continuation]",
