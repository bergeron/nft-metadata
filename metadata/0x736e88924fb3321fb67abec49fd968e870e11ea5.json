    "description": "This addition to the Adventurous Art NFT collection was created by artist Daniel Eskridge, an artist whose illustrations appear in magazines, newspapers, on book covers, and in science and history museums.\n\nBad weather approaches over a marshy wetland while mists rise from the ground. In the midst of this scene, a white horse wearing an empty saddle rears up over the long swaying grass.  The wind that heralds the coming storm blows through the animal's dark mane and tail as it searches desperately for its lost rider\n\nFrom the artist: I originally created this horse to be part of a larger scene where it had a rider, but I like the horse's pose so much that I felt the rider was actually more of a distraction.  So, I decided to depict the animal alone.  Though I started this as a still scene, I felt it needed more, I included the animated elements to add to the drama of the scene.\n\nEnjoy,\nDaniel Eskridge\n",
