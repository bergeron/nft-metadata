    "description": "This is a part of the first set of NFTs by the Fearless Collective.\n\nArtist \nMadiha Khan + The Fearless Collective\n\nOver the last few years, vocal and assertive Muslim women have woken up in India to find their names on Auctioning apps - from Sulli Deals to Bulli Bai, being lathi charged, locked up in jails, harassed and much more. Efforts are continuously made to dehumanise, discourage and remove them from all spaces- from schools and workplaces, to social media.  This portrait highlights the fierceness, power of Maliha, a young Muslim woman and was made as a step towards reclaiming the virtual spaces that are being snatched from women like her.\n",
