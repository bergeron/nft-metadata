    "description": "On a cold winter day I walk deep into the forest, the sound of dry leaves under my footsteps. A blustery breeze chills my face, my gaze raises to the tree boughs above me twisting in the wind and to my delight snow begins to fall, snowflakes the size of quarters stick to my face. Let it snow let it snow.",
