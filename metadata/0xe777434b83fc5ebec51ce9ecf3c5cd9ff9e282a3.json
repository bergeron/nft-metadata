    "description": "\"Tempus Fugit\"  is an artwork that commemorates my journey in NFTs starting from 2022. Time flies and I'm so happy with my results this year. For once I feel satisfied with myself and now I'm even more inspired to create. \n\nThis artwork was also given as a POAP to all my collectors of 2022.  \nTruly thankful to everyone who supported, shared, liked and collected my art! Please stay tuned for more art in 2023!\n\nDigital painting by Eva Eller  \n2022",
