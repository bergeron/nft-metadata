    "description": "I've always wondered why, if this is such a marvel of German engineering, it's named after a Spanish word, \"Carrera.\" \nHowever, if you simply say race or, as it is said in German, Rennen, that reminds you of something routine, even cold, whereas if you say it in Spanish, that conjures up images of excitement and warmth in Spanish life, that evokes memories of joy, of always having a smile on your face and being emotional...\nThat is precisely what 911 is. A car that you don't just drive, but that you enjoy, that tends to put a smile on your face even when you're racing, even when it's as angry as an animal... That is why it is called Carrera rather than Race...\n911 Carrera S.\nIt's digital painting based on a true image taken by myself. ",
