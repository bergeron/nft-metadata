    "description": "Our bodies are our only true home.\nWe hope that one day weâ€™ll embrace every part of it.\nWhat we wear and how we wear it brings us closer to that hope.\nThe hope that takes away your lust to rape us and shame us.\nThe lust that moves you to label and divide us.\nWe lust for a world free from your eyes.\nThe eyes that hope to get a peek up our skirt",
