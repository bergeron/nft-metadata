    "description": "Zoo is an unexpected series, where the surreal embracing reality, nature meeting artificial form. Zoo is a series in which the place and the subject merge, managing to be both protagonists.\nThe place is Armani/Silos, an old barn from the 50's renovated by Giorgio Armani as a temple of design and fashion. A place where everything that is extra is superfluous, where there is only one rule, that of absolute geometric rigor. The lines are rigid, the interiors essential and minimalist, geometry is the great queen of Armani/Silos and it is in this place that I have chosen to place my animals. A place opposed to the laws of nature, built by man for man, placing inside a rhino, a panda but also a giraffe and other animals of the savannah and the jungle, which should not be here, in a house that is not theirs, where they can only hide, as if they were in a Zoo in front of visitors.",
