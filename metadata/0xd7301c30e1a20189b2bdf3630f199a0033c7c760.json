    "description": "“Ladies’ Lair Lake - Red Handed” (video), 2022 (TRT: 2:20 Min) is an excerpt from a feature length video entitled “Ladies’ Lair Lake” by multimedia artist Trulee Hall.\n\n“Ladies’ Lair Lake” is a musical based on an original libretto and score written by Hall which narrates a creation myth. The mythological narrative takes place in an edenic forest setting, beside a lake inhabited by a sorority of nymphs overseen by a benevolent yet mischievous goddess. The sisterhood, chameleon-like and at one with their surroundings, coexists in harmony with nature, adopting the characteristics and appearance of water, land, and flora.\n\nThe video incorporates a variety of techniques and mediums, including CGI, claymation puppetry, green screen, found nature footage, live action, painted dimensional sets and newly composed music alongside a choir.\n\nRed Handed is chapter 10 of 14 that comprised the “Ladies’ Lair Lake” installation presented by Los Angeles Nomadic Division (LAND) in Los Angeles, CA February 16 - March 27, 2022 where viewers were invited to walk through Hall’s universe by engaging with its characters through labyrinthine rooms of sculpture, video, and painting.\n\nRed Handed features three green female marionette characters Hall calls “Window Watcher 1 and 2” and a third character called “Mom.” The Window Watchers sing a song narrating a conflict.\n\nOriginally the Red Handed video chapter was shown in the context of a site specific installation that featured puppets and a painted backdrop.\n\nComplete documentation for “Ladies’ Lake Lair - Red Handed” can be found in the following K-Spec: https://kspec.io/assets/0xd7301c30E1A20189b2bDf3630f199a0033C7c760/1",
