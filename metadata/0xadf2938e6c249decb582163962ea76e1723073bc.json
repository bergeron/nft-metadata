    "description": "God of Fire also known as Kandaran Kelan Theyyam in Traditional words in Kerala, India. \nTheyyam is a performing art ritual conducted in families/ family temples in the northern part of Kerala, India and has originated about 1500 years ago. The art form involves fierce make up, head gear and fire during performance and is considered as a form of worship to the particular deity of the temple/ the main god of the tribe/ family that follows the same.  \nIn this Kandaran Kelan Theyyam, the artists wear makeup, headgear and dance according to the rhythm of drums and cymbals. The final act happens, when the artist jumps several times through the pyre of fire and transforms into demi god and blesses the devotees.  \nI have captured this image in March 2022 at Kannur, Kerala.\n\nArtist: Shreenivas Yenni  \nMedium: Photography  \nEdition: 15  \nLocation: Kannur, Kerala, India  \nCamera used: Fujifilm XT-3  \nYear: 2022  \nDimensions: 6000 X 4000\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
