    "description": "matt (hastings) is such a talented young artist who we've become close friends with. this song was written in a session we did together in nashville with seth ennis earlier this year, and it's the only song on the EP that we co-wrote from scratch! we love working on amazing toplines that are sent to us by songwriter friends of ours, but this one has a special place for us because of the way it came together so naturally with matt.\n",
