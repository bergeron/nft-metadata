    "description": "It took me months to come up with this song. I started at the beginning of the pandemic and could not finish it. Over the years, I have come back from time to time and continued to work.\n\nThis song is about:\nHow our lives were turned upside down in a moment.\nHow we wanted to escape.\nHow fragile we are.\nHow we lost our loved ones.\nHow we couldn't breathe and talk.\nHow we didn't want to see what happened.\nHow we are haunted in our neighborhood.\nHow did we go crazy.\nHow our world became a boring empty place.\nHow did we end up alone.",
