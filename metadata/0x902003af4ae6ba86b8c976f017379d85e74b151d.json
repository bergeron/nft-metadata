    "description": "Honey hibiscus is the genesis piece of the \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\" series.\n\nIt's hard to put into words exactly what \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\" means to me but I know that it is a deeply personal.  Most certainly it is about being a women and the balancing act we preform in our public and private spaces. The floral centrepiece and the nude are objects of beauty and desire, representations of the domestic and the sexual. Combining the two both destroys and reconciles those representations, so that we can examine the social hierarchies that restrict and simplify our understanding of what it means to be a women.\n\nHibiscus flower meanings include ephemeral beauty, romantic love, friendship, hospitality, and joy.",
