    "description": "The animated version of my original abstract painting titled Mad Eye.\n\nThe original painting was crafted with acrylic and oil pastel on an 18x24 stretched canvas, and then photographed and transformed into a unique animation using Photoshop layers.\n\nThe creative process behind this artwork can be viewed in a behind-the-scenes video available on Mylesâ€™ social media pages. Follow @333myles.art to see the artist's journey from canvas to animation.\nMad Eye animation is a one-of-a-kind NFT that represents the artist's creative process and passion for pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms. This NFT is a perfect addition to any digital art collection and a rare opportunity to own a piece of the artist's legacy.\n",
