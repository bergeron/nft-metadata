    "description": "We give what we have inside.\n\nThrough the path of her eyes, she can connect with our inner voice.\n\nAnd as she walks through life, the strength of her spirit travels within bridges built with love. Seeing beyond, she can reach our hearts to awaken the great treasure of communication, the universal understanding of helping out of love, of growing and honoring our path.\n\nWhat is done with love heals, and enhances the meaning of life.\n\nThis oil painting is dedicated to the inner strength, the will to live, help and heal. We can be the change makers, give a message with creativity, spreading and sharing all the goodness in your way: the gift to have the chance to be an example of mankind in your actions that honors life: Make it art.  \n\nFrom the total proceeds from NFT sales and the original oil painting, 99 % will go directly to the @todosconemmita foundation.\n",
