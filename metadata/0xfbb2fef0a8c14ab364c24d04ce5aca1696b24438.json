    "description": "One of my very favorite days of photography was 1.26.22. This is one of my favorite images that I have ever captured. It is a single frame from a DJI Mavic Drone. \n\nThe bridge coated in fog is the St. Johns bridge in Portland, Oregon, USA. When I became interested in photography I began a love affair with this bridge that I am sure will last the rest of my life. It is a 400 foot tall suspension bridge in North Portland, Oregon and is famous across the country for its signature look. \n\nConditions like this are extremely rare around where I live. This image required being at the right place, at the right time with the right gear and to date, I have not seen one from this day that exists. It is an obvious choice for my first piece that I am offering to the public. It is perfect for any lover of bridges, atmospheric conditions, or of Portland, OR. ",
