    "description": "This series reflectsÂ two themes:\n1. Natural beauty is one of the longings of the soul. Yet, in the age of unnaturalness real beauty seems boring and dull.\n2. When humans and nature collide, often, only one side emerges victorious.\n\nThrough my works, I wish to demonstrate that the union of people and nature can and should be simple and harmonious.\n\nI explore the human body and the nature of things, in an aura of pure sunlight and water.\n\n1/10",
