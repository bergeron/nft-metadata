    "description": "An ode to the proposal that launched it all.\n\nThe Ministry of Wizard Doodles is a decentralized autonomous organization whose members are the 74 wizard Doodle owners.\nOwning a wizard Doodle makes you an inextricable member of the Ministry. Membership into the Ministry transfers with the Doodle. \nThe Ministryâ€™s mission is to gather all wizards under one brand and to distribute services, products and experiences to consumers and brands looking to participate in the Doodles universe.\n\nApproved and distributed by the Ministry of Wizard Doodles (@WizzyMinistry). Resale supports the wizards.",
