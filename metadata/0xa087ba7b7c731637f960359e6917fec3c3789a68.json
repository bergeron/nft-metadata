    "description": "Takeo belongs to the clan of elite warriors protecting their sacred land from invaders and trespassers. Throughout generations this clan has lived deep in the forest under the protection of Kugunochi, the Spirit of trees. Each warrior is held upon the responsibility to look after the clan and stand against any invaders or trespassers with impure hearts. The whereabouts of their village is still a mystery but they are always present looking at people who wander into their land from distance.",
