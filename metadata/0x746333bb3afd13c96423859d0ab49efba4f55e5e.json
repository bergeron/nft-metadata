    "description": "1/1 Edition\n\nThis design has been the personal symbol of the artist Michael Strauss for over 15 years. \n\n12 white hexagons surround 6 blue hexagons, with a black void in the center - forming a stylized eyeball.\n\nRepresenting inner vision, divine order, and the belief that consciousness resides within all elements of nature; it is meant to evoke The All-Seeing Eye and the ancient talisman of protection against the \"Evil Eye\".\n\nThe sacred geometrical form is based on Metatron’s Cube and the Star Tetrahedron. This is the basis of the pattern known as the “Grid of Life\", the masculine equivalent to the Flower of Life.\n\nThis same arrangement of hexagons is now known as the iconic “golden mirror array” of the James Webb Space Telescope - our newly awakened eye in the cosmos.\n\nShowing the perfect match of geometry and inverted colors of the two designs, a union of opposites is formed between these universal icons of outer space discovery and inner space exploration. \n\nmp4 | 3840x2160 | 60fps",
