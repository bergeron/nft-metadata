    "description": "Fractalism is a style of art that uses either fractal formulas fractal objects or techniques to form images. Most of this work begins as abstract piecess that I examine in an effort to find representational images within the fractals.  Once i see something recognizable I work on the piece to pull illusions out of obscurity. Not all of my fractalism work is representational but the idea in the work is that as the viewer looks, he or she will hopefully find something beyond the obvious.",
