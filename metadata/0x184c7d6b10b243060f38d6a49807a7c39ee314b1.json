    "description": "Fifty Decades to Visit Before You Die is a long-term photography series: part self-portrait project, part time-travellers’ guide to the past. How can you understand what living through history was like unless you book yourself a ticket and find out? \n\nDressed as historical figures or blending in as time-travelling tourists, I make my passport photograph and depart. One thing I’ve noticed is that history repeats itself time and again. In the good, the bad, and in fashion. Trends arrive, disappear, and then in some form or another back around they come. \n\nAs I watched patterns emerge, I began making my GIFs. Turning my passport photographs as historical characters into moving portraits that shift from one decade to the next and back again. On an endless loop.\n\n80s/90s was the first GIF to ever be included in my project and the first to be publicly exhibited (as part of Inside Job, a group show at Tate Modern in 2019).\n",
