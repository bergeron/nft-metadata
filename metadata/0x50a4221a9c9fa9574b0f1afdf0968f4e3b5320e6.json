    "description": "Slowpy is a spy for evil forces, but we think it may have been hired through nepotism or maybe snailpotism, otherwise who would hire a not-so-bright, super-slow, and usually-scared creature for a spy position?!\n\nSlowpy is suspicious, nosy, and curious. It tries to see what others are doing, and sometimes tries to be scary, but usually fails.\n\nSlowpies usually hide on top of the walls or in the maze corners, communicating with each other via screamy noises, and hide in their shells as soon as they see a movement.\n\nTo Mint from this collection, you will need a RAM Gen 1 or RAM Gen 2 NFT Membership that hasnâ€™t already minted from this collection.
