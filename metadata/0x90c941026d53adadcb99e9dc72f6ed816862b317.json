    "description": "Milky NFT is a collection of 10,000 randomly generated milky characters that you can find in your local Ethereum grocery store. Every carton is unique and rare in its own way (but some are rarer than other!). In the process of our roadmap activation your Milky fren will double as a membership pass to our DAO, where you will be able to vote for future projects and activities. Milky NFT project is strongly focused on growth, great art and building a passionate community. Our goals are high and our love for what we do is even higher! Join us on the journey through the dairy isle and maybe a couple more ;) Join the community in our Discord and Twitter!",
