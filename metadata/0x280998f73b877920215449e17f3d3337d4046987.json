    "description": "On this day, I decided to randomly wander the streets of the city of Tual (Kei Islands, Maluku, Indonesia). I don't know the name of the man I encountered in this shot. But, one thing I've noticed over and over again is that people are often eager to show off their newborn babies, giving the impression that the greatest pride in life comes from the early days of a new one.",
