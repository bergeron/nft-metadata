    "description": "A crisp, autumnal evening within the Cairngorms National Park.\nAfter roaming through the winding roads of the national park, we finally reached our destination in the late afternoon, as the golden light began its magic over Loch Morlich. With glass-like conditions, the moment was made even more perfect when a lone kayak entered the frame of my photograph, as they made their way towards the sun.\nA moment that will forever be etched in my mind.",
