    "description": "It has always been a fascinating challenge to me as an artist, visually exploring that in between space in dreams, where the scenery seems to shift and move while merging with color and feeling across landscapes and scenes that never quite stay the same. One could say this is the signature of my artistic style, fusing abstraction, landscape, still life, and figurative in segmented and expressionist ways in an effort to mimic a world unseen except in the depths of our sleep."
