    "description": "What happens when the global Netflix sensation “Squid Game,” celebrated pixel artist Joo Jae-bum, and CoinDesk Korea’s annual conference DAXPO all come together at the same spot?\n\nCoinDesk Korea hosted DAXPO 2021 from Nov. 15 to 16 at the Paradise Hotel Busan. Joo took the stage on the second day. Joo’s mission was to demonstrate the process of creating pixel art in real time. Upon receiving a request for something related to “Squid Game,” Joo went to work. \n\nWithin 10 minutes, the audience was granted a preview of Joo’s latest work, Young-hee.\n\nSince then, there’s been much anticipation as to when Joo will release his rendition of Young-hee as an NFT. That time is now. \n\nYoung-hee isn’t just another piece of fan art. It captures the moment when Joo worked his craft in front of a live audience during DAXPO 2021, South Korea’s most important blockchain conference. The owner of the NFT will effectively own both Joo’s art and the special moment in which the creation was born.",
