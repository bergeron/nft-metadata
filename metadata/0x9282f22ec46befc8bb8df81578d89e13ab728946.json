    "name": "The origin of vital energy",
    "description": "The “Material” has several connotations - substance, matter, fabric and data. This work is an attempt to return to my childhood fantasies about the existence of parallel worlds where everything works differently. People live and interact with each other due to the strength and power of material. It is a metaphor for the nature and basic of life. It embodies the vital energy and helps people to live.\n\nWe find ourselves in the surreal world of dreams and fantasies and try to answer the question “children's fantasies are one of the forms of escapism or an attempt to find ourselves?”",
