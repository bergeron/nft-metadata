    "description": "Oh, she was broken, scarred by blades of betrayal\nShe was lost, not knowing who she was anymore\nHer insecurities had drowned her daily.\nShe was scared to look in the mirror.\nShe was scared of what she'll find there in.\nUntil love found her, she dances around in darkness.\nLove healed her, it sealed her wounds, strengthened her heart\nShe never would be who she was \nBut she loves the new version of her ; Scarred, yet whole\nHer flaws made her stronger.",
