    "description": "Life is fragile, isn't it? And how fragile is life on the little blue ball called Earth, on whom does this fragile world depend?  Have you ever thought that it may soon cease to exist? One more catastrophe makes you involuntarily think that at any moment, when you least expect it, your life can be ended, and it will be caused not by some external threat, but by us - people. Life after the apocalypse is something we don't want to see. It's scary. The probability of surviving on a planet contaminated by war, epidemics or radiation is very low. But humanity always has a chance.  In this collection of photographs, we have emphasized the naked body of a girl, trying to show how fragile human life is. Hopefully there will be life on our planet and no more wars, epidemics, radiation. Life is such a fragile thing and we only live once. Take care of yourself, love this life as much as you can, breathe deeply and enjoy the little things.",
