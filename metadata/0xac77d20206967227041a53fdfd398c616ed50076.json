    "description": "In popular culture the manic pixie dream girl is a character that has the main purpose of inspiring a greater appreciation for life in a male protagonist. To me that is so BS, I always thought a manic pixie dream girl was a cute, quirky, and feminine character that usually had wings, i.e a pixie. When creating these pieces I wanted to depict my own style of that pixie dream girl, but a more female centered character. Each one of these girls are styled off of a color palette or a butterfly, but each has their own energy and style and �don�t need no man�. I want women to feel powerful and beautiful and see themselves in these characters. This is an ongoing series and as the series grows so will the variety of original characters.",
