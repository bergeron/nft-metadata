    "description": "A long time ago in the seventh universe there was a mighty stone that the ancient gods called \"Ethereum\". It is an almighty stone that only the chosen few can possess and use for their own purposes. Many years later the gods decided to give earthlings this stone to test their sense of conscience, honesty and good intentions. \nOn earth, it has become very popular among humans, and is used for both good and evil deeds.  \nBut still the gods...the keepers of the ancient stone believe that people will still be able to defeat their evil intentions and use it only for good and light...so that this stone will flourish as before with pure power and positive energy!",
