    "description": "Double is a series of images which I started to build when my mother discovered that she had to face cancer for the second time in her life. At that time, she thought soothing to spend the weekends at the beach and make long walks through the vegetation. It was a form of getting away of the busy week, filled with medical procedures and exams.  \nI started going together with her in her walks and started to observe that, during some moments, my conscience wasn’t there anymore. It was wandering in someplace else, inside my mind, which I do not know the name. There, the sounds of the birds would mixture themselves with the noise of the hospital machines and the vision that I had of the vegetation would soon give way to numbers and doctor's appointment schedules. Double is an attempt of reconstructing the feelings that evoked that experience; but, this time, to choose the beauty, the hope and the love.",
