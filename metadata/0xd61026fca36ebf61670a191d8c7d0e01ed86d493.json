    "description": "'Equality is Harmonious' is a part of the ‘Patriarchy RIP’, a public art exhibition on billboard ad space in 10 US states curated by Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova and organised by SaveArtSpace. \n\nThe artwork is inspired by a decade of censorship of the feminist movement in China. It depicts a representation of a 2012 protest in Beijing where female protesters dressed as beaten brides to raise awareness against domestic violence.\n\nA protester held a sign that said「平等才和諧」(Only Equality is Harmonious). The phrase captured me as I saw the powerful protest images outside the China firewall. I thought it was beautiful that the phrase reflects the ancient Daoist concept in striving for harmony in society and with nature, while answering why equality is important in an eastern perspective.",
