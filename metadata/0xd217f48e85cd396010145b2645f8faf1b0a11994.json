Wrangler has been tied to cultural movements everywhere and embraced by all walks of life, from rock stars to rodeo cowboys to roller queens, from bikers to factory workers to race car legends to the first coined teenagers. \n\nThrough this collaboration with Deadfellaz and LTD.INC, Wrangler bring vintage Reborn Jeans to the blockchain. These “Undead Denim” come with custom Deadfellaz laser branding and LTD.INC NFC tech that embeds the community directed comic artwork and exclusive digital content onto the jean itself. \n\n“Undead Denim” connects the physical and the digital, celebrates heritage and embraces the tech of the future.",
