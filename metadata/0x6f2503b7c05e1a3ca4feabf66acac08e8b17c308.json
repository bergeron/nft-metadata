That's awesome. But is that all? Aren't you trapped into a forced standard that leads into massive control?\n\nMaybe social media is a social-scoring system we impose onto ourselves that makes possible the complete biopolitical surveillance and control of the population. No aspect of your life remains unobserved. Each click, each purchase, each activity on social media is subject to surveillance. This is what makes us so vulnerable to fake news, leading into separation, social gap and even war.",
