    "description": "Bangkok Chinatown is located on Yaowarat road and famous for mouthwatering street food, well known temples and a handful of museums. \n\nYaowarat road was built in 1891. This 1.5-kilometer road full of history became a cool and hip place for you to chill or even to explore an authentic culture. \n\nDay and night “Yaowarat” is always welcome everyone to see it. After took a Tuk Tuk (opened air taxi) I was having fantastic seafood and some delicious famous Thai-Chinese dessert that everyone must try. I couldn’t help but took this shot that filled with excitements. This is the first piece of my “Neon Bangkok” collection.",
