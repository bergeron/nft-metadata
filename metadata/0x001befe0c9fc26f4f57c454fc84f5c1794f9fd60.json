    "description": "There comes a time the will to move is lost, when the courage to act is gone, when your rhythm is off, and when the talented eye for capturing images is surprisingly lacking.\n\nWhen despair clouds your mind and doubt silently creeps in whispering; \"you do not have what it takes.\" you lack the skill.\" \"you do not belong here.\" \n\nIn this moment to believe otherwise becomes an insurmountable task because your ever creative mind has seemingly lost it's touch and you mind is in turmoil and there you are feeling bereft ... NO!! Broken like a an abandoned Fisherman's row boat, one that used to cruise the sea in style now laying inutile, just like your mind with which you have voyaged the universe of creativity now lays broken, seeking repair that is not forthcoming.",
