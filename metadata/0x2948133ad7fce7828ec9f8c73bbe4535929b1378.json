    "description": "Dreaming Armistice Day by Adigitalscenesart\nAnyone who has lived through the horrors of war \nknows how important the day when the conflicts end is. \nOn that day, that incredible feeling appears in the air\n as if you are dreaming and floating through magical worlds, \nbecause if you have experienced horror and fear, \nknowing that it is now over is something indescribable. \nYou simply have to live the moment and life. \nThis is for all those who didn't get this chance.",
