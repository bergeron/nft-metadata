    "description": "\"When DEEGAN and Mija combine forces it’s hot to the touch. Their song “I’m My Own Enemy” is a one-listen bottle rocket that begs to be played on repeat. It’s punk meets hyperpop. Aggressive, manic, and totally fun, it hits like a carnival ride that yearns to be revisited at least a dozen times, yet somehow never becomes dizzying. \n\nWritten together and produced by DEEGAN, here's how the duo describes “I’M MY OWN ENEMY”:\n\n“I've been making a lot of soul and r&b, but started hitting a wall. I was like, ‘I'm angry. I can't do this. I'm too distracted. I'm too in my own head,’ so I wanted to make something aggressive to get my energy out. Every artist has that feeling of the cloud hanging over them like, ‘You have to do this. You have to do that,” says DEEGAN. \n\n“I mostly only write good songs when I'm either really fucking mad or really fucking sad,” Mija chimes in with encouraging affirmation. \n\n----\n\nThis is the fourth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE. \n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
