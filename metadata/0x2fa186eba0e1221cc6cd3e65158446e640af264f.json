Sometimes it's a mark of a bad experience, other times it's of something that made us grow and be who we are today!\n\nFortunately today, we are being supported when showing those marks, both bad and good, don't be ashamed and show who you truly are and what you truly support!\n\nOnly when you are 100% your true self, you will be able to grow, learn and evolve! Don't be ashamed of your scars of War!",
