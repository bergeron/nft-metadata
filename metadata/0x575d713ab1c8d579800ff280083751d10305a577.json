    "description": "Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to invade Ukraine on the morning of February 24, 2022. In the following months those troops murdered, tortured, and raped thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children indiscriminately.\n\nThis is a charity project to raise funds for the victims of Vladimir Putin and the Russian army. Every dollar sent to the contract via minting will go straight to the official Ukraine ETH wallet. This is written directly into the contract code to provide transparency over the process and assure delivery of funds.\n\nWhile the crimes and criminals of Russia’s war are innumerable, the blame can certainly be attributed to the decisions and actions of one man, Russia’s dictator Vladimir Putin. His name will forever live in shame, and his ugly, feces-covered head will be encoded on the blockchain for generations of humiliation and contempt. \n\nСлава Україні!\n",
