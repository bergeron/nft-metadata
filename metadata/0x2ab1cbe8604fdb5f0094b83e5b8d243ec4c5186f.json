    "description": "Korean artist In Sook Kim explores female identity, societal roles, sexuality, and society's handling of these issues in her photographic series. The series \"Ecce Venus\", probes different life stages of women - birth, childhood, puberty, love, marriage, pregnancy, motherhood, menopause, and death. These stages involve significant physical, psychological, and societal transformations, often bringing uncertainties and fears. However, such life cycles remain constant, only varying in form based on culture, gender, and society. The series aligns each life stage with a disaster scene, hinting at a disrupted unity between humans and nature due to mankind's technological interventions.",
