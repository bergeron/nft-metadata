    "description": "Bitcoin Cartoons is bringing the world of Bitcoin to Political Cartoons. Each cartoon in the collection comes equipped with a puzzle-like message, pun, or point of view for which the viewer must solve. Like Political Cartoonists, the artist peers through the Bitcoin lens, bringing a sense of humor to the political, cultural, and financial climate of today.\n\nThe story of the phoenix and the story of Bitcoin have many similarities. The most prominent being Bitcoin's ability to \"rise again\" after each attempt to instill fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The cartoon depicts El Salvador's volcano as the next catalyst for Bitcoin's rise in adoption.",
