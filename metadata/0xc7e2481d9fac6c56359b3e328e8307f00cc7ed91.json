    "description": "Yosemite National Park is one of the most visited parks in the world, and the classic valley shot is not unique. The shot is beautiful, but I wanted to try and capture something unique. While driving through the park to get to the Eastern Sierra, we were greeted with insanely smoky conditions. In some areas you could barely see ahead of you, and it was horrific. After driving through the smoke, we finally made it into a patch of clarity. The morning sun was illuminating Half Dome and El Capitan, and some residual smoke was creating some incredible layers. I fired off as many shots as I could to capture the amazing scene, and I knew in that moment it was a special shot. I've never seen Yosemite look quite like this since, and it was a special moment for me.\n",
