    "description": "\"Ours boy didn't need more discipline, they needed more love\" - Jason O. Wilson\n\nWe often overlook the negative effects of an absent-present parent. The ones who are there, but also are not. We overlook the unhealed wounds & emotional strain that arises from such an experience. \"I'm just fine\", but are you really? I'm proud that we're opening up the floor to discuss our childhood traumas. What I'm even more proud of is the allowance to feel the emotions that come with them. Sometimes, that's the hardest part of it all. However, thats where the true healing comes.\n\nI welcome you to share your experience within the comment section as this is a judgement free zone.\nYour story just might help someone heal.\n\n\n\nShot & Edited By: Piff Marti\nProduced By: Stoic Beats & pilotkid",
