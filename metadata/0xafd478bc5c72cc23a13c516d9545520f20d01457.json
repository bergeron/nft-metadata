    "description": "This piece explored the dishonesty with the Kimberly Process Certificate. Did the exploration of conflict diamonds make large corporations more profitable? Did they themselves buy from conflict organizations? Do 95% of conflict diamonds still enter the market? What is the point? Who's profiting? \n\nWe don't know many things as they are kept secret. But this art explores the questions I have. I don't hear many people talk about this, I am unsure why. But I hope this art can open a conversation.",
