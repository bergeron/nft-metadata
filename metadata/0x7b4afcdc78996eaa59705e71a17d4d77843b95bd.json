    "description": "This artwork was created using multiple deep learning AI styleGAN, utilizing datasets of over 5 million images crowdsourced from internet manga databases. \n\nThe moving images are not clipped from an anime but are produced by the styleGAN frame by frame, resulting in this sequence. For this series I have layered between 4 to 10 of these outputs resulting in this manga eyeball soup.\n\nI find these loops completely mesmerizing, I hope the viewer becomes as transfixed on the dynamics AI formations as much as I do. I spent a lot of time selecting the best outputs and combinations possible for this series and I hope you get to enjoy them in full resolution. \n\nThe successful bidder will get the entire sequence in 4K and all the frames which are works of art all by themselves. \n",
