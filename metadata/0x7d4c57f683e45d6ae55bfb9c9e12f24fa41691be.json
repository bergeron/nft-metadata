    "description": "\"She was this very unique multi-dimensional creature, a growing collection of everyone she ever met including in her wildest dreams. Definitely attractive, but also scary, and so vividly complex she would create that category of her own pushing the boundaries of reality\".\n\n\n\"In Bloom\" is as per my usual process blending the lines between painting, AI-generation, and relying on a unique blend of tools, techniques, and approaches. This piece's goal is to explore the raw level of complexity and storytelling opportunities offered by Artificial Intelligence in this burgeoning paradigm-changing art world. A place where traditional and technical mastery clashes with raw generative and creative power from these new powerful tools and where still lingers the question of the legitimacy of these new techniques.",
