    "description": "Our dimensions are vibrantly dynamic in nature.  \n\"Philia\" is a Greek word to signify a certain kind of closeness.  \nThe piece is a colorful representation of the fundamental relationship I have with art, the way that the act of painting and I become one in the creative process.  \nI invite you to see the certain points I become in realization of communion and where I have found the places to begin our conversation together.  \nThe painting of mine is digitally created, its size 11812 x 11812 pixels.\n\nGiant Games is a small editions collection that reflects on how we play with what we care about.",
