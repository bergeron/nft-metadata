It explores themes of world building and personal empowerment as Serwah's digital 'reflection of self' embodies the Greek God Aether who was thought to be the god of the 'upper sky'. She lifts up planetary bodies amongst glittering golden structures. The purpose behind the piece would be to show more of a personal connection to a\nmetaverse/universe and how one can be empowered to take on the world as it is always in one's reach.\",\"background_color\":\"ffffff\",\"external_url\":\"https://metaverse.sothebys.com/\",\"image\":\"ipfs://QmUh3ffHULE7Zd1s2PGZp3v7t4YHko7zihi58yKehG1cMe\"}\n"
