    "description": "The secret sauce behind anonymous artist and producer camoufly is his ability to follow his instincts. Written and produced at the start of the year, “airbender” is a sonic reflection of his creative curiosities at the time.\n\nPainting in bright tones, the result is a delightfully whimsical house track balanced in simplicity and depth with crunchy rain-like sounds, airy synth layers, wind chimes, pulsing bass, and a driving kick drum. “When the elements are coming together, you kind of start feeling it.” Indicative of camoufly’s intuitive approach, “airbender” dances in the sweet spot. \n\n----\n\nThis is the thirteenth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
