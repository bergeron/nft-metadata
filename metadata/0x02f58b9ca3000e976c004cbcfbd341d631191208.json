    "description": "Saeko Ehara's artwork is inspired by one of the most iconic paintings of all time - the ‘Mona Lisa’ by Leonardo da Vinci. Beginning with this important portrait painting, Ehara explores combining analogue artworks with digital technology. She has been working with AI x generative art since 2022, testing the interaction of artificial intelligence and traditional portraits created by historical painters. She uses Midjourney (AI), TouchDesigner (node based software for visual coding) and Adobe to bring these influential oil paintings into digital space. Through these artworks, Ehara celebrates the imperfections of humanity by distorting, blending and transforming the faces of her subjects.",
