    "description": "When the hand of humankind sows the Earth and unconsciously creates incredible fleeting visual treasures...\n\nI decided to spend several days photographing the lavender fields in July 2018, as I am against quick stops in places which deserve full mental and physical immersion, so they can be properly appreciated and explored. The lavender flowers reach their color peak during an extremely brief period in Summer, and to create compelling images a good amount of planning needs to be made, taking into account the sunrise and sunset positioning, location of the ancient trees between them, handling the intense heat, finding captivating cloud formations, avoiding people in the framing, dealing with thousands of bees, and so many other challenging factors. \n\nDespite all the challenges, these are always remarkable days of exploration, where time runs slow but is never boring, where the body re-synchronizes itself with the cadence of Nature, going back to primordial ways of being, fully aware of the deep and undeniable connection we have to the Earth.\n\nIn the end, Nature always unveils its beauty for those who tirelessly search for it. \n\n\n- Location: Brihuega Lavender Fields, Spain\n\n- Technique: Single exposure photography\n\n\nCollector will get:  \n \n- 1/1 NFT token, fully certifying provenance and exclusive ownership of this artwork through blockchain technology   \n \n- Fine art high quality 30x20 inch physical print \n \n- High resolution “tiff�� and/or “jpeg” file for personal use  \n \n- Special access to future releases. I fully believe in a symbiotic relationship with all my collectors, hoping to establish an everlasting and meaningful connection for the future",
