    "description": "This is my first song in 2023 and my first feature on Sound. I am excited to focus this year on collaborating and onboarding artists and friends from outside and inside our web3 sphere. \n\nOver the years, Invictus and I have worked on many records. This is one of the first songs Invictus and I made back when we first started making music together and it came together super organically and is one of our favorite songs. We want to share this with you all first. \n\nFrom Invictus: \nI am an alternative genre-bending carbon-based life form. As the head of audio for wavWRLD, I also worked on audio for all of the wavROOM drops. In creating this song, I used the vocals to work with the production like an instrument rather than be the focal point. The song tells a story about the difficulties in relationships, in any form they take.\n\nJoin the wavCOLLECTORS' chat:\nhttps://guild.xyz/karmawav-collectors-wrld\n\nStay wavy ðŸŒŠ \nKarma.wav & Invictus \n\nProduced by: Karma.wav\nVocals by: Invictus",
