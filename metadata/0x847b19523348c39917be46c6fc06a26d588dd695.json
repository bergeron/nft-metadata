    "description": "This drawing, from 1971, was created during my early college years at the University of Northern Iowa. It was a period of my life when I started to realize I could lovingly take my classical training (such as portraiture), mix it with varied media, and create mask-like personality studies. This was a necessary growth; I lived in a powerful dichotomy… balancing the emotions of my privileged life, learning to draw, at the same time that friends of mine were fighting in Vietnam. \n               \nFace# 1- The Withered Man 8”X10”, ball point pen on 100# paper\n\nI clearly remember my joy when I got my first orange ball point pen; I had no idea what I would do with it. The ink was very sticky and I recall the texture in this piece was a response to that stickiness. Still, I was so surprised with what came out! In retrospect, Agent Orange had (by then) been used for ten years, deforesting 4.5 million acres of Vietnam! At that time, orange was not the new black!",
