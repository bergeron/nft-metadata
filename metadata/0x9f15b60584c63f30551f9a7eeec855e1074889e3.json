    "description": "It was May 13th, 2014. \n\nAfter a very brief but pitch black night, I woke up to a cold and misty morning in a small, wooden photo hide somewhere in northern Finland. Sun was yet to be seen but the silhouettes started to appear one by one; all in different shades of blue. First the trees became visible, then the loud calls of seagulls echoed through the forest. \n\nAs I was looking through the tiny opening of the hide, I saw a shadow lurking behind the trees. There it was, a beautiful brown bear, the reason I was in a hide for the past 4 days in the numbing arctic cold.\n\nThere wasn't enough light for a detailed photo so I had to be creative. A silhouette or a long exposure was my best bet. Then it happened, it got interesting. Appalled by the sudden squawk of a seagull, the bear stood up on its hind legs, alert and careful. That was my cue; I quickly turned my camera vertical, framed my scene and pressed the shutter.\n\nIt was 04:48 in the morning and I knew I captured a special photo. \n\n",
