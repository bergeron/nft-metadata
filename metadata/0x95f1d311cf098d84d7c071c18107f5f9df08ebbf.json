    "description": "with care that satisfies all tastes and trends. Spiritual intoxication, likewise abstinence, all forms of self-harm, are equally permissible; … not only are the bars permitted, but they are brightly furnished, and the latter has magnificent tools and torture chambers at its disposal … Not only solitude, but all kinds of social interaction are taken care of. Everyone, invisibly, can witness all the activities of anyone else; … the death dance of worldviews, which is presented daily and in the evenings in this hotel, is accompanied by a jazz orchestra that is pleasant and uplifting for the residents, and this is refreshment after the daily strenuous healing cure.",
