    "description": "Oilpaint , acrylic, embossing on wood Size 40*70\n\nDandelion was calling me As if she had news for me I didn't know if the news was good or bad But I saw that he was injured, he had thrown his self into the glue trap that was tied to the pipe to reach me. It was good to see his I slowly let go and flew, it was news of love, news of hope and how well it was interpreted. It was a true story and then I illustrated it.\n\nIn Greek and Roman mythology, Pluto is the name of the god of the world of the dead, and the motivation for this naming was the great distance of this celestial body from the sun.\nThe character's head was inspired by my studies of Pluto, and since he has legs that don't look human, I definitely wanted him to be non-human, so I named his Pluto God.\nNiloufarhosseini",
