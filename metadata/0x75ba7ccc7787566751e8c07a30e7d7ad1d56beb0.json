    "description": "Visual reflections on the fear that accompanies a pandemic. The worldview of a person in isolation is significantly rebuilt. Being in your closed space for a long time, either a cell or a cage, you begin to forget the former world that you remembered, you begin to visualize a new world, with exaggerated fears and assumptions.\n\nThis work participated in the [fifth Wrong Biennale](https://biennale.thewrong.org/2021-2022) in the pavilion [Acropolis Remix | Embraces: Utopian Proximities](http://acropolisremix.eu.org/)",
