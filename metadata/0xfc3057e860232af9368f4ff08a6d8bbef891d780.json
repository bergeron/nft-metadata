    "description": "Just when I think I’ve found every angle I can with a flower, I try a little longer and find something new. I love the hints of purple hiding behind the white coronal filaments or as I like to call them, the little passionfruit arms.\nIt feels otherworldly, like we’re flying through space, through the stars. \nI named it after Chaka Khan’s song, Aint Nobody because she sings just that,\n\nAnd now we’re flyin’ through the stars\nI hope this night will last forever.\n\n",
