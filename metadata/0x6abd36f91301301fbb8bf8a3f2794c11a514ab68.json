    "description": "This open-ended NFT collection is the inevitable response to my NFT collection \"SEC No-Action Letter Request 3: Securitized NFTs.\" First, I explained to the SEC why the art market has always been a securities market by proposing to sell an editioned work of conceptual art titled \"SEC No-Action Letter Request.\" Then I sold an NFT of the work & an NFT collection securitizing the work. Now I am diluting my offering with an open edition. If this isn't securities fraud, I don't know what is.",
