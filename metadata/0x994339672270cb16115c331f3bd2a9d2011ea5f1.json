    "description": "See the world through my eyes\nTraversing through space and time\nLight lingering through each movement\nReverberations intesify\nAs they continuously move from one to the next\nColors crashing creating calm chaos\nEverything as one\nEverything as truth\nAs above so below\nThrough it all\nA never-ending fall.\n\n---\n\nMy homage to the infinite possibilities of inspiration that have been created by the Avril15 project. \n\nFull screen, sound on, mind open. \n\nOriginal video, animation, and sound, with accompanying prose.\n\n---\n\nThe artwork listed above is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artist Jennifer Donohue (Hues of Jen); the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.",
