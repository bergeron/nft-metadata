    "description": "The shepherd, who was grazing his sheep in the wide fields on the outskirts of Erciyes, was getting angry with the sheep who did not want to return home towards evening.\n\nHe raised his wand and shouted, asking them to walk towards the house.\n\nThe sun was about to set now. An orange color appeared on the horizon. Fields and mountains covered with yellow grass formed a wonderful backdrop.\n\nThe sun had formed a streak of light on the sheep's back feathers.\n\nI was there.\n\n---\nOriginal Size: 3008x2000\nCamera: Nikon",
