    "description": "For an eternity he searched for the key to no avail, until one day he stumbled across a chain. A long chain, winding over the hills, past the horizon. His finger ran familiarly over its links. A smiths locks are built for the chains they seal, and these chains were of the gods. As the chains led him through lands perilous and pristine, another traveller persisted as well. A rhythm through the chain. A heart beat that spoke to his own.  After the sun and moon grew tired of their race, In a land far beyond what was thought possible, the smith arrived. Tangled amongst the chain, submerged in liquid thought, he found his love. Though her mind blinded her to his face, their hearts became enraptured in a fiery conversation. Did her heart remember his or not, we do not know, but by the time they were done, the key had been found. and so had a plan.",
