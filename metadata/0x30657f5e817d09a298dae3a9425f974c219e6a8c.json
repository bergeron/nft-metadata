    "name": "They Are Burning My Home - Pepe ",
    "description": "Pepe has now become a most important character in web3. Pepe art is not just for making memes; pepe can also make a significant contribution to society. As a result, I've determined that my pepe art would be more concerned with conservation aspect. Global warming is the most serious problem the planet has ever faced. The greedy human being who is destroying forest cover all over the world is major reason for this climatic condition. Despite the fact that Pepe is living in the Web3, she is very much worried and disturbed about what is going on in the real world. Their home is on fire, and those forest fires are not far away, and they will consume the remaining of the green cover across the globe. The helpless Pepe and her children are standing on the other side of the river and witnessing the destruction of their home. \n\nGenesis Art 1/1\nDigital Dimension: 7294 X 4764 , 300 dpi\nMedium : Acrylic \nCanvas : 60cm x 40cm\n\nNote: The collector will receive original acrylic art.",
