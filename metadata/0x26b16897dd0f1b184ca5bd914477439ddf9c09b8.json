    "description": "Gleam from The Superchild collection(CRISPR babies) is an interactive, interdisciplinary project in biomedia and bioart that revolves around reconstructing scientific methodologies in cultural phenomena while striving for critical discourse in the public sphere. Scientific and technological progress, which has brought us the ability for genetic manipulation of organisms, has indeed invited invisible, rather unprecedented crises. Such crises have increasingly become closer to the discourse of the body. The Waq Waq tree is a Predictor tree in ancient myths that grows in hell and is the fruit of human and animal or even a cyborg! It is a messenger of the state of the superchild in the posthuman. Participants designed their superchild face plus its code with FBI software (which is used for criminology). I used the face that the participants sent me for their superchild on the waq tree, and its code can be traced in the work.\nSoftwares : FBI FacesØŒ photoshop,After Effects\n2022",
