    "description": "The Taxman is coming, depicts the prevailing haze and deep state of angst in the mind of artists, who find themselves grappling with questions in the new tax regime. As the world  sees only big bucks in the rise of crypto-currencies, the taxman arrives sooner, than later. Far removed from the sheen and gloss, is an artist's reality. \n\nIn this artwork, spoken word artist Angad Sodhi and visual artist Subha Sreenivasan Iyer, use a combination of strong elements, symbols, colours and words, to capture the state of turmoil that prevails when a historic announcement in the space is being made.  \n\nThis work is a spontaneous response to the unfair tax imposed on artists in today’s union budget.\n\nProceeds from the sale of ‘The Taxman is Coming’ will fund initiatives to increase taxation awareness amongst NFT artists.\n\nVisual art: @IyerSubha\nSpoken word:  @angadbsodhi\n\nSocials: \nhttps://linktr.ee/subhasre\nhttps://linktr.ee/angadbsodhi",
