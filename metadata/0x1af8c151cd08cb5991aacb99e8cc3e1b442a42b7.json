    "name": "King George Washington",
    "description": "After leading his newly formed nation to military victory over the British, citizens begged George Washington to lead America.\n\nThough he initially declined, he quickly became disgusted by the incompetence of politicians. After much deliberation, he chose to use his popularity and military power to take full control.\n\nAbolishing Congress and ruling entirely by decree, King George Washington led the Kingdom of America to become the most prosperous nation in the world. \n\nHe expanded west, securing alliances with natives and building global trade routes during his reign. America grew rapidly in military strength and loved their king.\n\nIn 1797, the Kingdom of America launched a surprise invasion on Britain. Catching them off-guard, King George Washington's army was able to quickly reach Westminster and force a surrender, placing Britain under control of the American crown.\n\nPrior to his death in 1799, he named his close friend Thomas Jefferson as the second King of America.",
