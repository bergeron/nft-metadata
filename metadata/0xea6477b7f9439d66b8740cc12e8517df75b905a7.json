    "description": "In the closing moments of the day, I find my mind come alive at Aegean Coast. This moment is something constantly on my mind as I watch the sunset in sea. One of the most vivid sunsets I’ve experienced overlooking Samothraki. My goal as a photographer is to find a way to encapsulate the energy of a destination in an image. For years, I felt confined to in enez. It’s a beautiful world out there, one that I can’t wait to explore again freely.\n\nIn September of 2020",
