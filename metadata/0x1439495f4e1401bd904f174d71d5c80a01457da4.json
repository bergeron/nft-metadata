    "description": "Despite the ruins that surround us,  \nWe hold on to the hope within,  \nFor we know that the soul is indomitable,  \nIt cannot be broken or worn thin.\n\nWe may have faced trials and tribulations,  \nBut we have come out stronger in the end,  \nFor the soul is a force of resilience,  \nIt knows how to bend, but not to bend.\n\nSo let us not get discouraged,  \nBy the ruins that lay before us,  \nFor we have the strength and courage,  \nTo rise up and rebuild, and to not make a fuss.\n\nWe have the power to create,  \nA future filled with hope and light,  \nA future that is truly great.  \nSo let us embrace the hope within,  \nAnd let it guide us on our way,  \nFor the soul is a beacon of hope,  \nThat will lead us through the night and day.",
