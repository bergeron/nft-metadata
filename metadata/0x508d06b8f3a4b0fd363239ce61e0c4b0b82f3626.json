    "description": "Goblins are playful creatures with a knack for harmless mischief. They are no stranger to diving into hidden caves and dungeons for Loot and are especially fond of gold and shiny treasures. They belong to the Noctii race, dwellers of the Underworld. Though not much is known about them, they seem to coexist with the rest of the inhabitants in the Explorer realm.\n\nLoot Explorers are 8000 unique explorer characters decked out with gear found in the first 8000 genesis bags of loot. Each Explorer corresponds to the number of the Loot bag. Putting a twist on the classic RPG style with chunky lines and juicy colors, each Explorer's design is influenced by the loot they carry mixed in with elements such as distinct classes & cool backdrops, all attached to uniquely generated name.",
