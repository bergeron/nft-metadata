    "description": "Apiary delves deep into the underbelly of Lewes, a small town in southern England renowned for its frenzied Guy Fawkes Night celebrations. For many, the night is an expression of anti-establishment values. But looking at this collection it’s not entirely clear whose side we are on. Are we celebrating a failed act of political terrorism that happened over four-hundred years ago or witnessing contemporary ideas of democracy, identity and cohesion stretched to breaking point?\n\n“We have it in our power to begin the world over again” - Thomas Paine, 1737-1809\n",
