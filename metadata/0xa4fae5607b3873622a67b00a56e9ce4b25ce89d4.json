    "description": "Created by: Lost Optics\nLocation: Vienna, Austria \nCreated in: 2018\n\n\nArtist:\nLost Optics is a graffiti and street artist from Romania whose distinctive style is often described as futuristic/constructivist, playing with geometrical forms and bright colors with sophisticated and aesthetic compositions. While inserting basic geometric shapes in peculiar formations, he creates a dynamic effect that goes beyond the classic letter-based graffiti writing style.\n\nArtwork:\nIn the center of the 6th district in Vienna, he painted the \"Amon\" stairway embracing the idea of urban mobility and the pedestrian movement aiming to make the commuting of people more interactive. Combining white space with colorful lines and black and grey rectangles, he created a visual design that invited people to get in touch with the city's infrastructure.\nDue to heavy abrasion, the painting had to be removed two years after its installment.\n\n\nphotographed by Jolly Schwarz",
