Many names will be forgotten forever but their efforts to sustain our world will forever be remembered. This NFT edition is a small way to permanently commemorate those who put their lives on the line so that our economy and lungs wouldn't collapse. \n\n10% of the proceeds will be donated to The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).",
