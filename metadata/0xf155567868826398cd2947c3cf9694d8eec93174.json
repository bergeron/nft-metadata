    "description": "\"In Sync” is an excellent work of art I am proud of. The inspiration came to me while I was walking in the neighborhood park when I witnessed two different circles of people in two different places engage in the same act at the same time.  \nThis body of work explores the various similarities that exist in the way the human dynamics is wired. The skateboards illustrates the continuity of this dynamics until when put at rest. \n\nThis collection makes one give in to the question of whether life is actually a metaverse and humans are just a species repeating the same cycle over and over again.",
