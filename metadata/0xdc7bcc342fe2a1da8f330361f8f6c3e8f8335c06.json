    "description": "That feeling you get when you've been in the arcade too long and every step makes a loud squishy noise. It's the audible sound of nostalgia coming back to remind you of your childhood and that sweetly-sour smell of candy and body odor. Both timeless and ageless, this pattern represents endless amounts of quarters spent beating Time Crisis with your friend while waiting for the movie to start.",
