    "description": "Can you imagine being completely free? What does it mean for you?\n\nPROCESS: During our trip to Istanbul in 2021, we were having lunch with my wife. The cafe was close to Golden Horn. I noticed boys jumping into the water. I dropped down the fork and knife, quickly grabbed my camera, and started running closer to them. After all the adjustments on the go, I managed to take a couple of shots. This one is my favorite due to the movement, boyâ€™s posture, and panoramic background. It seemed to me that these boys were completely free, it made me feel happy.",
