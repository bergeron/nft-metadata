    "description": "A beautiful face out of which rises a big red monster. Who is the monster who sits on your head? What flavour is the rage bubbling inside your chest? I made this work when my heart was broken and I only had a small shard left. I had hope it would grow back 'tomorrow'. I felt like red waves of anger were pounding and crashing inside my chest. If I had a boat it would be on a sea of anger. Made in March 2022 in Nomad Sculpt ",
