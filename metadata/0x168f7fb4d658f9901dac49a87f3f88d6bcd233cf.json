    "description": "\nwe realized [\"bid bunny\"](https://zora.co/collections/zora/7401) would never visit our wallet, so we minted a bunny -- who turned bad.\n\n\nthis is bad bunny. he's free, oneish of a kind, and loves to hop around in your and everyone else’s wallet. he's on a journey every naughty NFT wants: squatting in your wallet for free while multiplying into as many other wallets as possible!\n\n\nhe has no itinerary and loves you, so if you try to send him to a fren he will just multiply while snuggling tight in your wallet. so try to shoo him way by sending him to another fren and watch him make more bad bunnies<3\n\n\nsince he was minted, he always carries with him  all the special things he has found (aka stolen) in the mountains and grasslands of the ethereum valley. who knows, as he multiplies around the blockchain, he may drop a few of his favorite or least favorite things to some of his hosts..\n\n\n“and you get a bad bunny, and YOU get a bad bunny, and YOU get a BAD bunny!” - OPRAH\n"
