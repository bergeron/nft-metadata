    "description": "This is a personal work of mine in 2019. It is also one of the most important works in my life. He started my CG teaching journey and made me meet more than 140 students who want to learn from me. Let me gradually stand out in this industry. And in the near future, I created my own studio, met more partners, and met more customers.\nThis work was also produced before COVID-19. \n2019 has been a great year for me. I hope to cast my growth and good memories of the past into this NFT work.",
