    "description": "'nobody loves you' explores the themes of isolation and loneliness, as well as a personal struggle with mental illness. This record was written after a string of tragic deaths of peers in the music industry, as well as the loss of a family member. 'nobody loves you' delves into the idea that we often wait until it's too late to really show our love, appreciation and respect for each other. \n\nIt was written by Sara Phillips, and produced with Mike Daley and Mitchell Owens. \n\n10% of all primary sales of this record will be donated to the The Trevor Project - focused on suicide prevention and providing 24/7 crisis support services to LGBTQ young people. Thank you so much for helping this incredibly important cause. ",
