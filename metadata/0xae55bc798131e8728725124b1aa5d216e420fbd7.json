    "name": "Garrosh",
    "description": "Garrosh Hellscream, son of Grom Hellscream, was the Warchief of the Horde and the Iron Horde. Having grown up on Draenor, Garrosh came through the Dark Portal upon its reopening, and was invited into the Horde by Thrall himself. \n\nQuickly ascending through the ranks of the Horde military, Garrosh led troops in the Northrend campaign against the Lich King and was given the position of Warchief with Thrall's subsequent absence during the Cataclysm.\n\nThrall challenged Garrosh to a final duel. Hellscream and his potent weapon, Gorehowl, battled with the elements controlled by Thrall and were defeated. Not willing to risk Garrosh escaping and wreaking more chaos upon the universe, Thrall killed Garrosh Hellscream and left him and his weapon on the field of battle, the place where the former Warchief had valued above all others.\n\n",
