    "description": "Virabhadrasana III or Warrior III is an asymmetrical standing asana (posture). Virabhadra is the name of a valiant warrior, the incarnation of Shiva 's fury.\n\nMyths make our dark side more accessible and through this process we extract strength, courage, determination and the light that reveals that the basis of all emotions is love.\n\nWarriors learn to use their resources to the fullest because they realize that most of life's battles take place in our minds, which are won with calm and strategy.\n\nThe practice of this posture loaded with this understanding helps us to find in ourselves the necessary strength to symbolically destroy our enemies, internal and external.\n\nThe Virabhadrasana III Pose allows you to develop your own strategy to reach your full inner power while staying steady and balanced on and off the mat.\n\nOm Namah Shivaya\n\n\nArtist: Stela Narayana\nEdition: 1/1\nDimensions: 5832 × 3893px\nLocation: Rio de Janeiro / Brazil\nPhoto taken: June 2022",
