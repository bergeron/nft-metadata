    "description": "Art Inspiration: I wanted to show an investor whom I can relate and aspire to. She is confident, she is creative, she is bold, she is intelligent, she is fat and she is beautiful. Challenging the societal stereotypes of how smart, hard-working, and capable fat women truly can be and how professional “should” look. Comfortable in her skin, her femininity, and her decisions - she’s soft and savvy.",
