    "description": "My name is Mark Johns, I’m an artist living in LA and have been making music since 2015.\n\nI wrote this on the piano in my room a couple years ago and immediately ran downstairs to bang on my neighbor Brenton’s door. He was in a session with our friend AO beats and I basically hijacked it, begging them to help me turn the piano into guitar. We recorded the whole thing in less than 20 minutes. I cried a bunch and that was it.\n\nAnytime I wanted to put it out I was talked out of it by somebody telling me that there wasn’t enough in it to latch on to. What even is the hook here, there’s no drums, the guitar sounds like ass etc etc etc. I had no interest in changing it so I just never released it.\n\nIt sucked cause songs like ‘I’m sorry’ are the songs that I feel like a part of me is embedded in. They are the ones that take 20 minutes to write because you don’t need to think when you’re telling the truth.\n\nFeels special for this to be my genesis NFT, and I truly appreciate every single one of you who takes the time to listen.",
