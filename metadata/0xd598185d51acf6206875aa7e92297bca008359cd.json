    "description": "Alprazalam’ references Alprazolam, the generic name for Xanax. The lyrics allude to both my friends, as well as a woman I grew up around who struggled with tranquilizer/opiate abuse. A Cancer, the sensitive crab who would never leave her bedroom (her shell) and was largely absent during my young childhood. Aside from taking inspiration from that astrological archetype, I am without hands during the entire video. Not “of this world” and trying to escape that painful reality. The visual is playful and absurd and punky, but there is a dark and melancholic undertone to both the video and song itself.",
