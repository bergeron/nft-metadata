    "description": "Reality can be a dark place for a lot of people, the  \nworld is filled with hate and abuse, terrible  \npeople and systems, pain and suffering. And  \nwe are forced to navigate through it because  \nwe are alive. We push forward through the  \ndark waters in search of something we are not  \nsure of and at any moment without notice the  \ndarkness might consume us.  \nFor a lot of people to be alive is to just be  \nswimming through this dark place alone and  \nisolated from the rest of the world searching  \nfor peace and themselves.\n\nI hope you find the bubbles of light in the overwhelming darkness of existence.",
