    "description": "In a realm where dreams and reality intertwined, there lived a celestial named Althea, the Herald of the Bulls. For aeons, she slumbered, her essence entwined with the rhythmic whispers of the cosmos. \n\nOne fateful day, she awoke to the resounding call of hope, her spirit cried with the yearning of countless souls seeking victory and fortune. As Althea emerged from her sacred rest, with each step, her commanding presence stirred the hearts of the mighty bulls, who gathered around her in a stampede of unyielding determination. \n\nThey charged through the streets, an unstoppable force of prosperity, leaving a trail of abundance and triumph in their wake, inspiring all who bore witness to the indomitable power of belief and unity. \n\nIn legend, those who possess The Herald of the Bulls are blessed with good fortune.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nChapter 2 to my Genesis RA.
