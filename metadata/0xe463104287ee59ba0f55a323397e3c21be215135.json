    "description": "The collaborative artwork with Botto, titled ‘Flowering of Ideas’, prominently features the theme of nature's resurgence. The gradual reclamation of abandoned buildings by nature served as a conceptual foundation, leading us to incorporate animated overgrown foliage into the architectural interiors. This photograph we took of a fern growing within a decaying room exemplifies the phenomena occurring in the structures that we utilize for our artworks, and it served as a point of inspiration for the piece.",
