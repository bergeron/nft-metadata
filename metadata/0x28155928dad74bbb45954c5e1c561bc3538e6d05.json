    "description": "It's late\nThe sun goes down and gives way to the night.\n\nI like the day, it's hot, it's busy... but at night...\nThe night is magic! It has an air of mystery that fascinates me.\n\nHere the magic seems to go further, because it is when the sun goes out that they light up!\nThe lamps indicate the way and the waters of the high tide that invade the streets reflect all this brightness.\n\nThe silence, the brightness, the reflection, the darkness\nWe're paralyzed under the spell of the night\nSo we can only admire.\n\n\n_\n\nThis photograph was taken in 2021, in the city of PARATY - RJ / BRAZIL\nThe city, considered a National Historic Landmark, was designed in the 17th century so that during high tide periods, sea water would enter and leave the streets as a natural way of cleaning them.\n\n\n_\n\nEdition: 1/1\n3780 x2503 | 27 MB PNG\nAMARA - Brazilian Artist\nCopyright: All Rigts Reserved\nThis art can have physical versions\n",
