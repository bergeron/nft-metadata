    "description": "Over the years, in addition to photographic and figurative works, I have been digitally developing abstractions and collages.\n\nThese works are rarely seen because I believed until now that it was a way to rest the mind and then resolve issues in figurative works.\n\nBut now I realize that in addition to resting, they are part of the time of my life, therefore, they should occupy a space as works of art as important as figurative works, and the NFT brought this possibility.",
