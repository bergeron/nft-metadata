    "description": "Spawned from Oakland CAâ€™s colorful car culture, the Scraper Bike Movement gained worldwide popularity through a viral 2007 YouTube music video by local rap group, Trunk Boiz.\n\nA symbol of youthful resourcefulness and creativity, the DIY customized bikes became a ubiquitous sight in Oakland, with dozens of riders taking up lanes and intersections to the delight of all except a few impatient drivers.\n\nThese photos, made between 2008-2010 have been featured in numerous publications and exhibitions worldwide and were selected winners in the 27th annual juried American Photography competition.  \n\nThe movement has since matured into a non-profit organization with whom 50% of all collection sales will be split. \n\nScraper Bike #1\nOakland, CA. 2008",
