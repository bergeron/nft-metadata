    "description": "hey :) this is my first solo release on here. I wrote this song in mid 2020 and have been waiting for the right time to share it and i think that time is now. I haven't released it anywhere so it will be exclusive here. when i wrote the song i had just broken my wrist and it was peak lockdown and i was just on a tear of writing songs and trying to escape the reality of what life was. i hope it feels as special to you as it does to me <3 \n\nmark",
