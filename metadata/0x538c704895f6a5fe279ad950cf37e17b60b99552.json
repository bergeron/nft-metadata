    "description": "<p>The pastel colours used in the piece add to the sense of peacefulness and harmony, but the bleeding of the colours within the face creates a sense of unease and instability. It's as if the face is trying to hold onto the beauty of nature, but it is being consumed by the imbalance that currently exists.</p><p>The strong, determined lines of the face show a resilience and determination to overcome these challenges and restore balance. It is a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of all things, and the importance of respecting and protecting the natural world.</p>",
