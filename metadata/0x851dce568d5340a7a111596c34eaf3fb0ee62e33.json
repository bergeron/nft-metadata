    "description": "El Party is a hazy, hard-hitting is Xcelencia's latest Reggaeton track where he showcases his ability to smoothly move throughout the beat in an effortless manner. The minimal but catchy synth layers and the heavy drums set the vibe right for the summer. This single is part of Xcelencia's latest series album titled, Infinite, which is a multimedia album exploring diverse sounds, collaborations, and innovative platforms. \n\nThe video was filmed in one day in Orlando, FL, my current hometown which is an important part of the Reggaeton movement. For this video we focused on performance shots, dynamic lighting, and a mood the matched the tone of the production on the record.\n\nCrew:\nDirector/DP: @kalvisuals\nProducer: @kelseycolombo \nSteadicam Op: @enmanuelzabala18\nAC: @chris.Sorondo \nBTS Photo & Video: @elimintss \n\nCast:\nLead, Sue: @curlysue.xo\nExtra, Navina:@lady_obstreperous\nExtra, Liz: @Lizwiz100 \nExtra, Hannah: @healthfully_hannah\nExtra: Spencer: @spencer.herman\n",
