    "description": "After the outbreak of the war in February 2022, people who did not agree with the country's policy, who took to the streets, detained and opened cases against them, even for posters with \"*****\", finding this to discredit the army.\n\nIn November 2022, on the air of state channels, the words \"war\" and \"peace\" were censored when singing songs on a music show.\n\nThis interpretation of the cover of a great classic shows just how absurd propaganda can be, even in 2022.",
