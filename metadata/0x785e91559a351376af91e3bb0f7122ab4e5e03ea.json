    "description": "HKO wanted to leave the narrow asteroid he lived on. And soon he fantasizes about running faster than a bird, gliding smoothly like a snake, and enjoying freedom. Suddenly, the Quantum Leap device starts to work, and HKO rides on a mysterious machine called \"Roller Coaster\" on Earth, which has never been seen before.\n\n\nOh no!
