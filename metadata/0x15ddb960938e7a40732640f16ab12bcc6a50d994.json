    "description": "Having confidence in the constant presence of some people leads a person into an illusion of ownership and security, which causes their sudden absence to destroy you.\nThis condition usually occurs after an experience of profound loss. At this moment, you doubt all the other presences in your life. Is there really anyone in this world who belongs to us?\nIn 2018, I lost my only brother forever. The brother I loved dearly. Since then, leaving or separation has a different meaning for me.\nWhen you look at the absence of someone (a lost loved one or an absent lover) through the lens of denial, you feel a shadow of her or his presence by your side. A border between presence and absence. Sometimes you even feel its weight in your arms. It is as if you hold her or his illusory presence in your arms and carry it with you.\nThe physical Copy Of This Work Will Be Sent To The ((Collector Along With The Personal Signature Of The Creator And a Message From The Artist.))\n",
