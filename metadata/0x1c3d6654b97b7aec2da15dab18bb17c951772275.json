    "description": "Temporary is a song that has moved beyond what I originally intended, becoming an experiment of sorts--a song that takes limitless forms and exists in different worlds, allowing the music become a living, breathing entity, forever in flux. Temporary 001 is one of many versions of this song that you will hear. Every iteration of the production (and there are many) will push us further into new territory--working, reworking, and pressing us to be present and settled into the unknown. I hope this experiment allows you to see this song from a new angle. \n\n\n\n\n",
