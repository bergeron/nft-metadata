    "description": "*Generative art*\n*Special edition created for the \"Circus\" World*\n\nThe Ringman is the person who organises and manages the show in a circus.\n\nIn a circus, the world that is presented to us is a mix between illusion and reality. During the show, the Ringman is the link between these two worlds.\n\nThis artwork aims to represent this duality, also presents in our lives.  \n\n**Technique**\n\nPNG format\n3600 x 4500 pixels\nGenerative art \n\nBecause I have introduced a certain amount of randomness into the algorithm, the output is always different. Therefore, this artwork is just one curated edition selected from a large number of outputs that I have generated using the same algorithm. \n\nCoded in JavaScript, using p5.js, love and a lot of coffee.",
