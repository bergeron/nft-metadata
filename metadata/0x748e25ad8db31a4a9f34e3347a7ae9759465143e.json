    "description": "Tell me something\nthat you are scared to admit\nyou know the thing I'm talking about\nThat troubling truth\nthat would make society frown\nThat heartbreaking ache\nthat you may never get over\nThat deep desire,\nthe carnal craving,\nthat feels almost foreign yet you continue to long for it\nShare with me\nShock or surprise me\nbut trust me\nfor I have secrets\ntoo\nOriginal poem by Margaret Lipsey\n\n\nPhoto and poem were part of my 100 day project in 2021 which was an exploration of my sensuality in middle age, the things I have learned, and the dreams that I continue to have.\n\nPhoto is approx 1800x2400px",
