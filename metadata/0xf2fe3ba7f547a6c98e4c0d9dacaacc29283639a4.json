    "description": "The magical world of Oriental miniature, multi-colored, elegant and subtle, was created with the help of kalam - a thin stalk of cane the tip of which was cut diagonally or cracked. Sometimes a cluster of squirrel tail hairs was added to the cane. The result was a brush which was also called kalam. It was with the help of these simple tools that the calligraphers and artists of the Tabriz school created their immortal masterpieces.\n\nI was inspired by these magical miniature paintings and outpainted them with my own style and ideas, merging different stories into one.\n\nMedium: Digital Painting\nStyle: Oriental miniature\nDimensions: 2624 × 3776 px",
