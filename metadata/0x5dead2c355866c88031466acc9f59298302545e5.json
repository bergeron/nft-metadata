    "description": "By revealing to us sights unseen and ideas untouched, progress in technology continues to open up paths for novel thought. Consequently, it allows for an extent of inward exploration that was not previously prevalent.\n\nIt brings metaphysical hypotheses within our reach, extraterrestrial realms within our sight and stars close enough for us to grasp.\n\nAs we move into a paradigm where we evolve from observers and wonderers into experiencers, we - yet again - can become pioneers of a new world. \n\n'STAR GRASP', as a result, contemplates one's personal illumination through the vehicle of outer space technology.\n\n_\n\nScene, Music // by Sage Morei of Horizon Lab\nAvatar // by Ninocence of Lilium Labs\n",
