    "description": "The colourful personality of Jimi Hendrix, the iconic musician, is brought out in this piece through the use of colour gradients, layers and photography applied to the original image captured by Donald Silverstein in 1967. The floral design on Hendrix's shirt was the inspiration behind the addition of my own flower photography bursting out of the borders, which also mirrors the ways Jimi played his guitar with no boundaries.\n\n\nThe photograph used to create this artwork was originally curated and commissioned by LostShoots as part of ‘Frame 69’ - a collaborative NFT project with multiple artists.  \nThe same single frame (film negative #69) from the 1967 shoot between photographer Donald Silverstein & musician Jimi Hendrix has been licensed to each artist taking part, with kind permission of the Silverstein Family Estate.  \nEach artwork within ‘Frame 69’ is a new 1/1 artwork, minted on the artists own smart contract, and curated by Lost Shoots / Matt Humphrey. \n\nOriginal photograph © Donald Silverstein / The Silverstein Family Estate.
