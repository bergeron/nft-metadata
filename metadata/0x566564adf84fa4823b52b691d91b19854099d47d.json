    "description": "This photograph was taken during Chatt puja, an Indian festival where devotees worship Chati Goddess and Sun for supporting life on earth and to seek the blessing of the divine. As the ritual goes women of all ages take a holy dip in river Ganga followed by surya pujan ( sun worship) half merged in water. This mid aged lady was one of them. With pristine devotion she was following the ritual during high tides when the water current were quite strong. She stood there fearlessly like it was a piece of cake but trust me when I say this when I tried to go into the river I couldn’t even walk straight, the water current was pulling me in its direction. I was surprised and shocked at the same time looking at the woman right in front of me looking so timid and yet rigid in her place. I came to realize that muscle power is so trifling when compared to the willpower of one’s mind. \n\nLocation - Kolkata, India\n\nEdition - 1/1\n\nDimension - 3821 x 5732\n\nCamera - Sony A7 3",
