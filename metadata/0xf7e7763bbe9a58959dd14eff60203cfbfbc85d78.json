    "description": "Purpose by Harithra Kurukulasuriya\n\nHere I explore the philosophical reasoning behind my pursuit of art. It is not merely a profession but a way of life - a medium to express my innermost thoughts and contemplate the mysteries of existence. Through my art, I have liberated myself from the shackles of the mundane and embraced the path of the spiritual. This journey has led me to profound self-discovery, and this animation is a testament to my findings.\n\nI share these animations with the hope that they will ignite a spark within you, inspiring you to embark on your own spiritual journey and find purpose amidst a world of fleeting distractions. Let us peel back the layers of illusion together and uncover the beauty that lies within us all.\n\nMusic from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/music/electro-cyber-war-126419/).\n\n1920 x 1280 | 24 fps | 30 seconds | MP4\n",
