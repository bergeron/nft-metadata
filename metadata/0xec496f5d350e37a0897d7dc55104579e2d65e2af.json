    "description": "\"Have no fear of perfection - you'll never reach it.\"\n\nSalvador Dali was a Spanish surrealist artist renowned for his technical skill, precise draftsmanship, and the striking and bizarre images in his work. The Salvador Dalí masks similarly serve as a symbol of resistance and national pride on Money Heist. Like all surrealist art, Dalí’s work was inherently rebellious - the surrealist movement sought to disrupt the norm. Like the robbers (and their red jumpsuits) in Money Heist, Dalí has become a symbol for revolution.",
