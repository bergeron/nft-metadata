    "description": "today the voices are silent\nthere is a curious stillness in my mind\nthe stained hands and my frayed paint brushes\nare waiting to speak a thousand words,\nyet all there is an emptiness,\na numbing stillness that envelopes \neverything in me.\ntoday I will drown in my silence \nand slumber in her arms,\ntoday let me dream in the colours of the forest\nthe earthy brown and the vibrant green,\ntoday let me revel in the sounds of birds and the fragrance of wild flowers,\ntoday let me sleep finding comfort in this strange dream that seems almost real\ntoday let me be free and finally seek my oblivion in the haunting stillness of the wild\ntoday let me just finally breathe\ntoday, just let me be\njust let me.\n\nMedium: Charcoal drawing on A2 size Fabriano sheet rendered in Adobe After Effects.\n\nCollabration with photographer Neeraj K Manoj.\n\nVisual Effects - Vajid Kandathil\nOST - hobartrrj\nContent - Parvathy Madhu",
