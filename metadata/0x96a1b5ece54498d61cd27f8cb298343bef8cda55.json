    "description": "I started dragging friends into old school photo booths at a young age. During Covid isolation I realized how valuable these little strips of photos were as a record of my memories with the people in them. The fact that they were 1/1s made them even more special to me. \n\n\nWhen it was safe to gather again I started setting up my own photo booths at parties. Because I'm not always behind the camera checking focus - sometimes they come out a little blurry. \n\n\nMinting some of my favorites of these photos as NFTs is my way of further securing the memories of these moments with frens. All images in the collection are either my gift to the subject, or held by me as both the creator and the collector. None are for sale by me. If a fren decides to sell one that I've gifted them in the future - that is their call and I fully support it! No royalties will be set.",
