    "description": "\"PILK's HOUSES\" is a collection of unique and visually stunning non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that depict various houses in a whimsical and imaginative style. Each NFT in the collection is one-of-a-kind, and features intricate details and vivid colors that will transport you to a different world.\n\nOne of the most exciting features of this collection is the \"free mint burn 1:1\" feature. This means that for every NFT sold, the same NFT will be minted and \"burned\" (permanently destroyed), making the original even more rare and valuable. This adds an extra layer of exclusivity to the collection, making it a must-have for any NFT collector.\n\nThe collection is a perfect blend of art, technology, and imagination. Whether you're a collector or just someone who appreciates unique and beautiful digital art, \"PILK's HOUSES\" is a collection you won't want to miss.",
