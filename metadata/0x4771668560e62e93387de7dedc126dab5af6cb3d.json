    "description": "\"The Faults\" is the 3rd project in the “Shan-Shui” series.\n\nFor me, mountains are huge creatures on a scale of billions of years.\n\nWith this project I want to present a fast-forward look at the changes in these mountains, not only in the form of growth, but also in the form of fractures and destruction.\nThese movements are driven by different noise algorithms.\n\nAlso this work is an exploration of how to achieve the rougher yet expressive brushstrokes, blooming and “Cun” - the brushstrokes used in traditional Chinese landscape painting to express the texture of mountains and rocks - through the renderer.\n\nRendered in Octane Render.\n",
