Each Citizen in the 2117 Metaverse will be able to access their very own Space Pod to begin their journey to Mars and beyond.\n\nThis is a dynamic collection that will be modified depending on our location on our Journey to Mars. But no matter if itâ€™s a Space Pod on a ship hurtling through space or a plush penthouse apartment on the first colony on Mars, your home will be a versatile and welcoming space you can call your own.",
