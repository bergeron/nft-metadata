    "description": "Agoria\n{Compend-AI-M} #16\n\nOur eyes are constantly tracked but what remains invisible in an art piece? {Compend-AI} is a collection of pieces (movies and stills) which questions the unseen dimensions. \n\nWhere the eye is blind, matter stores memory.\n\nIn the intricacies, between each remnant of {Compendia}, an augmented intelligence cruises among the pigments and exposes what the human eye could not see.\n\nAn invisible culture is revealed.\n\nThe series M of{Compend-AI} is revealing forms and patterns really close to the living. Is there an immanence of the living into the code?\n\nIn collaboration with Johan Lescure.\n\nHD file on demand (145mo)\n\nRes 12288x9216px",
