    "description": "DJ, producer and label head Viiaan release her debut album. ‘Fusagasuga’ arrives via her own imprint and provides a broad survey of the artist’s wide-ranging electronic explorations.\n\nViiaan originally hails from Mexico. It was there that she co-founded Voragine, a label focussed on experimental club music and visual arts. \n\nThis piece is number one in a series of four images that both individually and together respond to the concept behind Fusagasuga. Without fixing a place in space but to the future. With Latin tints and roots of what will be, is, and was technology in the 90s.\n\nFusagasuga cover art by Mexico´s 3D artist Luis Antonio Tovar a.k.a Lats  \nLettering by Mexico´s NY based tattoo artist Alberto Monroy a.k.a Pandemic Tattoo",
