    "description": "About: I almost didnâ€™t capture this image. Fifteen minutes before I released the shutter on this photo, I thought about packing up my gear for the night. The clouds just looked too heavy to produce anything worth photographing. Luckily, I decided to stick with it and the sun eventually found just enough of a window to shine through. \n\nYear: 2022 \n\nCollection: From the Shores of Deception \n\nArtist: Ryan Brookman \n\nEdition: 1/1 \n\nLicense: The holder of this NFT is given full rights to display the image for personal use, including group display or in physical or virtual galleries, as long as credit is given to the photographer.
