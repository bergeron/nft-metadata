    "description": "The Partisan Cats is a collection of 9,999 unique feline soldiers NFTs deployed on the Ethereum resembling men and women defending their country in an unjust war. Our arts and designs will be the reminiscence of these dark and sour days in which the liberation of oppressed people was the ultimate goal for all the heroes defending their country. We call them Partisan Cats! All submissions are made by a single artist and approved by the curation board before they go live. All arts are hand-drawn and designed in detail in a vector software using 518 layers!",
