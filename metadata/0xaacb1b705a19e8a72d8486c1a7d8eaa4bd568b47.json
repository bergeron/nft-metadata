    "description": "Created in 2022-2023.  \n– minted on March 5, 2023.\n\nFlow is a journey inspired by the beauty of nature, with a focus on the interplay between water and vegetation. Flowers fall like waterfalls, and vegetation flows like a spring, even the waves sprout in the form of flowers. Both elements have always been interconnected since time immemorial and are vital for each other’s survival. They “mimic” each other's movements in mesmerizing ways.  \n \nFlow is also a celebration of these natural elements and an exploration of the act of flowing itself. This digital artwork represents the state of being in which we can lose ourselves in the moment, finding a sense of peace and wholeness that is often unattainable in our daily lives.  \n \nThrough this ethereal world, I want to transport the viewers to that realm of harmony and serenity, blurring the boundaries between imagination and reality. By celebrating the beauty and behavior of these elements, my work aims to capture the essence of physical existence and reflect it to the viewer through embodying deeper connections in this digital nature.\n\nReleased in Sotheby's Hong Kong \nContemporary Art Evening Auction  \nSpring 2023",
