    "description": "How young Baiden came to possess the Swan Bow, when it had been in the possession of one of the most feared warriors in all of the Seed Lands - Elayda of Green Temple - has been lost to time. \n\nSome surmise it was a lover's gift. Others that Baiden was a thief. \n\nHowever he obtained it, only one thing is sure - with it, he never missed again. \n\n- From 'Warriors of The Auric Coast' by Gawyle, Scribe of Kreyte.\n\n-------------------\n\nTime is Not Linear â€¢ All Realities Exist"
