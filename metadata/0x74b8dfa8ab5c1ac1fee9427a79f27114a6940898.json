    "description": "A SPAM performance in virtual reality. A meme of meaning, an energy source preserved in a packable stackable can to fight a war or two or three. The countries where SPAM performed became fused with their cultural cuisine. \n\nUpload the video to a platform that supports 360 video or to your VR Goggles and enjoy the performance and listen to that slurp as it slides out of the can.\n\nA hand with a gold ring reaches down and holds a can of SPAM. A can with its distinctive gold can with blue label with the word SPAM in bold yellow.  With a second hand the artist pulls the ring tap slowly upwards. The hand grabs the can. An old CRT TV rests in the background. The can moves upward and upside down. The hand shakes the can again and again. Now the performance goes into slow motion. The edge of the can is seen at the top of the screen.The slab of SPAM slowly slides out, growing larger with its fall to the plate. It bounces slightly on the beige plate.",
