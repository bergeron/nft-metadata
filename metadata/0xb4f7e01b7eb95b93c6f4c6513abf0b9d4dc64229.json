    "description": "Centuries and centuries of information, knowledge and diversity. Nevertheless, we could never come up with the answer we need. Are we living in a virtual world or a reality world? \n\nOur three dimensional perception of our brain sees everything in a solid form, yet solid matter represents less than 1% of the electromagnetic and acoustic spectrum. The only path that can ease our approach to these subtle answers, is knowledge.\n\nMorgan Freeman, a truth seeker, explored cultures, civilizations, looking for answers. He discovered that despite where each individual comes from and what distant memories and beliefs we share, we all try to find an answer to our existence, yet the answer stays unknown.\n\nWith the help of advanced technology we can combine humankind and machinery to find an answer. We will come to know if we are part of a matrix and if we live in a simulation or an eternal life.",
