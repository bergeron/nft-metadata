    "description": "After centuries of industrialization, the planet is ravaged. This Factory series follows the AI Spaceships narrative, taking place on a post-apocalyptic world suffering the effects of climate change. The artworks portray a time after the last humans have been evacuated from Earth to search for a new home. It imagines a desolate landscape being reclaimed by nature after mankind has abandoned it. \n\nAbandoned factories grow giant flowers as tall as two-story buildings which thicken the air with their sweet, heavy fragrance. As the poisoned earth begins to heal, new life bursts through the cracks in the asphalt and concrete, feeding on the returning sunlight.\n",
