    "description": "This is 'Garden #2', the second piece in the 'Garden' series. The concept of a garden has been present throughout human history and holds diverse symbolism. In this work, the garden represents two meanings: 'calmness' and 'pleasure'. In our modern, urbanized world, natural spaces are becoming increasingly valuable, and the garden serves as an artificial yet natural space that allows us to forget the stresses of daily life and find peace of mind. In this rapidly changing era, the artist seeks to provide a sanctuary for our weary minds through the beautiful garden depicted in 'Garden #2'.",
