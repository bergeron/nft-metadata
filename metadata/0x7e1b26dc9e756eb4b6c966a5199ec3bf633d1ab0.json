    "description": "The Little Things is just what its title suggest, a piece about enjoying the little things. \n\nAlthough we are hurt and damaged sometimes we can still find love in the small things. The warmth of the sun, the lovely flying butterfly, the moon and stars in the sky... \n\nAlso you can help other people by doing little things for them to make their life better. A friendly word, a compliment or just listen. Those are all free of charge. \n\nJust hold for a moment and look around you, count your blessings, even if it are only a few. \nThey will give you more strength to move forward. \n\nThis piece is made in 2021",
