    "description": "\"Mushin no shin | 無心の心\" is Zen expression referred to as the state of \"no-mindness\". \nThat is, a mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. \nIt is translated by D.T. Suzuki: \"being free from mind-attachment\".\n\n-\n\n\"Mushin no shin\" depicts a calm state of mind that I achieved after diverse life lessons that brought me balance and a serenity.\nThrough the use of grid systems each element was carefully composed in order to interplay with each other creating a sub-framing effect, this serves to guide the viewers eye by creating a visual rythm that leads into the horizon.\nFilm provides a high dynamic range, which I use to reveal all the intricate details that make Japanese architecture a treasure of human history that translate into visual analogy that represents the structure of a balanced and clear state of mind.\n\n-\n\nBy: Ilan Derech\nCollection: ZEN | 禅\nShot on: Leica M7 & ZEISS ZM 1.4/35\nFilm Stock: KODAK Portra 800\nLocation: Kyoto, Japan\nYear: 2022\n",
