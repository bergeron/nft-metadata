    "description": "The furnace, which was established for the production of charcoal and covered with soil, is called \"torak\". Children who come to İzmir Ödemiş district as seasonal workers from Diyarbakır help their families. By turning their faces towards a future they don't want. Many of the people working in the charcoal business get lung cancer and children being in such an environment poses a great risk for their future.\n\nThe photo won the FIAP Gold Medal for free color photography at the 40th Smethwick International photography Competition in the UK, approved by the World Federation of Photography (FIAP).\n\nPhotographer: Ahmet Çağlar\n\nPhoto size : 4500x3000 px, 300 DPI Edition: 1/1",
