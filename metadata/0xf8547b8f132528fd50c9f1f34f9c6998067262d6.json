    "description": "“I go through cycles. I come back to the Cuban link my father gave me - precious metals being his literal investment - when I’m feeling it, or I pin my hair up in a cute way when I’m feeling it, or both. I think there will always be times where I am at ease with having my gender perceived and other times where I feel hyper aware of the scrutiny it brings. I don’t think I’ll arrive at any end point in my gender experience.”\n\nSequence Index: 5/5\n\nFormat: Animated GIF\nDimensions: 874×1000\n\n© 2021 Fox Smoulder",
