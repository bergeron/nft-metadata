    "description": "✤  ✤  ✤\n\nCome, see the true \nflowers\nof this pained world.\n\n✤  ✤  ✤\n\nWith clouds and mist\nin a brief moment a hundred scenes\nbrought to fulfilment\n\n✤  ✤  ✤\n\nI stared through the glass\nMy reflection in the mist\nBrushstrokes wandering\n\n✤  ✤  ✤\n\nThe flowers\nAre burning\n\n✤  ✤  ✤\n\nIt’s about the past influencing the present & future. The In and the Yô. The Yin and the Yang. It’s about balance and duality not only between two beings but also within a single person.\nEverything is connected in this piece and every detail echoes another giving subtle distortion to it.\nThe real world and its reflection. Where is the line between two realms? Which one is actually real?\nWe tried to answer these questions by making this piece as wholesome as possible, dismantling our boundaries within the artwork making it mutual throughout each stage and every part.\n\n✤  ✤  ✤\n\nArtwork by Mannay x Anton Marrast (2022) — #WEPLRL",
