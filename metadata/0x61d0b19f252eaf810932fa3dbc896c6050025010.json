    "description": "There is little more calming and simultaneously exhilarating than a night spent in the mountains under the stars. Our galaxyâ€™s fingers spreading above us provide scale for our place in this universe. These transcendental moments represent the distant past from which we came and the potential future for which we are destined. This image of the Milky Way over Longs Peak reflecting in Bear Lake is a reminder of our human place on this vast and magnificent planet we call home.",
