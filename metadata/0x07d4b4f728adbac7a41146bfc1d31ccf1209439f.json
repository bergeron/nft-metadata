    "description": "“Mirror” is a story about a woman with a serious alcoholic problem that continuously finds her escape through a glass of whiskey, then  two, then three… and lost.\n\nShe was my roommate. One of the most talented songwriters I know and after years of seeing her struggle through this, I decided to write this song. \n\nIn its genre, this song represents what I’ve been trying to create for a long time. Blending film scores & pop music, I would classify my music as cinematic pop, and hope you resonate with it. \n\n",
