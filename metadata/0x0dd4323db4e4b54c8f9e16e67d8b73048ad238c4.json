    "description": "In this series I deconstruct one of my oldest art series–one that I found myself criticizing to the point that I grew a distaste for it – into something new. Utilizing the photographs from my\u0003“Abandoned” series (2007) and expanding upon it's original concept I'm able to uncover an intersection of the fleeting nature of beauty and the transience of all things while shining light on the resilient beauty that’s hidden in this cycle of entropy.",
