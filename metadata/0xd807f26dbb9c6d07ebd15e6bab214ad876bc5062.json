    "description": "Nestled between the Khumbu and Gokyo valleys in Nepal’s Everest region, Cholatse (6440m) is a stunning peak with no easy route to the summit. The challenging South West ridge is a true hidden gem of the Himalaya and a solid mountaineering objective for most experienced climbers. \n\nIt towers above the treacherous Chola pass used by Sherpas and trekkers alike to travel between the two valleys. Just south of this pass is a lake and in Tibetan ‘Cho-la-tse’ literally means ‘lake-pass-peak’.\n\nThis spectacular giant dominated the western skies as we trekked back from Gorak Shep to Dughla. \nI remember one morning as we ascended through the fog on the smaller neighbouring slopes of the valley we were greeted with the most incredible views as the low cloud rolled through the pass beneath the peak.",
