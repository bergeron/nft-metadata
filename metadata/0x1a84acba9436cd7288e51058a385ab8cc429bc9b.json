    "description": "Levitating in the waters of the Chilean coast, as a ritual, the artist places these sculptures in the form of portals, that represent our origin in the heavens, and that operate as entrances to some unknown places outside this world, but which are connected with our same space and time through this anti-gravity geometry.\n\nPortals and teleportation have been a part of the history of man from ancient texts such as the Bible and the Mahabharata, in which beings of light and even humans appear and disappear from this world, and it is precisely in the water where some of these phenomena occur.\n\nA spiritual, astrological, ancestral, emotional and universal search.",
