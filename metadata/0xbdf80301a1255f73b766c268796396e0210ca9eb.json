    "description": "First piece of Women of Light-Painting collection made by Andrea Riezzo for his visual arts project called Sublument. \n\nMade in one single exposure (2.5 seconds), no effects added in post production. \n\nThe protagonists, in this Gallery, are women. Different by age and by aesthetic traits. Female figures who gave life to unique and suggestive images.\nPhotographic portraits that are a perfect balance between light and shapes. Sublument's aim is to portray women far from the stereotyped beauty standards. \n\nWomen with different stories, told by photography and by the lights of light-painting, capable of making them flourish in their beauty and sensuality beyond age or physical body.\n\nDiscover more about Sublument of the official website: [sublument.com](https://sublument.com) and read all the stories.",
