    "description": "Pepe lived in Moon Lake, located in Iris Valley.\nEvery day seemed boring because\nhe already swam and explored every angle of the lake.\n“What is it going to be, the world above?”\n \nWhen the rainbow raindrops were falling,\nhe prayed that he would have wings\nlike a butterfly he had seen\nso that he could fly above the water and\nexplore the whole world.\nThen, the magic of rainbow raindrops\nhad made Pepe’s wish come true.\n \nPepe flew around gleefully.\nBut, the magic had its limited time.\nAfter the rain, he had to return to his original form.\nFrom there on, he has looked forward\nto the rainbow raindrops.\n \npitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter ",
