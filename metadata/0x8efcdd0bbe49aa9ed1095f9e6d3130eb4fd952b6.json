    "description": "devan & i originally had the opportunity to make this song and submit it for the newest fast & furious movie, \"Fast X\". it was created as an expression of pure adrenaline and devotion to the fast & furious legacy. \n\ndevan made the beat and we sent it over to our good friend, super chilly. he had sent back some lyrics & melodies and i quickly got to recording. we submitted the song, but unfortunately, we didn't hear anything back from the ppl working on Fast X. regardless of that, we wanted to put out the song anyway. \n\nwe made our own “fast X” trailer using clips from the actual trailers on youtube, and put our song underneath it. after putting it out, we instantly got great feedback from our audience, confirming the need for this song out in the world. \n\n“midnight driver” is definitely a different vibe than my usual, but i love it so much.  its funky and the bass is hard. it’s great to create songs about other topics (besides love) and experiment with my sound. the process of creating this song was full of pure joy & excitement, and those are the best emotions to have when creating music. \n\nwe hope you enjoy this as much as we did working on it :) \n\n- mia lailani perez, \ndevan ibiza \n& super chilly <3",
