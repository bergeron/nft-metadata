    "description": "Eyre Square in the heart of Galway City, is officially known as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Park. The square has a rich history dating back to medieval times when markets took place on the green in front of the town gates. In 1710, Mayor Edward Eyre officially presented the plot of land to the city. It remains a popular gathering place for visitors and natives alike and the grass areas are often packed on sunny days. There is also a playground here and seasonal markets take place throughout the year. A bust of the US President Kennedy, who was made a Freeman of the city, marks the spot where he made a speech to approximately 100,000 \nGalway people in 1963, on his last trip before his assassination.",
