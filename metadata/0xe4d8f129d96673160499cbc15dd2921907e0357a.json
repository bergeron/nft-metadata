    "description": "I SHOT MY DEMONS IN THE CITY OF ANGELS\n\n—\nKILL CITY is a love letter to life and death in Los Angeles. Street level photographs of mixed methods on 35mm analog film are burned in flames. Reality is centered, with unexpected beauty found in the damaged capture. \n\nShot in the trenches, this collection is direct exposure of over a decade in the 2010s and early 2020s in Los Angeles. It spans uprisings, subcultures, injustice, kink, and spirituality while remaining a celebration of the will to overcome physical and psychological vulnerability. KILL CITY’s hard edge melts perception and technique to offer a unique embodiment of life in LA.\n—\n\nErika Weitz\nKILL CITY\n150 Piece Collection\n4000 x 5000 jpg\n\n\n© Erika Weitz 2023\nNo License / All Rights Reserved\n",
