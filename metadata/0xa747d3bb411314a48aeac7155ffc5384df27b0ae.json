    "description": "\nWHAT IS IT FOR? \n\nThe NFT Culture Is facing gatekeepers, and digital art is not recognized as art all over the world.. often we hear, it is not real art, and has no value, what is it for? what do you do with it, if it is \"only\" digital? History repeats itself, we are often excluded from the world of art just like the American Figurative Expressionist Michael Hafftka was excluded back in the 80s : \n\nThe artist struggled with having his artworks featured in galleries all around NYC even though they were over 80 at that time in the city... non accepted his artworks and they didn't accept to consider them. He was paying the price for being avant-garde and unconventional. He didn't follow the rules that were dictated by the art patrons and the art “intellectuals” and was criticized by the public and artists.\n\nThe artist made a protest on 57th Street in NYC, a silent protest where he exhibited his artwork on the streets after being refused by the galleries who were gatekeeping his ART.\n\nCriticized for being unconventional and misunderstood\n\nWHAT IS IT FOR ? \n\nThis is our manifesto about this rejection that the world shows towards the evolution of art from Digital Poems to AI, Photography and The Music on the blockchain.\n\nThis is happening with our culture today.  \n\nFOR THE CULTURE \n\nFeatured Artists : \n\n🏴 XCOPY  \n- Right-click and Save As guy  \n- Last Selfie\n\n\n📸 Ali Farouk Saloum \n- Bloodbuzz Michigan\n\n\n🌈 NyanCat \n- Glitch Nyan Cat\n\n\n🌸 Claire Silver  \n- Thixotropy - Silver Edition\n\n\n🖌 Michael Hafftka  \n- Lovers  \n- Grip  \n- The promised land  \n- Hafftka Pepe Fake Rare\n\n\n🇩🇪 eBoy - Blockbob  \n- 118 \n- B ( 🕹 BKK BROS )\n\n\n🟥 NOUNs\n\n\n🎬 Dan Sickles  \n- CryptoPunks  8905\n\n\n🇺🇦 Zhannet Podobed \n- Carpe Diem 2\n\n\n💭JakNFT  \n- !UGH",
