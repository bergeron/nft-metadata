    "name": "Under the Pale Moon",
    "description": "Sat alone under the pale blue moon, Rhea felt a great unease. Suddenly, a dark figure appeared, rising from the mountain underneath her. Infatuated with Rhea's beauty, the dark being revealed himself to be Cronus. The two beings spoke for a while, and Cronus asked Rhea to be his bride. Initially uncertain, Rhea eventually accepted Cronus as her husband. Grand promises of powerful children and a kingdom more extensive than the Galaxy itself were enough to sway her. Something was off, though; as Cronus spoke his words, tears streamed down his eyes. Was this an omen of a cursed marriage, or could his body not hide his deceitful ways?\n\nThis was to be a tale of tragic love, but under that pale moon and starry sky, there seemed a glint of hope.
