    "description": "Imagine not one, not two, but hundreds of butterflies flitting through the air around you as their wings click and brush together. Some so close you can feel the puff of air as they pass by. It happens slowly for the most part. One butterfly here and butterfly there. Before you know it there are hundreds and on some occasions thousands landing in the trees to roost overnight. It is Magical!\n\nThese beautiful insects featured in this image are members of the Super Generation which migrate 4,000-to-5,000-kilometre from southern Canada to the mountains north of Mexico City where, they live seven months through the fall and winter. The previous three generations only live two to six weeks during the summer. \n\nPoint Pelee the most southern mainland point of Canada is a hot spot to find these beautiful creatures roosting in the trees as they wait for the sun to rise and a good wind out of the north to help push them south across Lake Erie into Ohio as they continue their journey to Mexico.\n\n",
