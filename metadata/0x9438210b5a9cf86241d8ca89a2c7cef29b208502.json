    "description": "Dear Reader,\nI Write to You:\n\n\"When power comes and much is expected, would you do the good or watch the people shed a thousand tears?\"\n\nWhen the blindfold of ignorance falls off from the eyes of an average man and he begins to canvass for revolution, would you hear the pain in his voice or would you rather have him point a gun to your head?\n\nAnd when the “lazy youths” begin to clamor for the change you once promised, would your first response be to kill or to heed?\n\nOne might ask themselves, which is more intoxicating, wine or power? The greatest minds on earth do not even need to ponder before realizing that it is the latter.\n\n    There are always two sides to a man - good or bad, but a man cannot choose a side until he has tasted power. Like the earthly scent that fills the air after a heavy rainfall, power is refreshing but like the brawl of a volcanic eruption, it can also be unsettling.\n\n    Power is whatever you make it. Pay attention to the people who gave you this power. \nYour Promises, We remember.\n\nProve to Us that Power doesn’t lead to “Betrayal”",
