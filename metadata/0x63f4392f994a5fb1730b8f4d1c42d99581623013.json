    "description": "Soulection+ is the Web3 extension of our company and culture. It’s where we as a community of creatives and supporters will experiment with art & music on the blockchain. \n\n“Soulection+ Radio: Untitled 001” is our GENESIS Web3 radio show, brought to you in partnership with Sound. After over a decade of using our Soulection Radio platform to share & support the music we love, we are excited to finally be able to break bread with artists on a mix - and share the earnings from the project in real time! \n\nThis Soulection+ Radio mix features all of our great artists who have been essential to the Soulection legacy over the past 11 years. Many of the artists on this mix have never released anything on Web3. We truly appreciate their trust and willingness to experiment with us. Part of our goal as an entity is to make it easy for the creatives we support to comfortably explore how art & music can intertwine with blockchain technologies, and carve a lane for themselves to travel forward independently as they see fit. \n\nThis radio show is curated and mixed by Joe Kay, the recording is approximately 62 minutes, and contains unreleased gems from our closest friends and family. \n\nCollectors will get access to our Soulection “Holders” channel on discord. It will be a space for deeper level conversation, music discovery, and will provide an organic opportunity for us to grow and explore together. \n\nAnd to our golden egg holder, we have something truly special planned for you.\n\nTracklist: \n\nMonte Booker - MINE\nIAMNOBODI - gettoknowu\nJ.Robb & Sango - under\nJayla Darden - TOO CLOSE\nEsta - typical\nJarreau Vandal - dub for Joe\nJ.
