    "description": "Nothing lasts forever.\n\nThe home we grew up in, the friends we've made, the job we have, our hometown, our parents, and our childhood will not last forever. We are here on this earth for mere moments and then before we know it, we are gone in the blink of an eye. The only thing that truly lives on forever are the positive impacts we made during our short time here on earth. Like a child, we are all still trying to figure out our purpose for being here and we will continue to try and find that purpose for our entire lives. \n\nIt's vastly important that we treat each other with kindness and leave the earth a better place than we were born into for the sake of our children and all future life to come. Our children should be able to enjoy life peacefully and grow up without fear and It's up to us to make that happen. \n\nNothing lasts forever.. \nexcept kindness and empathy.",
