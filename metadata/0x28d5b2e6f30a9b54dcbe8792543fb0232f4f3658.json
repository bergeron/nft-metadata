    "description": "Carla Chan - Space Beyond is a forever-changing generative artwork that evolves beyond the artist's life. Bridging the longevity of the Internet and the spirit of blockchain technology, the forms and textures of the work are driven constantly in real time by online weather and demographic data.   \n  365+1 editions â€“ one for each day of the year and the leap day, each is linked to a unique set of data from 31 cities of the most populated countries.   \n  The generative nature of the work charts an unpredictable course and creates a space for contemplation on what is beyond. Space Beyond holder access to physical collectables and artwork Installation. View the collection at [nft.carlachan.com](https://nft.carlachan.com).",
