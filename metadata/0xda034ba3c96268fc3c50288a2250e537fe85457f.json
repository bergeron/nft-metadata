    "description": "Pierced is a commissioned artwork for @CrookedWest.\n\nIn Egyptian mythology, the scorpion is the symbolic animal of Selket, the goddess of the dead. It was her charge to protect the jarred intestines of the deceased after embalming. When @CrookedWest and I were discussing the details of this commission and his experience with scorpions, Selket came to mind. \n\nWhile many scorpion stings won’t kill, the initial piercing will be incredibly painful and often cause neurological symptoms, like numbness or tingling. Quite an unpleasant sensation, which I ventured to capture through cracks and squirting ink, and the detachment one feels from the earth in the moment of intense pain. \n\nIf ever you do find yourself facing off against a scorpion, remember Selket, and know she is near. \n\nThen run.\n\n><><><><><\n\n1/1s in this collection are not tied to the Secrets narrative, and do not receive the same drops as Belladonna and Secrets holders. Myth and Magic holders receive 3 editions of their own monthly drop of unique artwork.",
