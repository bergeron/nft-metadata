    "description": "Love is like a canvas that lays the foundation for every emotion. It is possible to see the love at the base of everything if one looks deep enough.\n\nThe actions we take, the decisions we make, the paths we choose to walk and the choices we have to face… When they collide, love embraces them, integrating them into a harmony.\n\nThat’s why we are so drawn into colors and sounds, smells and feels, the people, the creations and everything that makes life worth living.\n\nVermillion Hyacinth, to celebrate and share the love without the need of a reason.",
