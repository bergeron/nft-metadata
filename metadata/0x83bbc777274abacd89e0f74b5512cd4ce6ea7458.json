    "description": "Book Of Soulz is a new gaming, social and Metaverse NFT project offering inter-operable utility across any game on any platform and in any genre, as well as across socials and the Metaverse. Soulz allow holders to define the essence of who they are in Web 3, as gamers or just as part of the community. In a web 3 Metaverse of such varied settings, there is no universal avatar for physical appearance, but what transcends all visual settings is the essence of who we are - the avatar of our Soulz.\n\nThis series of cinematic NFTs are scenes from our upcoming cinematic story trailer. Our talented artist DayPaintStudio uses a comic book style to perfectly capture the essence of Book Of Soulz, beautifully depicting the life within a hidden dimension animated against a still moment in time from our three dimensional world. Added to that, we have a number of amazingly talented Audio Designers & Engineers who do an awesome job immersing or holders into this world through perfectly matched sound. \n\nWhilst these cinematic scenes are largely collector items at time of minting, they represent membership to the Book Of Soulz. Holders may benefit from future utility in upcoming phases search as early access.",
