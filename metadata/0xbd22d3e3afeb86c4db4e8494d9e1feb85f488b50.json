    "description": "I was fascinated how RGB illumination in any formfactor, typically gaming stations, can catch the eye of anyone simply walking by. Some would spend minutes just adoring the light show. I wanted to create a piece representing this same sensation for the digital world but right from their desk. The DNA of Gamers you could say is what pulls gamers deeper into their game. The only thing that might even make them feel alive is the fantasy of being their character. To assist with this immersion, as well as shape an entire generation, is the addition of RGB accessories to the gaming station. Without this, how will we depict the difference of regular office stations to gaming stations? This is the DNA of Gamers.",
