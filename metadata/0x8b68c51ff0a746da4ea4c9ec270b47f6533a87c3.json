    "description": "Aube-obscure is a dual digital dreamscape that stems from afterthoughts addressing metaverse physicality as analogous tension that sometimes arises with the apprehension of sleep.\n\nPart of the Segments Collection artworks that comes from research where the artist is mainly concerned in colliding the intangible with the visible through felt accumulation of moving textures and sounds, thus threading on asperity between perception and affects. It is created with a live performative system combining modular synthesizers and generative reactive visuals.\n\n",
