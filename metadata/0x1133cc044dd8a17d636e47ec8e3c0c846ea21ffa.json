    "description": "I would ask you why the echoing stir of loneliness now rocks my universe but you wouldn't have the answer. After all, this is a stir you know all too well. \nWe're alone together. We count our losses everyday but we hold on to the win that we still get to stand in isolation while reminiscing over the agony of the throes of all that we have lost.\n\nBut even though I have many losses, I still count you as a gain.  \nWhat can I say? My misery loves company and you are a good one to keep. \n\nI know you think about it too - we are the last of us. \nI hope we've already seen how bad it can get because we have already suffered more losses than we can bare.",
