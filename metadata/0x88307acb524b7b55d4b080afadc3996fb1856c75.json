    "description": "What meaning do humans place in materials and empty space? \nWhat is it at all and what role does it play in the theories of physics? \nHow do we feel ourselves in space?\n\nThe artist works with the digital materials gold, ultramarine blue and glass to deal with these questions. \nShe chose these materials and flowing representation because they have to do with her own experience. \nShe uses them to treat the healing process of her cancer. \n\nThe representation should allow an open interpretation. \n\nSize: 4482 × 4482\n\nCreated 29 August 2022",
