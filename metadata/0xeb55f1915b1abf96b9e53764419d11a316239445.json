    "description": "In this series of works Jasak has digitally manipulated photographs of architecture. He duplicates shapes, changes the scale. With the help of technology, he interferes with architecture dominated by technological progress. This repetition causes a disturbance in perception and, in effect, we become an element of visual disinformation. The accumulation of repetitive elements tires the eyes and makes us dizzy, as do the unnaturally large buildings, which we are unable to encompass with a single glance. The work rubs up against the op-art tradition using the phenomenon of afterimages.\nThe artist is interested in how urban planning affects people's lives, especially in the dimension of globalization - after the industrial revolution and the technological advances that followed it, architecture around the world seems to be moving in the same direction. Skyscrapers, the size of which is limited by the strength of materials, are disconnected from the human scale.",
