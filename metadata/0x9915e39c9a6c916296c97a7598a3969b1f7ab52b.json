    "description": "Step back in time to the era of 90's rave with Pixel Ravers... These pixel freaks are a nostalgic nod to the hedonistic days of yore!\n\nWith 200 unique ravers, each with their own personality, you're sure to find one that you could take with you to the rave. Will it be \"The Newbie Raver\", just trying to keep up with the scene? Or maybe the \"Jaded Promoter\", with a side-eye for every other party in town? There's even \"Ket King\", who's probably on another planet by now, and \"The Shuffler\", always keeping the energy up on the dance floor.\n\n ~*~.~*~*  ~*~.~*~*  ~*~.~*~*  ~*~.~*~*  ~*~.~*~*  ~*~.~*~* \nEach raver comes in a limited edition of two...! ~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*~*~.~*~*\n\nSEE U AT THE RAVE!\n┏( -_ -)┛┗(- _- )┓\n",
