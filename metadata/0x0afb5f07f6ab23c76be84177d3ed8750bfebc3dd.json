    "description": "When I entered the Truso Valley, a remote hiking spot in the mountainous region of Kazbegi, Georgia, I knew I was headed where modern civilization stops and time goes back a few decades.\n\nThe area is filled with interesting sights, such as a mineral lake with vibrant red streams coming out of it, abandoned villages, a monastery and a fortress, which make for an exciting 21km hike.\n\nHowever, luck was on my side that day, and I got to experience something that doesn't happen everyday.\n\nOnly about half an hour had gone by since I started hiking,  and the scenery was unreal, with Terek river running through the valley and steep mountains all around it, revealing at each turn.\n\nA bunch of black and white dots started appearing at the end of the trail, and I swiftly realized that I was about to get swept away by thousand of cows and sheep.\n\nAfter what felt like hours waiting for the animals to come through, I got close to them and looked for the right scene to portray that incredible moment",
