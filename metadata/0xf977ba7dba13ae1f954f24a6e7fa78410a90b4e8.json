    "description": "35.3694° N, 120.8677° W\n\nFebruary 13, 2020\n\nI’m back on the California coast. It feels like summer, and I’m shooting on assignment for one of my largest tourism projects ever.\n\nThe news about Covid is getting worse, and being here feels like the calm before the storm. There's an inevitable dread in the air, but the Pacific Ocean has always been my sanctuary.\n\nI knew I wanted to capture an aerial photo of the iconic Morro Rock for this project. I was able to secure a permit from the city, so I woke up before dawn and drove out to the beach for sunrise. \n\nWhat I saw next is, and probably always will be, one of the most beautiful sights I’ve ever seen. The low fog moving swiftly out to sea, enshrouding the rock while light illuminated the mountains and clouds above the rolling waves.  \n\nAs I snapped this shot, I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me. Grateful I could witness this moment of pure, unadulterated natural beauty before the world as I know it would change forever.",
