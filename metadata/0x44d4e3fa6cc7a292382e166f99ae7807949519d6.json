    "description": "At that moment, we were not born, we simply came into being. We were given a purpose: To watch over the universe and ensure that good was always flourishing. \n\nAt first, we watched over the stars and planets, traveling from one to another. We delighted in the beauty of life, and rejoiced in its endless possibilities. \n\nWe disguised ourselves as humans, hiding our true nature under clothes and masks. And then we went down onto Earth to live among them as ordinary people. \n\nWe are the angels of the Impact Universe.",
