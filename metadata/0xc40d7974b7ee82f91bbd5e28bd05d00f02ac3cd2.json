    "description": "\"Salute\"\n\nIn front of The Metropolitan Museum, I just ended on a tour of art; a beautiful sound of the saxophone got my attention and guided me to this guy. He suddenly started playing the anthem of my nation as he saw me. I was surprised and thought it might be a coincidence, but he gave me a humorous salute after the solemn music finished. It was weird and hilarious; \"how do you know where I came from?\" I asked. He pointed to my shirt, and I realized abruptly that the words on my shirt were, \"2017 Taipei Summer Universiade\". What an encounter! This is so New York!\n\nNew York, New York. 2018.\n\nPhotographed by Bill Lin.\n\n3807 x 2538",
