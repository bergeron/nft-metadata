    "description": "The first two characters I created; Rue told the story of how I felt lost in life, and a lot of the anguish I was going through at the time, but Hope, (as the name implies) I created her when I finally started to see some direction about what I wanted to do with my art and how I wanted to grow consciously. \nSo this piece merges both characters now, and I have been able to embrace those experiences and make art more comfortably.
