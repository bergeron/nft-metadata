    "description": "We are all connected. From the energy that flows within our bodies, to the stars glaring in the skies. Even the tidal currents among the ocean floor keeps our world connected. Each turbidity current having its life's purpose. We each have a unique spark that connects like dots across the universe. Each of us making up our part, our void. When you love someone, it can feel like our hands brushing along the water from the ocean, converging against the shores. What are we without each other? We're connected to the past, present, and future. Our families, friends, all of thee above. We\"re connected to the world we interact with everyday. Nothing goes unscathed, untouched without purposely being around the thing we hold near our hearts. Each bringing us closer to each other as one.\n\nDigital art and motion by Zhannet Podobed\nPhotography by Kristina Podobed\nMusic by Multi-Platinum producer Aeneas \"Hardley Davidson\" Middleton\n",
