    "description": "Etched in Stone is a portrait created using the polaroid emulsion lift technique. This involves removing the emulsion layer of a Polaroid photograph from its backing and transferring it to a new surface, such as paper or canvas. \n\nI have further explored this technique by transferring the images onto watercolour paper and rocks with various polaroid images.
