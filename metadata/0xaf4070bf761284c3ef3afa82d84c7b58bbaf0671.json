    "description": "Whatâ€™s on my mind lately?\n\nEpiphanies.\nLately I've been pretty stuck in my head. Everywhere I go I only see the problems and no solutions. Bills piling up, friends and family getting less attention, questioning everything I did so far. Anxiety creeps in...the classic. \n\nIt's late in the night and there it is. Pure clarity. Like lightning striking a lone tree...my mind is on fire. All those problems are minor and solvable. Just because I'am in a shitty situation of my own construct, it doesn't mean I have no worth or I can't construct myself out of it. I have worth...I made it so far...I can make it further...I can get out of it. \n\nI think I had an epiphany.\n\n\nThank you for reading.\nDonnie\n\n8000x10666",
