    "description": "This image has been taken during a wander around the iconic Torre Pendente in Pisa. This moment turns into something supernatural when the clouds came to show up just in a perfect alignment with the famous Leaning Tower. The moody light created at this point a somewhat divine moment giving even more magnificence to the tower with this perspective.\n\nArtist : Romain Gandr√©\nYear of Creation : 2021\nPlace : Pisa, Italy\nEdition : 1/1\nSize : 4900 px on the long end",
