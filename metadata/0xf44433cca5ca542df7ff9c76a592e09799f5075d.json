    "description": "Grundtvigs Kirke bathed in Summer morning light.  \n\nA relatively new Church from Denmark that was completed in 1940, combining the modern geometric forms of Brick Expressionism and classical vertical of Gothic architecture, the Grundtvigs Kirke took the architectâ€™s family 3 generations to complete.\n\nThe Grundtvigs Kirke is often seen in natural daylight, but the chandeliers add another layer of complexity to the scene. What I love about its interior is the harmony between daylight and ambient light.\n\nObserving a three-dimensional space in its entirety gives us a perspective beyond what the eye can see. It breaks us from reality, plays with our perception of shape and form, and creates a sense of another world.",
