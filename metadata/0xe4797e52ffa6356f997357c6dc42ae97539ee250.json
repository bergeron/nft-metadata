    "description": "Boho Art, also known as bohemian art, is an eclectic artistic style that emerged in the late 19th century as a counterculture to traditional art movements. It is characterized by its free-spirited, non-conformist, and individualistic approach to both art creation and life in general. Boho art features a mix of different styles, cultures, and traditions, and incorporates elements from the natural world, spiritual, mystical symbols, and different ethnic motifs.",
