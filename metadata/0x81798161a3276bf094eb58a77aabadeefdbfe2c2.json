    "description": "DISAPPEAR is the follow up to SPACE & TIME and the second drop in a 4 part series. The song explores our fixation with attention in the digital age, and how we constantly compare our own lives to others.\n\n\"Watch how quick that vanity turns into insanity, mirror mirror in my palm please provide my fantasy.\"\n",

And when they ask me how I'm doing, I'll say living the dream.\n",
