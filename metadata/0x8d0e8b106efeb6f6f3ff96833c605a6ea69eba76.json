    "description": "Prometheus was a Titan god who was known for his intelligence and cunning, but also for being a bit of a troublemaker. He stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans, which really annoyed Zeus. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a rock and an eagle came to eat his liver every day (ouch). But eventually, the hero Heracles came and freed Prometheus, so it all worked out in the end. Prometheus was also known for creating humans out of clay and being a champion of humanity. So basically, he was like an ancient Greek Tony Stark.",
