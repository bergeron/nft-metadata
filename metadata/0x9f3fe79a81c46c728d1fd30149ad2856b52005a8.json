    "description": "June 4th, 2021: Vernal Fall, Yosemite National Park\n\nA trip last summer with my better half and her siblings. We hiked ~12 miles that day and saved Vernal Fall for last in the early afternoon.\n\nThe cool mist served two purposes that day: a welcomed respite from the hike and this amazing shot as it danced with the sun's rays.",
