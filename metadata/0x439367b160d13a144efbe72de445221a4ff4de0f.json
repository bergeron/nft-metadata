    "description": "This is an illustration of the climactic scene from 'Something More Than Loot Itself,' a story in the Genesis Scrolls by DefaultTriangle. The retired pirate, Muirin, confronts the cruel Tayv. This is the first in the Genesis Scrolls Painted series and is a painting in watercolour, pencil and gouache on Fabriano paper.\n\nIt was painted by Ticklish in August 2022.\n\nThe Genesis Scrolls Project is a collaborative effort to write and publish stories set in the Loot universe. \n\nLoot is randomized adventurer gear generated and stored on chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret.",
