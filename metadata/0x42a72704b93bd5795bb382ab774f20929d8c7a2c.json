    "description": "Light and dark, good and bad, beauty and terror - each of us carries within a dichotomy of self, a duality of nature that defines us. But why do we fear our shadows, our horns, as if they are not a part of us? Why not embrace them as well, and let our own complexity shine? For only when we learn to love our two sides, can we truly become whole.\n\nVoxel Art\n\n2023",
