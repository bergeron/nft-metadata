    "description": "1/1 digital art \nI created this art inspired by a story I saw on a trip to the sea. In the evening in a summer caf√©, a cheerful thin girl waitress was running among the tables with customers. She talked to everyone, joked, laughed and attracted attention thanks to her inexhaustible zest for life. She looked like my younger sister, who had also worked as a waitress in restaurants in her youth. This picture stuck in my head and was embodied in such a dynamic art. When I look at it, I feel easy and happy, because you can rejoice in absolutely everything!  \n3000*3000px, 300dpi",
