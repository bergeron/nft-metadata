    "description": "This shot was taken in Waikiki during a summer swell. It started raining - so as usual, I put my drone in sports mode and in reverse, I flew back. What I saw was just amazing - A set was rolling in and then glimpses of a rainbow. My drone session definitely ended on a high that day. Always grateful being surrounded by so much natural beauty.\n\nArtist: Jess Loiterton | Jessloiterton  \nEdition: 1/1  \nLocation: Waikiki Beach",
