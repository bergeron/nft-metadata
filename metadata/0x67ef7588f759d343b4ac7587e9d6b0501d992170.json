    "description": "SH(Ai)RKS is a series of AI-generated images of sharks in swimming pools, inspired by a recurring nightmare I had as a kid. Stylistically influenced by vintage Kodachrome slides of the 1950s-1960s, the collection combines a retro, Wes Anderson color palette with the signature, nonsensical phantasmagoria of both dreams and AI artâ€”including blurry faces, walking on water, flying sharks, and more. Despite their nostalgic, colorful, summertime \"feel,\" these images also strive to visually portray the cold-blooded terror of trying to run (or swim) in your dreams.",
