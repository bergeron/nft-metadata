    "description": "Echinacea symbolizes strength and health, the Bumble Bee symbolizes community, brightness, and personal power along with wealth, good luck, and prosperity.  \nWhat more could you ask for.  \nI watched this fuzzy little worker for quite some time as it carefully maneuvered to collect the pollen from the not-so-soft stamens on this echinacea.  \nNature is just amazing, how everything has a place and purpose. No matter what we humans do, nature continues and gets things done.\n\nCanon 6d | Laowa 60mm 2x macro lens | f5.6 | 1/200sec | ISO 400",
