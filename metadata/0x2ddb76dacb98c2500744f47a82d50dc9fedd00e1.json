    "description": "I was introduced to burlesque scene back when I was based in New York city, since then I was fascinated by characters who perform at burlesque shows. Fast forward 10 years when I've met gentle giant A who \"works\" as a clown at burlesque venue. A is a giant, very shy and soft spoken. All his life people were staring at him because of his  height, which made him uncomfortable and insecure. Now he works as a clown, people do staire and point, but he is protected by mask or make up. \nA came over to my studio where we took  pictures for few hours. This one is my favourite one. I took it between the shots, when he didn't expect it. You can sense melancholy.  ",
