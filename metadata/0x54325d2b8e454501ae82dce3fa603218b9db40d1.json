The winning bidder will be paying for a serious hernia surgery that will allow me to get back to a normal life and back in the water surfing again. Thank you!---\n\nThis project is an exploratory work into the blends of analog and digital applications, with over thirty different analog printed books and magazines scavenged for the perfect pieces. \n\nSyn is short for Synthetic. I searched through dark troves of history finding that the original analog form of information was as twisted as can be sometimes. What is energy? What is being transmuted from creator into creation? \n\nWinner will receive:\n 1 - Original Syn Genesis NFT\n 1 - analog darkroom Ektachrome color positive\n 1 - analog b&w darkroom print, 20\"x 24\" silver gelatin\n\nThe prints will be developed by pbtilton.com who is a master protégé of Clyde Butcher, famed environmental darkroom activist ;)\n\n",
