    "description": "This is not the first time he has sent his citizens to die in another country. A man who beats up his own citizens in his own country. A man whose hands are drenched in blood that cannot be washed away. A terrorist who is pushing the world down the path of World War III.\n\nI feel nothing but pity and hatred for him. I hope his regime falls very soon.\n\nThe work will be auctioned off as a single copy. The money from the sale will go to the development of the project and to help people affected by the actions of this monster in Ukraine. \n\nSince there is not enough room in the territorial defense for all comers, not enough weapons, the author of the project is trying to help his homeland with coin. Support the project!",
