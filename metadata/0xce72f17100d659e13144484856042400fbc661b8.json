    "description": "Lake Urmia is the largest lake in Iran - after the Bahr Al Mayet - is the second salt water lake in the world. In the last decade, due to various reasons, including climate change, influential human factors, such as the construction of dams along the rivers and use of groundwater for agriculture, have caused a large part of the lake to dry up. On several trips to the lake, I have searched and photographed parts of the lake that had water and had not yet dried completely.",
