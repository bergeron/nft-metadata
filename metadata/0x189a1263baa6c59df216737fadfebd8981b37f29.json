    "description": "It was a calm afternoon in Iouanacera, renamed Martinique by French settlers. In between lockdowns and social unrest, that stroll through Balata botanic garden felt like a cure and a disease at the same time. Surrounded by a nature so pure, yet so controlled. \n\nAs mosquitoes dined on my blood, I sat down on the nearest bench to scratch a few bites. When I looked back up, it felt as though right on time for a spectacle. The Carbet mountains revealing their timeless beauty behind the curtain. \n\nUnable to resist loading my camera with a roll infused with purple chemistry, I could not help but wonder : \n\"How many apocalypses did they survive? How many more will they witness or shape?\" \n\nQuestions left unanswered, I wish I spoke their language. Then I took the shot.  ",
