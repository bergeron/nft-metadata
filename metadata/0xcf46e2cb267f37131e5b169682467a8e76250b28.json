    "description": "today marks a year since my first drop on sound! \n\ni released \"better\" on december 20, 2021, and look at how far we've come since then. it's funny because this song is still very much relevant. i've feel better than i did when i originally released this! maybe this song was a manifestation. maybe it's been hard work and consistent growth. either way, i just know that i am so grateful for the way this platform and every single one of my collectors contributed into changing my life. thank you all for showing up for me consistently, time and time again this year. i love y'all deep, forreal. can't wait to see how far we take it next year!\n\nprice is set to 25 editions at .1 ETH to commemorate the original release!\n\nwinner of the golden egg will receive an unreleased merch bundle (4 pieces).\n\nremixed by abjo, the goat himself.",
