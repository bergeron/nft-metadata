    "description": "This is a remix of the original song Daises under the Moon by krp. \n\nThis is also a MINTPASS to my next song releasing on or before Feb 1st. \n\nHolders of this NFT will get a Flat 20% discount. \n\nName of the remix artist: @accsynth. \nMixed & mastered by: @accsynth. \nArtwork: @TadziuMusic.\n\nAccSynth is an aspiring producer, who hails from India. He is a self-taught producer and is trained in Hindustani, Carnatic, and the Western style of music for almost 12 years. It has been his long-term vision to transcend any kind of cultural barriers when it comes to music.\n\nThe original \\\"Daisies under the moon\\\" is a song I, krp, wrote in a countryside in Moscow, Russia in the summer of June this year when I was walking with my wife picking daisies for my mother in law in the wild forest. I walked and came back to the wooden countryside home we were staying in, picked up a guitar and started writing that song... my step dad-in-law was chilling there and my wife too, I distinctly remember.\n\nIt's also a song of hope as I narrate, in my native tongue in the bridge-ish portion, imagining myself to be a bird flying in the night sky looking for something, and being reminded somehow, that I belong to the earth not the skies.\n\nUtility:\n1. Access to future projects, holders-only concerts and token-gated content, details on my website. \n2. You can get all the stems of this remix & the original on request.\n3.
