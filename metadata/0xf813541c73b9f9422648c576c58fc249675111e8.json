    "description": "Trapped deep within a black hole, the VOID stumbled upon an ancient artifact. Although it seemed lifeless, a pulsating cube within the artifact emanated powerful cosmic energy. Despite their best efforts, the team could not activate the artifact, but they sensed its incredible potential. • As the VOID studied the artifact, they knew they were running out of time to escape the black hole. However, they were determined to uncover its secrets and harness its power for the greater good. Through tireless experimentation, they discovered a way to send the Quantum Cube back to the VOID on Earth, but they themselves were unable to escape. • As the artifact vanished into the depths of space, the VOID was left with a newfound sense of hope. The power of the artifact was now within their grasp, and they knew they would one day return to unlock its full potential.",
