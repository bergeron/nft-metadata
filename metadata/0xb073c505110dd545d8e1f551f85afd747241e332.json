    "description": "This series, Plague is the result of the COVID-19 epidemic that defined the beginning of 2020. The ongoing series was made over multiple weeks in isolated quarantine. We now live in a world defined by the attention economy. Sensationalism has always played a large part in the media, and narratives have always been touched by the brushstrokes of human ego, but now, more than anytime in human history we are ruled by self interest and self obsession. Our lives are sensationalist, we blur, crop and refocus, building idyllic narratives for profit. Not monetary revenue, but the revenue that comes with the attention from others. We are constantly bombarded by requests for our attention as marketing become the haze that we drive through everyday. The media manipulates narratives and allows the pursuit of profit to hold president over validity. Images, stories, and glances are given monetary value. Clicks, views, likes, and follows become self worth. Sensationalism is no longer a tool utilized by the media, it is the lens through which we filter our lives for others consumption and validation. This series is an exploration of those profit based grabs for attention. The Plague poster prints are designed to be WheatPasted in a propagandist street-art style, an ironic, aggressive, request for the viewer to take a moment to reflect on the rose colored filter they place on their own lives",
