    "description": "There are not many people that come from far villages of Armenia to the capital city Yerevan. I’ve met lots of young people who have never been here, although Armenia is a very small country. And when schools organize a trip to Yerevan, kids usually travel on very old soviet PAZ buses or old GAZelle marshrutkas. There’s an old PAZ in this photo with kids coming from a village to visit Yerevan. The most active kids usually sit at the back of the bus so that they can freely chat and look out of the window.\n\nYerevan, Armenia 2022\n\n\nLicense:  \nThe holder of this NFT is free to display the associated file privately and publicly, including in commercial and non-commercial settings, and in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
