    "description": "G`s Portal I\n\nAncient tribes across the globe, waterfalls portals to travel across dimensions, unlocking the super-natural, guarded by higher spirits who manifest in rock formations, only letting invited souls in and invisible for all others, exploring the structures of self creating new meta. Portals only available until the sacred rock formation is present. As soon as the rock formation gets washes away by water over centuries the portal vanishes into the ether.\n\nAncient tribes across the world believe in secret places to be portals to other dimensions. These portals are said to unlock the supernatural, giving access to powers beyond what is possible in their world. Only visible to those who are spiritually invited, invisible to all others. Native tribes had long been exploring the structures of self, trying to unlock new meta, transformation and expand their knowledge of the universe...\n\n3 x G's Portal I will be needed for burn & redeem for 1 x Water Guardian.",
