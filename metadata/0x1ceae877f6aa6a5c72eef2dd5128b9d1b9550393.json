    "description": "Sphinx talks about how we force ourselves to repress our feelings due to the competitive nature of society. Feelings are seen as a vulnerability we must hide. His face appears impassive but, after close observation, we discover he is actually full of emotions.\n\nIâ€™ve divided the collection into three phases of a process of self-discovery.\n\nSphinx: In Particles represents the breaking free of all those controlled emotions, leaving millions of particles floating in the landscape with a certain harmony... the harmony of liberation.",
