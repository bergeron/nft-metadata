    "description": "Painting have always been my first passion. Even if I create in all medium possible, I always return to the easel. This particular painting is made with acrylics, paint markers and ink. I have made some post-prod enhancements on colours and deepness so it would be more accurate on digital frames and screens. The process behind this work is pretty simple. I start with a coloured splash and I let my emotions flow during the trip. I always keep in mind that I'm creating a portrait. Let it dry, put some more, hide some elements that doesn't fit anymore and so on... The original painting is also available (as of Sept 15th 2022). This one is a 36\" X 40\". Thanks for reading and hit the heart button if you like what you see.",
