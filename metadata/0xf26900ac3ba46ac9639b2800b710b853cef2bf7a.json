    "description": "We tend to navigate most of our lives without questioning why we are doing what we do and what messages we are sending to the world with what we decide to spend our money and time with. \n\nEvery decision sends a message. \n\nEvery piece of content or product we consume carries with it a lot more than what's on the surface. \n\nSo let's try to be mindful of our choices as much as possible. Instead of just waiting for the change to come from the outside, let's question our own decisions and spend our hard-earned money and precious free time with content and things that are in line with what we want for the world. Look beneath the surface. Actively decide. Question. This is what truly matters, this is what really changes the world. \n\nNext time you decide to click on a link, support an idea, watch a video or buy food or a tshirt, ask yourself first: What are the demons I am feeding?\n\n---\n\nAudio: Ambrose Yu\n\n2022\nInfinite loop. 2048x2048 pixels\n19 secs. 228 frames. 12fps\n",
