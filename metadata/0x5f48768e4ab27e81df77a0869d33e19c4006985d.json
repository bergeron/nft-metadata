The use of AI technology also raises questions about the potential future implications of such advancements. Will AI become a tool for addressing climate change and creating more sustainable cities, or will it be co-opted by powerful interests for dystopian ends? The series invites viewers to contemplate the utopian and dystopian possibilities of AI in the context of our changing world.\n\nOwner of this work may display for private or public use.
