    "description": "History scholars still debate when Saint George was born. His death date is 303 A.D. Gerontios and Polychronia, Roman officers from Lydda, had George. George was raised to follow in his Anici noble parents' footsteps. Diocletian enlisted George when he was old enough. In his late 20s, George was a Tribunus imperial guard at Nicomedia.",
