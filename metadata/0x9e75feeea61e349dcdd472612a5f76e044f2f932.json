    "description": "I created an illustration of a workspace corner in a vignette style, with various elements scattered throughout to take a moment and look back at the NFT artworks I have created so far.  \nThe scene features a girl dressed in casual clothing working in the room, with a glimpse of her work displayed on the screen, and steam rising from a cup of coffee, suggesting a brief break during work.  \nThe wall, resembling an open book, displays the artwork on its pages, giving the impression of \"editing an album.\"  \nThe pendulum clock hanging on the wall is depicted as a \"bookmark.\" It is important to not only keep moving forward but also take breaks and reflect on the past.\n\nAnd so, the creation of new artworks begins.",
