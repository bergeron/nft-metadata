    "description": "\"My Education\" was shot in April, 2010 using a Canon 7D. \n\nThis moment captured the essense of my childhood, growing up in Chicago, IL. Adventures in alley ways, always on your toes, always looking behind you, and quick to run when the time comes. \n\nAt the time, I was so in love with this photograph, that I quit my night shift job at a warehouse to pursue a career in photography and fashion design. I was 19 years old then. \n\nAfter 2 years of being a starving artist, I went back to the safety and comfort of a day job in IT sales. \n\nNow, for the first time in over 10 years, I am inspired to create again, thanks to the incredible Web3 community, and the inspiration and passion I am surrounded by every day.  \n\nThe power of this photograph remains the same now, as it did then, motivating me to capture more priceless moments and create as much as I can.
