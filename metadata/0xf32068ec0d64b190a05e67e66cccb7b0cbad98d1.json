    "description": "A chance email from a Chinese “copy village” was the inspiration for my “Nightmare Series.” The village offered, via email, a list of artists it could reproduce, including three Andy Warhol paintings. Warhol’s entire artistic output had been distilled down to three small 64 x 64 pixel thumbnails of Jackie Kennedy, Liz Taylor and an Electric Chair and they became the inspiration for my doomed and dripping celebrity portraits. Why are they crying ? If you scratch the surface of our lives there's a sadness under the skin.",
