    "description": "Welcome to Reine, in the southernmost part of Lofoten. It's one of the most magical places on Earth and it's the place where I will always want to return. It was a frustrating day because we weren't able to climb up and have the bird's eye view over the whole of Reine and South Lofoten due to a long rain spell. It was 15th September 2015 and our 6th and most prolific day in Lofoten - we took our best pictures on this day.\n\nCan't wait to return! Until then, I will look at this picture and remember it all.\n\nNikon D7100, 21 mm, ISO-125, f/20, 1/40 sec",
