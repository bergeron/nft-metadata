    "description": "In June 1971, Daniel Ellsberg had just surrendered himself to the authorities, accused by the Nixon administration of giving more than 7,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times. Mobbed by reporters on the courthouse steps, he is asked about the specter of personal consequences for his unprecedented disclosure. Ellsberg responds, “Wouldn’t you go to prison to help end this war?” The interview, shot in the middle of a chaotic news scrum, is filtered through the entire Top Secret study of the Vietnam War flickering across the scene.",
