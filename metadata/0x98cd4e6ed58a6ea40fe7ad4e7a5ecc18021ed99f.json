    "description": "This collection was created by way of self-therapy — a place where you can send all your bad energy.\n\nTranslated as 'bustle' from Russian, SUYETA is the first piece of three in the collection. It is dedicated to the chaos of a modern office, city life and the non-stop work. The black waves symbolize how that feeling at times gets bigger or smaller. The piece, however, inspires us to be on top of it (just like the golden typography) and not to be covered under its huge wave. \n\nResolution: 5120  x  2880 px",
