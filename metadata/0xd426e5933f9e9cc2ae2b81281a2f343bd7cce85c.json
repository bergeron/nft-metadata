    "description": "What's the story behind this artwork?\n\nThis is an expression of my subconscious, the monsters inside my head that comes out on the paper.\n\nAn overwhelming landscape, you may see something that could disturb or maybe like you, probably both equally.\n\nAt the end that's the point, find a medium balance between them, sometimes all what you hate and all you love can be at the same view mixed up.\n\nOriginal artwork by #joyquintas. Ink on on a 70x50cm size paper.",
