    "description": "A photograph taken on a chilly morning in Idaho. I woke up to a blanket of snow after an unusual snowstorm in June. Huddled together on the limbs of tree, a group of birds appeared less than eager to brave the unexpected cold in order to start their day. Encountering this scene, I was most struck by the sense of togetherness of this flock and watched as they eventually took off in unison the same way they likely did every day.  \n\nIn this life, we all inevitably face unexpected adversity and struggles at some point. The gift of having friends/family by your side in these times of hardship can make a world of difference in how we face them. \n\nWhether by birth or chosen, find your tribe to weather the storm.",
