    "description": "2013, the beginning of my journey that has led to this day. 2013 was the year I truly discovered my path in music. After attending multiple concerts including Martin Garrix and Hardwell and watching them perform on the biggest stages in the world, I became motivated to start learning how to DJ with hopes of one day getting booked for a show. Throughout experimenting, I began to understand the path I wanted to take and the goals I wanted to achieve.",
