    "description": "That was twenty-four years ago. I remember every stroke and airbrush stroke. I was obeying rather carelessly the stains of a previously marbled paper. Then, when a bull appeared on the left and a female figure above it, I realized I had landed in the myth of Zeus and Europa. For a long time I had developed a kind of coin for this, where Europa rides the bull, the bull kidnaps the beautiful Europa. Below right is an archaic observer in green,\n\nThe picture appealed to experts in magic mushroom research, Christian RÃ¤tsch, Jochen Gartz, Paul Stamets, and so the idea was born to create a \"Magic Mushroom Calendar\". It was published by Nachtschatten Verlag with mushroom photos copied into it, which are not mine. Connoisseurs know the calendar from 2000 and from 2013. After all, the Painting is still mine.",
