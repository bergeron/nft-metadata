    "description": "This premium sample pack from Slam Academy &amp; James Patrick includes 225 modular synthesis sounds, one-shots, and squiggles. Each sound is delivered as a 48K, 24 bit AIFF audio file.\r\n\r\nEvery sound in the pack was made entirely with the modular system in Slam Academy's Studio B Synth Lab. Modules from Make Noise, Mutable Instruments, Malekko, Intellijel, and others as well as the Humble Audio Quad Operator FM module were used as a sound source. Random Sequences sprinkle rhythmic variation to these devices to create a unique library of patterns, one-shots, and sound FX.\r\n\r\nSlam Academy sample packs come with full quality WAV files and include a full copyright transfer. The present owner is also able to receive:\r\n• The Slam Academy Membership Pass: Includes access to all of our online and in-person classes. Including our library of pre-recorded classes, events, and workshops available only to members.\r\n• Access to weekly online lab sessions with our instructors.\r\n• Unlimited studio time in our Minneapolis, Minnesota (USA) studio complex.\r\n• Mastering sessions for all projects that use at least one sample from this library at our Minneapolis studio complex (can be done remotely)\r\n• Music Business/Career Advising Session (over Zoom, up to 60 minutes)\r\n• Access to the Slam Academy Discord Group",
