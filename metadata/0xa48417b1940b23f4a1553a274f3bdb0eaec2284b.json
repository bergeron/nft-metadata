    "description": "I started painting “Eye of Rainbow” in July ‘21 and finished by October for an exhibition. It was curated with the motto “WE = ALL OF US” and was fundraising for LGBTI+ individuals in need. \n\nNow it has transformed into its digital form for a spring-themed NFT exhibition organized by the same kind-hearted person.\n\nWhile preparing for this exhibition, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and the war broke out. These tough times made me realize how unique and magic is each random breath we take. \n\nThis is how “Breathing Colors” collection was made.\n\n‘EyeOfRainbow.eth’ which we reinterpreted with Osman Can Karacı,\nas the first piece of the ‘Breathing Colors’ collection,\nemphasizes the value of every breath we take.\n💜\n\nPainting: \n“FISPIS” on Canvas\n90 cm\n2021\n\nDigital Manipulation: Osman Can Karacı \nLoop Animation, 6 sec\n1280x1280 px\n30 fps\n2022",
