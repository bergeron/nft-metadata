    "description": "“Fire” is one of my favorite songs I’ve made this past year. Ella and I made this song in about two hours last December and I love how easily this song came together, within the first with just the chords and the hook I already knew it was a slapper!! Why favorite part of this track is how the blend of vocals and production came together to make such a unique and fun bop!\n\nHaving primarily worked behind the scenes producing for other artists, I've dedicated the past year to launching my new self-titled artist project and releasing my own songs. I want to express my appreciation to all the listeners who have chosen to support me at the start of this journey! Thanks for listening!",
