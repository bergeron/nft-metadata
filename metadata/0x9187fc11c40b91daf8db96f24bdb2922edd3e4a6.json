    "description": "Our life is a journey. Some may think it is a long journey, some consider it a short one, but we all will eventually go back. Japan has been my inspiration, it has been embodied in memories from my childhood. This artwork represents a symbolic end of the journey. An old man wanders around the ancient streets of a Japanese town. The culture of his forefathers surrounds him. He feels at home.",
