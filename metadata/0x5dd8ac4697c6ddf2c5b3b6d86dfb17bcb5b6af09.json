If these 6 things didn’t happen to me I wouldn’t have achieved what I have achieved.\n\nThe 6 things were: my parents getting divorced, me tearing my ACL, catching the flu, getting infections, catching covid-19, and loosing my dad to gun violence.\n\nIn this artwork you can see those 6 things, me rising above all 6 things, and the key lesson learned from those 6 things.",
