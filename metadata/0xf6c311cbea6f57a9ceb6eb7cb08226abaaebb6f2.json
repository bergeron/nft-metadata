    "description": "This piece is one of my all time favorites, it is a part of me and my journey.  \nAnd exactly that’s why I want to open it to as many people as possible as an open edition.  \nI want to let all you guys own a piece of myself.\n\nIt took me 5 years and over 7 visits to that spot until I finally had the perfect conditions.  \nThe problem with this lake is, that there is only water after the melting season or heavy rain.  \nAnd also a really colorful sky is rare because the sun sets behind some pretty high mountains, where often clouds stick around. These clouds are blocking the sunlight and without the direct light, the sky doesn’t have a lot of colors.\n\nMeaning during my first 6 visits I had 3 times no water, 1 time almost no water and two times water but no colors in the sky.  \nOnly my 7th visit was perfect, and I took this picture.  \nEven after that visit I visited this place again several times during my Dolomites workshops. But I never had a sky like that again. \nI hope you like it as much as I do.\n\nBut it is not only an ordinary NFT.  \nIt is my official token with many benefits.  \n1. Access to my complete English tutorials \n2. Ticket to the raffle of a 1/1 after 30 sales  \n3. Ticket to the raffle of a 1/1 after 50 sales  \n4. Ticket to the raffle of 5 limited 2023 calendar (IRL) after 70 sales  \n5. Ticket to the raffle of a 1 day coaching/event somewhere in Switzerland after 100 sales  \n6. 10% ETH back after the purchase of one of my 1/1 \n7. And more…  \n(The more tokens you own the greater the chance in the raffle.)",
