    "description": "In every country there are underground cultures that flow through the marginal landscapes of the city, constructing separate systems in unnoticed corners where desires abound. This project documents the cultural foundations laid in the early development of the city, such as the underlying desires of civilizational development: sexuality, faith, and trade. The work outlines the cultural landscape outside the perception of contemporary society, depicting the traces of noise that remain in the city, exploring the city boundaries of different times in the same dimension of space.\n\n2048x2048 pixel | 00'40'' loop | 2022",
