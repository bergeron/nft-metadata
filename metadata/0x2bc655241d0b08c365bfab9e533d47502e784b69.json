    "description": "I wrote this in the wake of being in a state where I had so much to talk about, but couldn't put it into words.\n\nAs I touched down at NFT NYC '23, I linked up Smartz from The Usual Suspects + The Pigeons of New York NFT out at The Multiverse Studios. It had been a long day with a lot of road blocks, and I just wanted to vent. Within 30 minutes, Smartz cooked up the perfect vibe for me to just let it all out.\n\n\"A Thousand Words\" is simply a testament + reminder to anyone out there struggling to feel like they are enough. Sometimes, we just have to let go + trust the things that aren't in our control will workout for our better good.\n\nFollow Us on Social Media:\n@nessytherilla\n@smartzworld\n\nWritten by Nessy the Rilla\nProduced, Recorded, Mixed + Mastered by \"Smartz\" of The Usual Suspects at The Multiverse Studios - East Orange, NJ\n",
