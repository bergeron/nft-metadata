    "description": "The concept behind this digital collage is inspired by my own photography and a process I call PhotoLution, or the metamorphosis of my photos into new art works.\n\nMy images are intuitive manifestations of the subconscious, always improvised and influenced by my emotions and visual esthetic.\n\nCreating art allows me to convey and express LIFE in its glory and ugliness. It is my therapy to maintain my sanity. \nI am hoping to trigger a reaction by provoking an emotional response in the viewer.\n\n 1 of 1 / single edition  _  2500 x 3000 pixel\n\nThis piece is part of an extensive collection that originated from a photography project and is based on the continuous evolution of images.\n\n",
