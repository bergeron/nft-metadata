    "description": "Named after the setting of Quentin Tarantino's, The Hateful Eight, \"minnie's haberdashery\" is the grail piece of my \"hibernal\" collection. The photo portrays a landscape featuring an old antique store with a Coca-Cola classic sign in a snowstorm in Connecticut. As with each photo in the \"hibernal\" collection, \"minnie's haberdashery\" is an quintessential reminder of the importance of shelter from the frigid winters that many are left unprotected from. ",
