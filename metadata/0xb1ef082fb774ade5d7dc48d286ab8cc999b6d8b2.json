    "description": "This was inspired by the street food burger stall, one of those stalls that are so popular in Malaysia. \n\nThe burger food scene in Malaysia is like a pair of jeans. It never gets old, and there's always time for a burger, especially during the night.\n\nStreet burgers are a staple amongst many Malaysians, and they are the epitome of what street food is all about. \n\nKuala Lumpur is home to many burger stalls scattered across the city, all of which come with their own rendition of what a burger should be like. \n\nAlthough the burger is not the same, the stalls are all very much alike. This is the icon of the street food burger stall.",
