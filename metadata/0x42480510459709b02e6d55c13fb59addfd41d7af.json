    "description": "The distance between your dreams and reality is you. \n\nBefore you achieve any dream, which by definition is not yet “real”, you must first envision it. Then strive for it. \nThat gap is slowly closed, bridged, by faith and hope. Over time, faith and hope, mixed with action, turn your dreams into reality. \n\nSo go on and merge the two. Let life imitate art and art imitate life. For they coexist in a beautiful dance. Go dance. And allow your dreams to become reality.",
