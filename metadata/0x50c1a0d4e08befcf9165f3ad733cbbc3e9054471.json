    "description": "When you’re up against a trouble,\nMeet it squarely, face to face;\nLift your chin and set your shoulders,\nPlant your feet and take a brace.\nWhen it’s vain to try to dodge it,\nDo the best that you can do;\nYou may fail, but you may conquer,\nSee it through!\n\nBlack may be the clouds about you\nAnd your future may seem grim,\nBut don’t let your nerve desert you;\nKeep yourself in fighting trim.\nIf the worst is bound to happen,\nSpite of all that you can do,\nRunning from it will not save you,\nSee it through!\n\nEven hope may seem but futile,\nWhen with troubles you’re beset,\nBut remember you are facing\nJust what other men have met.\nYou may fail, but fall still fighting;\nDon’t give up, whate’er you do;\nEyes front, head high to the finish.\nSee it through",
