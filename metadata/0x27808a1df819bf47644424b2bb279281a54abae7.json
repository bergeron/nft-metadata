    "description": "Species : Demon\nPurpose : Collection of Souls \n\nLilyth was a demon woman from the depths of hell, and she was known for her seductive ways. She had long, flowing hair the color of flames, and her body was curvaceous and alluring. She wore revealing clothes that left little to the imagination, and she exuded a sensual energy that was impossible to resist.\n\nLilyth enjoyed playing with mortals, luring them in with her seductive ways before revealing her true nature. Despite her wicked ways, there was something about Lilyth that was utterly captivating. Perhaps it was her confidence, or her unapologetic nature. Whatever it was, she had a way of drawing people in and making them want more.\n\nSo beware of Lilyth, the seductive demon woman from hell. She may seem alluring and irresistible, but she is not to be trusted.",
