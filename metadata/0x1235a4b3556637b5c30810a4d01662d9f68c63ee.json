    "description": "Colourful, are we not? Beautiful all around,\nI love your colours, do you like mine?\nI’m sure you do, we are all one of a kind,\nYou seemed confused, what’s this feeling?\nIt’s called ‘Love’, and I enjoy its healing,\nDon’t be frightened, I have my eye on you,\nEven if I only have one single view:\nJoy, laughter, and happiness, surely you can agree,\nYou were once blind, but now you see\nWe are the same, colourful like me.\nTogether now,\nFree.\n\nThe artwork ‘Views’ holds reverence to the different ethnicities and cultures each one of us comes from. We are all full and diverse in the hues of our skin and the cultural fabrics we hold in our hearts. In addition, the artwork pays homage to my cultural background of  Peruvian women and children, who continue to remind me that love, happiness, and joy can be found in all of us, you just have to see it with your one true eye.\n",
