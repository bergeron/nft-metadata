    "name": "Path To Infinity",
    "description": "On every path to infinity, there is always a rocky road with ups and downs. It is as much about the journey as the destination.\n\nCelebrate when it's up, look beyond and appreciate every little thing when it's down. Keep walking, because you will never know how far you can go until you stop trying. \n\nThis photo is taken in Nubra Valley, Ladakh, India. Nubra is also known as Dumra in Tibetan, which means “a valley of flowers”. It is a high-altitude cold desert and also one of the off-beaten paths in Asia. ",
