    "description": "Original watercolor artwork with tracing paper.\n\nApathy itâ€™s a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, or passion. The feeling of external and internal boundaries is unstable, so it is collapse depending on self-perception. An indicator of variability is the feature of tracing paper - the creation of a nebula when the plane of the sheet is distant, thereby blurring the graphic boundaries. \n",
