    "description": "“La Vida es una Comedia Divina” (Pero en el Final, la Muerte Tiene la Última Risa). \"Life is a Divine Comedy, but in the end, death has the last laugh\" \n\nThis piece was originally inspired by the idea of children participating in a séance gone wrong. They experience a frightening scene in which not only is there a literal monster seated with them but the adults around them are the monsters as well. \n\nThis piece is in reference to early trauma that I have experienced in which I learned that the adults who were there to protect me, did not. In this piece the girls share this experience, which is the intention of this piece. While trauma can be a very isolating experience, it does not have to be dealt with alone. \n\n",
