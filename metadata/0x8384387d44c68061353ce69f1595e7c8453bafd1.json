    "description": "This open edition marks the end of a special year and sums up 2022 for me. My NFT journey officially began with a photograph of a solo cheetah in May 2022 and the year now ends with two young cheetahs moving forward together. The year, like many of ours, has been filled with highs and lows. Despite this, when looking back I think of the following:\n\nFriends have been made\n\nOpportunities have appeared\n\nNew skills have been learned\n\nCreativity has blossomed\n\nResilience has been built\n\nConfidence has grown\n\nPatience has been developed\n\nThis photograph of two young cheetahs on the move at dusk was captured in August 2020 in the grasslands of the Little Karoo, South Africa. \n\nThank you for being a part of my journey so far. Having said that, it's just begun.\n\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n\nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
