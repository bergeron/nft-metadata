    "description": "As screens light up with endless feeds,\nOur minds grow numb to nature's deeds.\nThe muse of art, now pushed aside,\nAs gadgets steal our creative stride.\n\nTechnology, our constant friend,\nMay drive us to a digital dead end.\nFor as we lose our imaginative spark,\nOur soul's voice fades into the dark.\n\nSo let us pause and look around,\nUnplug, breathe, and hear the sound\nOf inspiration, that whispers low,\nAnd brings our creativity to glow.",
