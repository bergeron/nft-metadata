    "description": "I spent 9 days in a bomb shelter. There is no light or water. There was only heat from the potbelly stove and a reflected light on the ceiling. Kharkov, my hometown, was completely bombed. I'm forced to flee, leaving behind all of my future plans. But we're still standing. Strong and assured. So far, we have the necessary strength. \n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP, WORLD! Is war a possibility in 2022? That's correct, no!\n\nShow your support for peaceful protests. Spread the word about the situation on social media. Contribute financially to organizations and Ukrainians.\n\nWE WILL WIN, but we will need your help to do so. Let us band together and stand up to those who want to tear us apart.\n\nСлава Україні!",
