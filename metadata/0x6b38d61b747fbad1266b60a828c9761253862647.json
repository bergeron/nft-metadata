    "description": "Good Society 003: xander. - Need You\n\nWe're back with a gorgeous banger this week by none other than xander. He is known for his wide range of production capabilities, including his own vocals, which extend through multiple genres. His first drop in the space was via our collabTAPE with heds in August of '22. You will find xander.'s music peeking through every corner of the scene having placements including with Meek Mill, on outlets such as Majestic Casual, Lofi records, and an extensive catalog of surreal moments and soothing grooves.\n\n\"It was a track I made in 2020, I started with a vocal I recorded on my iPhone saying “I need you” I then processed it to make it sound what it is now.\"\n- xander.\n\nJoin the cult: guild.xyz/goodsociety",
