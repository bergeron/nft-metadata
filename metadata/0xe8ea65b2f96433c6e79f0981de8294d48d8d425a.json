    "description": "As the title implies, it's about a never-ending dream that you wish to live in, and if you had the opportunity to do so, you might stay there eternally. Many cultures worldwide believe in the concept of heaven as a place where you can live an eternal cycle of your fondest moment or dream.\nI'm not sure whether I can speak about Heavens or Hells, but if I had the opportunity to live one moment of my life over again, I would choose that. Even if there were a cost involved, I would not regret it.\n\nThe catch is that you'll need particular memories with someone or things that allow you to recall those experiences. It could have been a person or a thing for someone else, but it was a Dog for me!\n\n\"Dogs \" is a subject I could talk about for hours without getting tired. Dogs, in my opinion, are the best companies in the universe. They must be the only species that is so devoted to humans. We self-centered, lazy, and undeserving humans, on the other hand, never recognize their affection for us.\n",
