    "description": "This is one of two shots taken on 120 mm Kodak Porto 400 film with a Kyiv 60 camera. The picture shows an aspiring actress Tanya. She froze in anxious anticipation of the click of the camera, with an incredibly expressive look that pierces the soul of everyone who looks at this portrait.\n\nThis is the first reel of film shot in my life. 120mm film holds 12 frames but due to an outdated and unreliable camera, 10 pictures were lost. Only 2 saved, and this shot is one of these shots.\n\n Dimensions: 4390x5487\n Camera: Kyiv 60\n Film: Kodak Porta 400",
