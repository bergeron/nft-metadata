    "description": "Two of the most iconic memes in history come together again. \n\nDickbutt and Nyan Cat. \n\nBoth wildly popular on their own, they do share a certain history together as well.\n\nThey first joined forces as NFTs in the CryptoDickbutt OG collection with token #158 minted on March 24th, 2021, paying homage to Nyan Cat by combining elements of both collections into a single gif. It's essentially a gray Dickbutt body with cat ears, rosy cheeks, holding a cherry pop-tart... and I'm pretty sure that's not a tail back there lol. It's seen flying through space leaving a rainbow trail in its wake. Pure bliss for meme lovers.\n\nBoth of these legendary internet memes were brought to life in web3 as NFTs within days of one another in early March of 2021. With the recent release of Nyan Balloon, I was inspired to reconnect the icons for a small limited edition combining an S3 CryptoDickbutt and the Nyan Balloon style sky and animation, with a couple of small tweaks to things. iykyk \n\nThere will be no burn or game or ponzi or raffle or double dutch scavenger hunt reveal mechanic.\n\n69 free for CryptoDickbutt holders  \n69 free for Nyan Cat holders  \n420 for public minting for .0069  \n42 to give away  \n600 total\n\nThis will not make you rich.  \nThis will not make me rich.  \nIt's a fun nft, that's it. \n\nI hope everyone enjoys thiers.\n\n\nAnd very special thanks to @whoaslowbro and @PRguitarman  \nfor bringing so much joy into the world with your skills, creativity, and imaginations.\n\n\nCryptoDickbutts\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CryptoDickbutts  \nhttps://discord.gg/uhRmzP7Uuu  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/cryptodickbutts-s3\n\nand here is a link to CryptoDickbutt #158 \nhttps://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/49272215164227341957529616276745060366364320606730995167344709515373166198785\n\nNyan Cat\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PRguitarman  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/nyan-cat-official  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/nyanballoon  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In1IKpcviIc\n\nloosetooth\n\nhttps://twitter.com/L00sEtooth  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/cdb-lost-legends-by-loosetooth  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/cdbartifacts  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/trash-bag-heroes-by-loosetooth\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the most iconic memes in history come together again. \n\nDickbutt and Nyan Cat. \n\nBoth wildly popular on their own, they do share a certain history together as well.\n\nThey first joined forces as NFTs in the CryptoDickbutt OG collection with token #158 minted on March 24th, 2021, paying homage to Nyan Cat by combining elements of both collections into a single gif.
