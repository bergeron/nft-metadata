    "description": "Starting from an early age, we learned to draw a straight line by connecting the dots. We're all familiar with this puzzle game, right? As soon as we connect the dots, a picture is formed - an animal, a flower, a shape, or something else that is familiar and makes sense to us. As we grow up, we realize that by connecting the dots backward, we can see if a different decision was taken in the past, perhaps our life would have followed a different trajectory. Can we trust that the dots will somehow connect in the future? Only time will tell.",
