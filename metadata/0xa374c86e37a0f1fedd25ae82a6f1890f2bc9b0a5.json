    "description": "In the depth of the Persian Gulf, There seems to be a dance, not on the surface you see but buried deep in the definitions of the culture that once called it a taboo. The nakedness of the truth starring back at the watcher to reveal itself as the only thing there is. The calmness of the fire calls upon the gradients to displays their unique colors in a firey fashion to demonstrate the feeling I have meant to give you in a glance. A gesture to get back to the origins while defying the teaching of the old in the modern time, that seeks to prohibit any sense of self-expression.\n\n\nâœ± Photography | Image size - 3605x5303 | Created - 2021",
