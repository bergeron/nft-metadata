    "description": "This uniquely created piece of photography tells a story of hope. A tough and trying situation is captured by the fiery look of the background and the model represents me at the time.  \nI was going through a very trying moment that almost consumed me but I had HOPE that I would get out of it. \nThe dance gesture made by the model is in anticipation of celebration. \nI share this piece with you as it carries  a big part of my story, my experience and an affirmation that regardless of what the situation might be, ALL WILL BE WELL.",
