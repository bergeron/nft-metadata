    "name": "Chthulucene - Night Octopus",
    "description": "Global warming causes sea levels to rise and all continents are submerged underwater. As a highly intelligent species in the ocean, the octopuses have unlocked the optic gland gene that releases self-destructing hormones after giving birth. Now they can pass on the wisdom of their ancestors from generation to generation. The \"Anthropocene\" ends, and the earth enters the \"Chthulucene.\" \n\nWhen humans are on the edge of extinction due to environmental breakdown, how can we design an elegant extinction so that the upcoming species – the octopus – will remember us with tenderness and empathy? We try to connect with octopuses through learning their movements, through interspecies metamorphosis. Shifting from human supremacy worldview to a world where we have to adapt and learn the becoming of other species; shifting from the central governed brain to distributed intelligence.",
