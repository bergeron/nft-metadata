    "description": "Perception: the ability to see, hear, or become aware of something through the senses.\n\nThis piece was created during a time of my life where my perception was skewed. I genuinely believed I was in a happy marriage, getting better mentally, and moving forward in my life. The truth is I had plateaued, I was stagnant, and I wasn't growing. \n\nOne night I randomly did some psychedelics and my perception completely changed. I realized I had always been unhappy in my marriage and my mental health went downward right when I was a newlywed. My perception was me projecting what I thought my life was. The truth hurt. \n\nI am now divorced, I have grown in my business, and I sextoupled my income in 2021. I am mentally, better than I ever have been. I am growing and I am finally HAPPY again. Perception is everything.\n\nUtility: 30 Minute Photoshoot in NYC or LA",
