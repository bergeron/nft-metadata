    "name": "Queen of the Blue Ghosts",
    "description": "\"In the fading light of the summer's eve, the blue ghosts gather to pay tribute to their benevolent Queen, as she unfurls her wings bringing a nightfall so dark that looks like a velvet blanket, over the world.\n\nAn eerie sound echoes, a whisper in a language understood only by them. Thatâ€™s when they come alive, glowing in the darkness, and if fated, you will see them too.\"\n\n- A collaboration with the wonderful SoulplayClayNFT's!\n",
