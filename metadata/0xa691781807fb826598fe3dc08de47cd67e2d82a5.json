    "description": "I traveled a lot in large and small cities of Russia. The condition of the old dilapidated houses always seemed to me depressing. But at the same time, I found them picturesque and created sketches. I expressed my thoughts in these works. \n\nAfter complete immersion in water, architecture continues to exist, despite the fact that these places have long left life.",
