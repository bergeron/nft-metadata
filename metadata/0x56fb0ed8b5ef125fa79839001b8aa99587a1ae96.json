    "name": "Amber Heard - Narcissistic Abuser or The Abused?",
    "description": "We have all seen the trial. \n\nAmber Heard was she a narcissistic abuser? \n\nThe jury sure seemed to think so. \n\nEither way, this art was designed to show the duality of our society, the emotional scars abuse can leave behind, and no matter how beautiful someone is, they can be very ugly beneath their skin. \n\nThis piece was made by me, using StyleGan XL, an AI algorithm to show the ugliness below the halo effect.... \n\nBecause I - CrypoRezolute - a man - am a victim of narcissistic abuse. \n\nDuring the trial, a recorded fight was played where Amber laughed at Johnny with evil maniacal laughter and said outrageous emotionally abusive things to him. This reminded me of so many fights during an 18-year relationship where I was left with deep emotional scars.\n\nIf you are in an emotionally abusive relationship, leave before you have children. Put your mental health first. Heck, leaving maybe even better for your children to see you in the wonderful light that Narcissistic Abuse so often hides.\n",
