    "description": "Alba comes from the Latin \"alba lux\" or \"white light\" which means the arrival of dawn. \n\n6 years ago, dawn came to light up our lives. An intense, dazzling white light, which asked only to be contemplated and loved.\n\nProud and indomitable, gentle and mischievous, you make your own way like light through the darkness.\n\nArtist in your soul, you like to give your opinion on the work of mom and dad. As you say yourself, \"I'll be a fashion design teacher, I'll teach people to become beautiful\".\n\nYour naivety and your dreams are the purest thing in our lives.\n\nWe, adults have lost part of our recklessness, our innocence, that's also the role of our children, to help us reconnect with the frightened child who still lives in each of us.\n\nWe love you Alba.",
