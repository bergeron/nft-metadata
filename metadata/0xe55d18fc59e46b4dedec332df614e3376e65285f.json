    "description": "Total Escape!\n\n\nThis is Mr. Kaufmann’s total escape!\n\n\nLife and how you feel it depends only on you. Where you are now is the result of your decisions made throughout your life. The temptations to which you expose yourself have made your life what it is. You have driven yourself into your illusion. That is self-deception.\n\n\nAnd you think - everything is fine. But sometimes you miss about true values.\n\n\nAll this was achieved by a lot of alcohol, a lot of drugs, a lot of sex, a lot of sweets, etc.! All of this has caused your system of joy to falter.  Serotonin trap. Now you can’t live without it. Because otherwise you won’t feel the taste of life.\n\n\nBut that's a misconception. By giving up this, you will eventually begin to enjoy life from simple things that will make your life bright and mental health strong.  \nYou will no longer have to dream about the true values of life. You will own them! And you’ll do it consciously.\n\n\n“Total Escape” it’s a total escape from your illusions, mr. Kaufmann.  \n",
