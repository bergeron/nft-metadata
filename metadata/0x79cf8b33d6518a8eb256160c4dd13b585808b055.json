    "description": "One early Autumn morning, I ventured deep into the forest near my home in the Columbia River Gorge. Thick fog was rising from the river, enveloping the evergreens & amber trees, while an early bird was out to catch its worm.\n\nThe moment made me think of the line from one of my favorite Wes Anderson films, \"Moonrise Kingdom\" – \"What kind of bird are you?\" (\"No. What kind of bird are YOU?\") It always makes me smile, as did this quiet moment that morning. \n\nSo then... what kind of bird are you, anyway? =)\n\n5464 × 3640\n\nPrint Included (option only available for original collector) – Contact via Twitter",
