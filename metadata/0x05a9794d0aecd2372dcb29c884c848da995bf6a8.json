    "description": "The stories we told each other. The room in which the stories were told to each other. The echo repeating (the echo repeating), the echo of hearing that same anecdote again. (Yes, the one about how you both met.) One day we'll miss hearing that story. We'll tell it to ourselves, or whoever will listen, but it won't be the same. And so, these mirrors are here, not so much reflecting what we've heard, but what we remember or think we heard. "
