    "description": "At the end of my stay up north, I left out my camera outside for an hour, despite my overall concerns about the weather as I didnâ€™t have access to the internet. The rotation of the Earth is something about our world that hardly anyone notices. When combined with the rest of the universe, it gets genuinely incredible. With this piece, I wanted to show people that beauty. ",
