    "description": "\"I can barely conceive of a type of beauty in which there is no melancholy.\"\n\n-Charles Baudelaire\n\nThis is a composite shot taken at lake Magog in Mount Assiniboine provincial park, BC. I did the 30km hike to the lake with a heavy pack in one day, then pushed myself to catch sunrise the next morning so I could sit alone in the dark and disconnect my mind from my body.\n\nCollector will receive a print",
