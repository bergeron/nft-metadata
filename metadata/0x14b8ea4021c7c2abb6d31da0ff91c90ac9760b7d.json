    "description": "Christmas is coming! The twins already prepared everything for this special day!\n\n“What is your Christmas wish, Ram?”\n\n“I want more cakes. How about you?”\n\n“I wish people can forget their problems, heal their wounds, and enjoy their Christmas. You know? Sometimes people are so busy and forget how to have fun.” Lan smiles.\n\n“Well, that’s a nice wish. Everybody deserves to be happy.”\n\n“Yeah! Everybody has been working so hard. It’s time for holiday! By the way, are you ready to give our presents to everyone?” Lan is ready with her magic wand.\n\n“Ooh! Sure! Let’s go!” Ram is so excited to cast the spell with his twin sister.\n\n“Guiding stars, bring a happy Christmas for everyone. Make them warm, heal their wounds, and make them happy.”\n\nThe shiny little stars appeared and reached everybody in the town. The twins hope the stars can reach you too. Merry Christmas!",
