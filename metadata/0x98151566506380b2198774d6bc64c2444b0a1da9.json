    "description": "COVID-19 reveals something striking about mimesis and viruses as contagion sits deep in our modus operandi. Diseases thrive and spread in humans, passing to people in close reach, but figuratively contagion can also relate to the spread of emotions such as solidarity, sympathy, panic and anxiety. Given the spate of global crises bearing down on every part of the globe for the past 4 years, a mutation of body and mind occurs. Our story begins with seven mutant bulbs with surficial budding with increasing breath and potency.  The rate of budding is generative based on the data of spreading COVID infections since 2019.  Each bulb represents a continent on earth poised at the brink of a viral flourishing that would change the way the human world operated in the 21st century.",
