Tabor, where it perches on the shimmering Piedras Platas at night (Piedras Platas is Spanish for silver stones). During the daytime, the bird goes off somewhere but it comes back at night to rest, and it sings beautifully before it sleeps.\"\n\nInspired by the Philippine Trogon (Harpactes ardens) modified for the cyberpunk/neon theme\n\nGuhit Pinas x Philippine Web3 Festival entry\n\n3840 x 2160 px\n\nIllustrator x Clip Studio Paint\n\n",
