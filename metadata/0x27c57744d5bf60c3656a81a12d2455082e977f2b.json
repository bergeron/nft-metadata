    "description": "The following was a channeled message Wanda Honeycutt received when she asked for information from her spiritual guides about the meaning of her painting “Vortex”:\n\nAs we all emerge from the womb, we also emerge from the central core of existence.  We all come from this core of creation.  All of humanity and all of life….. plants, animals, as well, all have this spark of life force energy.\n\nThe swirling energy of this vortex is a prime example of this kind of energy.  It’s self-sustaining and travels in an ever expanding outward direction.  In this painting we have the eye in the center, representing the eye of God, the third eye.  It’s that energy center in the human body that connects to the beyond.\n\nBy beyond, we mean all that is not currently perceived in what you call the physical reality.\n",
