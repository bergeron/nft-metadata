    "description": "《Elysium Chill》 is based on the original Elysium Shell character modeling and costume with extended changes.\n\nThe first step is to turn the original delicate face into a crooked ugly face as much as you can imagine.\n\nThe second step is to scramble all the cool accessories to make them look like the knock-off in the night market.\n\nThe third step is to turn all 3D model into low-poly, low-quality, and low-reduction.\n\nFinally, if it is a version with pets, we turn it into an alien Chihuahua.\n\nMore about 《Elysium Chill》 : \n\nhttps://medium.com/@pupupupuisland.eth/wtf-who-made-this-shitty-version-of-elysium-shell-205547d831bb",
