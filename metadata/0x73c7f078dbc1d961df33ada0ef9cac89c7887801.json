    "description": "It is unknown when the Wenolin was first forged. Variations can be dated to at least 4500 years before our present time. The sword was referenced in Yon’s “Ages Past to the Time of Kingdoms” written around 2400 KA. According to Yon, the weapon was used by Somane in the war between the Kingdom of Granvalden and the Kingdom of Neren (p 1142). Described as perfectly balanced with the ability to cut asunder the femur of a Cranaan. Though hyperbolic, it is the standard sword for many of the suits of Alucar and coveted by some of the other houses who regularly import them.",
