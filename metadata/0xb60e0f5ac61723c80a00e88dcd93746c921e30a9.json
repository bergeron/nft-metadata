    "description": "Our story begins with magical text that emerged into a vivid scene of an abandoned textile factory. The Cyphernaut attendants left in a rush, filled with fear their encryption methods were about to be broken. With fabrics left hanging that skirt the limits of concealment, you have a choice— meet the reserve and begin to crack the code or wonder what you've missed until someone else beats you to it. It's only a matter of time until the workshop is found. Take what you can, some materials are more valuable than others.",
