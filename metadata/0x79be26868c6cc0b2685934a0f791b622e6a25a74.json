    "description": "Les Fleurs du mal is a collection of photographs taken and color corrected in post, giving the image its desired look. The group is named Les Fleurs du mal as it refers to the famous 19th-century book of poems written by Charles Baudelaire. Whos poetry at the time was considered vulgar decadent, and filled with debauchery. Charles Baudelaire is regarded as the greatest poet of the period. Writing about modern themes, though dark. The images I have created are based on the prose and imagery of Baudelaire's collection of poems and prose titled Les Fleurs du mal. This image is from the English gardens of a renowned landscape architect Law Fotterall. Who's gardens have won numerous awards in Philadelphia, Maine, and Florida. The process to make the image is lengthy as nothing is done randomly. With the use of Photoshop and DXO's filter Nik collection, I was able to archive my goals of creating images worthy of Baudelaire's prose. ",
