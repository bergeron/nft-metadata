    "description": "The goal behind the Seekers Society NFTs is to raise funds that the band can use to operate. We’re a small, independent artist - we’d like you to think of this like you’re investing in our startup company - $MZERO - and we’d like to reward you mightily over the coming years for taking the chance on us. We won’t be Google or BAYC, but this initial fundraiser will really help us begin to grow - and we hope that this project will help pave the way for future independent artists to make a living. The band will use this money to fund endeavors essential to the growth of our band and business.",
