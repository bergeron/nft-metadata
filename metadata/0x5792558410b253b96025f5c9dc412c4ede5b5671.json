It's anonymous. It's everywhere. It's real-time.\n\nThe avatar can move around. It lets you meet friends and strangers. You can talk in chat balloons, chat windows, and in a videoconference. The perfect tool for ad-hoc online meetings. No other tools required.\n\nNeed a quick videoconference: just use it. Want to make an online event: tell your guests to install weblin.io and meet on your web site. Need a better tool for meetups: see your participants on the meetup page, do the talk, and socialize. Want to have a community-feeling for your YouTube stream: offer weblin.io to your viewers and see them engage.",
