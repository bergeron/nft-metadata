    "description": "When she was a little girl she was very whiny. She loved rain.\nBecause rain hides the tears of sadness.\nShe cried and cried, and when her tears turned into a lake and she wanted to sink into it, the hydrangea whispered to her, \n\"Raise your face. Look at the sky.\"\nThe sky was bright and clear, with a rainbow bridge.\n\nNow she does not cry.\nShe is strong, gentle, and dignified like a hydrangea flower.\nShe takes the sad tears of someone in the world and turns them into healing rain and returns them.\nTo tell you that one day there will be a rainbow in your heart.",
