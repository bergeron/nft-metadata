    "description": "This photo was taken in Ankara's Kaleiçi district in 1965, by an Asahi Pentax camera and 50 mm Pentax lens. 36 color film was used.\n\nOn a very hot July morning, while I was walking around the Roman Theater in Kaleiçi district, two children hungrily eating watermelon caught my attention. It is one of my best known, most iconic photo. This photograph has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications.\n",
