    "description": "Our Co-Founder Daril Fannin grew up in a cult where film and television was forbidden. At 17, Daril broke the rules and watched “The Matrix,” which changed his life forever. Emmy-nominated Art Director Kory Heinzen took Daril’s story and love for Sci-Fi as inspiration and combined it with his talent to create this piece. Our Founding Member NFT is the spark of a rebellion. Kino is on a mission to democratize film and television and protect the rights of artists. Owning this piece means that you’re joining the revolution.",
