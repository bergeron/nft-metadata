    "description": "Scheherazade - this is a series from The Self Cycle.\n\nPhoto-portrait turns into a completely unique opportunity to contemplate their physicality from the position of the observer. In such a situation, we have a different opportunity to meet and \"meet\" ourselves. In the case of a self-portrait, we simultaneously move away from our body (we look at it from a distance and from the side), and approach it (since we see it in a completely inaccessible for us perspective, we can see its smallest details and outlines). Such dialectics of \"near and far\" brings our understanding of our own body to a completely new contemplative and conceptual level. ",
