    "description": "Hanako is taking her sweet Shiba Inu puppy out for a special stroll today. What makes today's walk so special? Hanako is taking her pup out to view the cherry blossoms as they have recently come into full bloom. She puts on her Spring yukata and ties a gingham scarf around her puppy. Together they enjoy the flowers and the petals, as they dance down from the branches overhead. Even when the little puppy grows tired of running, Hanako holds him so he can rest and smell the blossoms all around. \n\nJPEG\nDimensions 2480x3508",
