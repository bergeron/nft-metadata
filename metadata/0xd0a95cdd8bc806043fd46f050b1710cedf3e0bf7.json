    "description": "Even the ripest looking fruit can drip with the sweetest poison ~ be careful which apple you pluck. \n\nTree limbs bare budded \nWith lush, dark, stark leaves\nShimmer in moonlight\nEmerald like thieves.\nThe allure, the desire.\nThe resist, the approach.\nThe pain and power,\nThe estatic reproach.\nCuriosity simmers. \nDeep desire burns.\nTime stands still\nAnd yet the world turns.\nFragile and fleeting.\nBitter and sweet.\nMinute by minute.\nBirth and death meet.\n\nVisuals & Sound by KX\nPoetry & Performance by Sarah Ferguson\nProduced & Performed by Laurence Fuller\nProduced by BLKPRL Studios",
