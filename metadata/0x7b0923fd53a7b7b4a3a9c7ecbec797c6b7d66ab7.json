    "description": "It was a quiet July morning, harvest day, but this morning the world was change forever...\n\n'When 8 years ago I started working and creating my world of 1920+ I wanted to share my passion for history, my love for the countryside and wild nature, fear of war, maybe build interest and awareness about difficult period in the history of my country and Europe. So that people do not forget and not repeat the same mistakes over and over again ... In my darkest dreams, I didn't expect that in 2022, my vision would become so real and will painfully begin to resemble reality.'\n\nThis painting is part of my 1920+ alternative world and IP (which you may know from products such as Scythe or Iron Harvest).\n\nDigital painting (2019)",
