    "description": "At the Twilight, Where The Full Red Moon Showcase Itself And With Companion Of Moon Owls 🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉🦉 Gathering Around The Spiritual Surface.\n\nAt the twilight, a moon appeared in the sky: Then it landed on earth to look at me.\n\nLike a hawk stealing a bird at the time of prey That moon stole me and rushed back into the sky.\n\nI looked at myself, I did not see me anymore; For in that moon, my body turned as fine as sout\n\nThe nine spheres disappeared in that moon; The ship of my existence drowned in that sea.\n\nInside this new love, die.\n\nYour way begins on the other side.\n\nBecome the sky.\n\nTake an axe to the prison wall.\n\nEscape.\n\nWalk out like someone suddenly born into color.\n\nDo it now.\n\nYou're covered with thick cloud. Slide out the side. Die,\n\nand be quiet. Quietness is the surest sign that you've died.\n\nYour old life was a frantic running from silence.\n\nThe speechless full moon\n\ncomes out now☯️☣️✡️\n",
