    "description": "This was a treasured moment, aimlessly wandering through the deserted parts of North West Australia. It was my first experience of what it feels like to be in a desert, there was a impeding sense of isolation, but with that, came unimaginable beauty. Itâ€™s like we had a whole world to ourselves, an endless stretch of shifting sands. In this final hour, the light and everything it touched turned into gold. ",
