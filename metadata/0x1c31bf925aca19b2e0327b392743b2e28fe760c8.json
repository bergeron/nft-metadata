    "description": "A team of Buffaloes charging at a fleeting speed, the raging crowd, splashing muddy water : a concise description of \"Kambala\" Festival.  \nThe energy exudes from the whole arena makes the festival even more stimulating. And for a photographer, the scene of this festival is full of shot screaming the energy of humankind. The most troubling task at the hand of a photographer while taking such a photograph is the uncertainty of getting a successful shot. Often times the capture images are not complete, blur or even a miss of shot. It took me a great amount of patience, concentration and adequate amount of skills used to produce a shot worthy of satisfaction and appreciation.  \nKambala festival is an annually conducted buffalo race held in the south-western part of Karnataka, India. It was originally called  Karaga Festival and dated back to thousands of years.\nThe ground of such a thrilling festival is a fest for the photographers, composing of various shots and scenes.\nEDITION  : 1/1",
