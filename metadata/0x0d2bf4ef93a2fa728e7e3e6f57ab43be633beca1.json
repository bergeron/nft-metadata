    "description": "A reimagining of CryptoPunk 4736 as a pirate flag. With inspiration taken from PIV's \"X-ray of CryptoPunk 130\" and and Saucedo's \"JOLLY ROGER(S)â„¢\" series, I wanted to explore a customized pirate themed standard for personal use. \n\nI've used various skulls and crossbones on websites, business cards and personal branding for decades. This simplified rendition of a pixel pirate makes reference to the fictionalized idea of \"piracy\" inherent to many parts of internet culture to which I have a deep emotional connection.",
