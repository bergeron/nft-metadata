    "description": "The theyyam is an embodiment of the Kandanar Kelan and how he shows his anger towards the fire for burning him up. The theyyam very prominently has two snakes drawn on his chest that depict the snakes that perished with him in the fire. Kandanar Kelan runs through the fire dressed in his silk and wearing metal anklets, perhaps the only theyyam to do so.\n\nPeople can only watch the dangerous performance of Kandanar Kelan by holding their breath.",
