    "description": "streetlights was created last fall during a time of great transition in my life. seeking nostalgia in my art has always been a common theme, but I think I return to it especially whenever life gets weird because it's a safe place for me. streetlights, in particular, remind me of my early childhood and of looking for a safe place in my late teen years to hang out with friends, bike around, take photos, and enjoy life for what it was before everything became so serious. when I revisited this piece knowing I wanted to mint it, my main goal was to emphasize that feeling. I hope it makes you feel the same way it does for me.\n\nmake sure to come back home before the streetlights come on",
