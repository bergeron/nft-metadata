    "description": "NFT item \"The Best or Nothing (Mercedes)\" puts an end to the choice of what you agree to - to be like everyone else or to be special, worthy of the best.\n\nThe photo shows: an arch door made of 3D security ribbons of one hundred dollar bills, Mercedes car ignition key. The main words here are \"key\" and \"door\". This picture symbolizes the key to the door. Behind this door is a life full of prosperity.\n\nIn the “Money & Success” collection, on the wave of luck, effortlessly, we take photos of money and the attributes of success, most of them in the genre of post-irony. Our creative studio creates unique and rare works of art - illustrations and photographs.\n\nArtstudio KNUTOW is named after a talented photo artist with a non-trivial view of modern art and culture, so our works are in demand and are growing in price.",
