    "description": "Poetry isn’t dead. You’ll have to kill me. \n\nA collection of 23 paintings painted over the course of a two year span. I matched these paintings to a song I produced and recorded in Logic Pro using midi devices, a microphone, and a plethora of samples found from various corners of the internet. \n\nThis project is an accumulation of my greatest works in all three categories of music, painting, and poetry. \n\nI really hope you enjoy :) \n\nThank you. \n\n-petewater ",
