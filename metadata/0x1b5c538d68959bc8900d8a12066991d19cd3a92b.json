    "description": "â€œPerhaps those faces return, we open the glass box and see the bright fire, our first hidden mirrors, and we are reflected there, in our own image, with red lips from that mouth, which seems trapped by that irresistible desire to bite into infinity.\"\n\nThis piece reflects two faces in one, as a complement. It is the elegance of red. It may be our duality, always being in the game of opposites. Good and evil, light and dark, light and shadow.\nOne way to obtain the truth may be to scrutinize everything and take it to the purifying fire, that spiritual fire within us, that sleeps invisibly in everything.\n\nMixed technique. acrylic on paper, then vectorized and drawn digitally.
