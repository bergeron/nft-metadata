    "description": "“Anyone whose major concern is the sanctity of human life is in effect, by leaving population growth unchecked, ensuring death by famine. \nNature is pitiless, and if humans will not themselves limit population then they will have it done for them.” \n\n― Christopher Hitchens \n\nMy art is a fusion of contemporary and 17th century realism mixed with bits of digital abstractions. \nTo show that art is connected through time, no matter the tools used.\n\nFile size: 5333 × 8000",
