    "description": "The Golden age of Mountaineering reached its pinnacle during Ser Pepe Hillary's adventurous exploits, & this photograph captured by his esteemed climbing partner, Hamzing Norgay, is a rare mid-journey glimpse into their heroic first ascent of Everest. Recently found in an old diary amongst base camp litter, this photograph frozen & forgotten on the mountain, has finally been thawed, reproduced, & limitedly released to the public.\n\n*All sales of this token will go towards the funding of an art expedition in Guatemala where I will be conducting field research for my upcoming collection, \"Codex Appalachia\". Thank you in advance for your support!",
