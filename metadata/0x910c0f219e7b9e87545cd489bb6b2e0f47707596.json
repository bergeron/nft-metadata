    "description": "Long explores the evolution of midcentury modern living in one dynamic movement with the help of artificial intelligence and stable diffusion.\n\n:54sec MP4  \n1080x1620  \n24FPS\n\n---  \nMakeitrad is a Los Angeles based artist, designer and pixel manipulator whose work examines finding the organic beauty of Nature while being trapped in a world of technology. He often uses artificial intelligence and machine learning but also embraces ideas of randomness and noise to drive the final forms. With his incredible ability to find inspiration through the lens of a child, the result is insightful and inspiring artwork that is also vibrant, innocent, and fun.",
