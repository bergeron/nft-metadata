    "description": "This is the first in an experimental series. I wanted to find new ways to bring in color so I used chalk and charcoal on the paper before cutting. I had no idea what the piece would look like until I finished cutting and flipped it over for the first time. I’m in love with this process!\n\nThe other experimental part of this series is the position of the subjects … I definitely broke some rules and it was totally worth it!\n\nMade from two parts: Hand-cut paper foreground with chalk and charcoal.\n\nThe background is canvas with acrylic paint, chalk, and charcoal.\n\nMedium: Mixed media\n\nMaterials: Acid-free mix media paper, Chalk, Charcoal, Acrylic paint, Canvas",
