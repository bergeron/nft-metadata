    "description": " -For some, art is beautiful flowers with blue sky. For some, a portrait of a beautiful woman in a harsh light. For me, a detail in the dark is an idea that rises in blood. To remember where I've come from maybe a trace from me to the life. \n-Everyone's story and path is different, that's what makes this world beautiful. \nBloody Lotus is your pain, your success, your experiences. It's you.\n\"Art comes from joy and pain...But mostly from pain.\"",
