    "description": "Mongo Mugs 2.5 exists as the culmination of process that happened owing to a sentence said to me by Jessica Yatrofsky while we were discussing my AI project, Pepeverse, and the response to my first AI NFT project by close friends. In saying it, a thorn that had been aggravating me for so long was yanked from my heart and it stole my breath. So this art is for you. I love you, always. Jessica Yatrofsky is my muse.",
