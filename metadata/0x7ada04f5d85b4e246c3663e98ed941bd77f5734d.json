    "description": "East Side is a record I wrote with Oliver Malcolm, one of my best friends and also one of my favorite artists.  He's produced songs for me like Heartstrings with Carlos Santana and Ghosts Around Midnight.  We made it in one day and wanted to capture minimalism within a record.  There were so many opportunities to over produce this record, to add booming drums, to do the most...  And after playing with it for months we all agreed that the first day's version - which just features me playing and singing on the guitar, my brother Sol's infectious bass line, and Oliver's short appearance - was the one.  The song is about precisely what the lyrics are talking about.  Growing up on the east coast in Trumbull, Connecticut, I spent a lot of months admiring the ruthlessness of the winter and the feeling that winter has left me with has lingered in my sounds for as long as i've been creating.  Even after years of being in the California sun, the cold wevva on the east side has left its imprint on me.\n\n",
