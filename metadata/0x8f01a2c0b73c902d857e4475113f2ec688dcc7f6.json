    "description": "I adore children’s books. The great care they take. The simplicity of the language juxtaposed against the complex image of life. The heartbeat rhythm of the words read aloud, being held in the lap of the story. The “and then,… and then,… and then…” of life. The uncurling of a lesson that has been learned, and will be learned again. There is no better pairing for our round and closed human language than an image drunk and drowning in the chaotic endless openness of human consciousness. What could be the lull of sleep – if not, that is for the bright and glorious pictures!",
