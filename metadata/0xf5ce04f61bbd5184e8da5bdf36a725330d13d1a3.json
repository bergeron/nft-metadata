    "description": "What is childhood? It's a great time. The time when all the knowledge, impressions and emotions a person experiences gets absorbed. Everything seems so colorful and beautiful. The child learns, loves, admires everything around. You know that your parents are always there to protect you. You know this and therefore you are calm and happy. Beautiful and fascinating time. The time when we can calmly study, develop and build our future character. For this we must say thank you to our wonderful parents who loved us the most on this earth. And our duty is to do everything so that our children have the opportunity to be happy and develop calmly in the most beautiful time in our lifes - The Childhood.",
