    "name": "Shadows on the Riverwalk",
    "description": "The San Antonio Riverwalk is a marvel of engineering. The initial plans drawn up in 1929, it took eight years of lobbying to be approved. The project was completed in 1941.\nThe space is almost always full of people.\nI was able to make it down one morning before the normal hustle, and capture some shots.\nIsolating the area without people gives this normally very busy section a feeling that normally doesn't exist.  \n",
