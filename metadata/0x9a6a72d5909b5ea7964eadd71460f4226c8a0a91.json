    "description": "Accursed Share is proud to present Captured Moment: The Master’s Process, the first NFT collection by photographer-to-the-stars Frederic Auerbach. The collection consists of NFT drops of process and master photos (1/1s) of five A-listers, plus airdrops. The stars in this collection are Benedict Cumberbatch, Natalie Portman, Sharon Stone, Mike Tyson and Zendaya.\n\nThe Process Series reveals the delicate behind-the-scenes construction required for the production of a Master work. It includes 1,700 NFTs of 30 unique photographs and 5 animations of different rarity (143, 100, 50, 25, 10, 7, 5).\n\nFor the Master Series, each celebrity will have their own NFT suite, including: the high-res digital photo NFT of the Master photo (one per star); a dynamic NFT of that same Master photo displaying various edits of the image at different times of day; and a unique video NFT of the behind-the-scenes interview detailing Auerbach’s creative approach, from Process to Master. The buyer will also receive a high-res and autographed print of the Master photo they purchased. \n\nThe Master photo of Benedict Cumberbatch is a 1/1 high-res digital photo NFT of the actor taken by Frederic Auerbach for GQ in 2014. It is described in our webpage as follows:\n\n“These photos were taken for GQ UK in 2014, when Cumberbatch was in the heat of his fame, coming off Season 3 of the acclaimed BBC adaptation of Sherlock. He was in Boston, filming Scott Cooper’s Black Mass—the Whitey Bulger crime drama with Johnny Depp—so expectations were great, time was of the essence, and timing—as ever—eternal. \n\nCumberbatch arrived at the shoot unescorted and unattended, in an immaculately tailored suit, with only a scarf for a prop. Simplicity is his elegance, which is not to say he is in any way staid. Of the models featured in Accursed Share’s Auerbach series, he is the most animated, and his process photos show a man who finds great joy in movement and who likes to have fun with the camera. Auerbach, of course, reciprocates, and what is captured in this session is a sort of dance at a distance between both men, conducted with vim and kinetic good humour. \n\nThere is an insuppressibility to Cumberbatch that borders on uproariousness but never steps on toes. His uncanny physical self-mastery, best appreciated in his work for theatre—think of his alternating roles as Victor and the Creature in Danny Boyle’s 2011 Frankenstein—is fully manifest in this outstanding shoot. \n\nAuerbach grasps the corybant in Cumberbatch in a photo session that is reminiscent of Robert Longo’s Men in the Cities, had that series been not about urban alienation, but premised on sheer, dramatic exultance.”\nCredits: Photography: Frederic Auerbach / Filmography: Gary Grenier / Producers: Accursed Share (Mónica Belevan, John Thomas Connor, Marcus de Ataide); André Antonelli, Frederic Auerbach, Eric Holdener / Engineer: Marcus de Ataide / Animation: Filipe Oto Medeiros \n\nCaptured Moment: The Master’s Process is an Accursed Share production, in association with Frederic Auerbach. \n\nPart of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Farm2People, Los Angeles.",
