    "description": "If you are born a woman, you have more opportunities in life from the very beginning. It's easier for you to break through in sports, easier to climb the career ladder, easier to become a sought-after artist, you can do nothing, men will do it for you, you won't die in a war at 18\n\nBut this image of a woman is heavily framed. Society will judge you more often than men. You will face a lot of sexism and violence. God forbid you get a tattoo on your face, to society you will immediately become a whore. Shave your head, you're a lesbian. Wear a short dress - hundreds of people will be think how hard they would fuck you\n\nMany people want to be a woman because sometimes it's easier to achieve something, but men don't understand what it is to walk down a dark alley and fear for your life, what it is to be born in a Muslim country, and what it is to be persecuted just because you don't reciprocate with another person\n\n(There are exceptions everywhere, and this judgment applies only to Russia)",
