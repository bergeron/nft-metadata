    "description": "One Thousand and Two Nights are the first night after a Millennium that the photographer leaves behind to face himself and the new world in front of him. Here the artist has faced questions – about the resulting changes in the coordinates of space and time. – Where time supposed to be born along now and of the past. What would be the result if the past extends into the future? Are we going to be able to reconstruct the characteristics of today's aesthetics, speed, and transient? What would be the result of such transformation? Can we figure it will only apply to prospective and without perspective, the world of their construction, light engineering in today and rebuild?\nThe photographer is creating a new world of social time axis that results from images of the unknown.",
