    "description": "By now you've probably realized that AI can fully replace the NFT Influencer. (a thread 🧵 )\n\nAfter only receiving limited contextual inputs, I was able to generate a convincing video that is nearly indistinguishable from 90% of NFT Influencers.\n\nHere's how I did it 👇🏾 \n\nI listened to a bunch of NFT Influencers shovel shit into the wallets of Normies who had just entered the NFT Community for 2 years.\n\nI wrote a script based on that. I'd suggest starting with ChatGPT now, but it doesn't write like this yet. Use a custom data set.\n\nI used an AI SaaS product to render my script into proof that we live in a simulation. \n\n- Text to Speaking AI Avatar (Human option was avail, but I liked her attitude!)\n- \"NFT\" images are stock but AI art would work\n- Browser-based video instant edit\n- Everything in the video is fully licensed for my commercial use, including owning the IP I create\n\nThis is art by JL. 🎨  \n\nMy first release on Foundation. Thank you for your support! I love my community! 💜",
