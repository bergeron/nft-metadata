    "description": "A pod of Spinner Dolphins (Stenella longirostris) bow-riding just beneath the surface in the waters of the Sulu Sea, Philippines.\n\nDolphins are known to bow-ride fast-moving craft, and it's fun to photograph them above and in the water. To take this photo I leaned over the bow (front) of our speeding chase boat and dipped my camera underwater, firing blindly as we ripped across the pristine waters of the Sulu Sea.\n\nCetaceans like dolphins are incredibly intelligent, sentient, and self-aware animals that have complex family structures and require the freedom of the ocean within which to move. Orcas, dolphins, and whales have long been contained for purposes of human entertainment and “education”—a horrifyingly torturous experience of having to live in small tanks and perform for the rest of their lives. \n\n2002x3000px\n\nPhotographed by Noel Guevara in 2016. Noel is a conservation photographer & filmmaker based in Manila, Philippines.",
