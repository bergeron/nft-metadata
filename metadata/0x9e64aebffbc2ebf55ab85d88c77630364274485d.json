    "description": "Social issues are one of the main themes of my art. In this work I rethought the image of Themis, goddess of justice in Greek mythology, based on nowadays realities. \nUnfortunately, in this world money has become the measure of guilt and innocence. A moneybag who has committed a crime can avoid prosecution because on the scales of Themis his money will always outweigh any charges. The same way money can become the reason why an innocent person can be punished for a crime he didn’t commit.\nI really hope that this work will make someone think about what’s happening around these days.\n\nModel: Ekaterina.
