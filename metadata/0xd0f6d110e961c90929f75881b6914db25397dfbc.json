    "description": "This piece is inspired on my first oil painting to be shown on a museum. The painting was exposed in the Leonora Carrington Museum and is now on a private collection. \n\n\"Don´t tell the bride\" became a part of this series as it is a metaphor that opens itself to the interpretation of the viewer; colors and shapes that abstract everything intangible about the main character. A subject that I have been exploring throughout my career.\n\nThis NFT serves as a certificate of authenticity for the physical piece. The first collector to get it, will receive the original serigraphy, framed, signed and certified.    ",
