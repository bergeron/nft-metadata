    "description": "OE of the cover art of FOMA mag special edition, curated by V. Ruins. The artwork features the titular signature of Ruins, the Posse. \nThese rat like creatures reppresent the subconscious of the artist and visualizes the concept expressed by Fyodor Dostoevsky in 'Notes from the Underground', of a man like a rat, tormented by its own subconscious. The Posse first appeared in the 'PossPorts 2.0' community collection for the service DAO SewerNation.  \nCollecting this NFT allows participation in the raffle for the limited edition physical version of the mag.",
