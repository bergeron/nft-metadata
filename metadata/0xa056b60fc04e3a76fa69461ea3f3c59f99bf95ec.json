    "description": "In an exceptional setting, at the foot of the famous Chantilly castle and the Grand Stables of the Princes Condé, The Diane Prize, this glamorous horse race is a combination of sporting performance and feminine elegance, it is one of the most fashionable events in the world. Since 1843, fashionistas in extraordinary hats have come here to rub shoulders with experts in galloping races. The Diane Prize offers nine horse races that are run at breakneck speed. The prize is awarded to the best European filly on a distance of 2,100 metres, at an average speed of 60 km/hour. A chic lunch on the grass and a free concert are organised on the lawn. The event attracts around 30,000 visitors every year.\n\nResolution: 300 pixels/inch\nDimensions: 4724 pix. X 4724 pix.\n\n",
