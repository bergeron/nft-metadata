    "description": "Activity: use your hand to cover any half of the face and see the wonders.\n\nThis beautiful piece is a mixed media made with Graphite, Charcoal and Acrylic paint on Paper(The pink background). When you look closely you will discover there are two faces of a male and a female with eyes of love and a  venomous serpent in their mouth. \n\nThe beauty of life is in love for one another. Love is kindness, love is life. No man is an island, we need one another. The pink shows a world of innocence, passion, love, and romance. But life has become like an horror movie for many people.  Many come with eyes of love yet their words are like serpents. so poisonous that it doesn't only hurts but has killed many.  This piece will mean many things to many people. I want every viewer to resonate with this piece. Irrespective of the hurts of life, we must never stop loving but please we should be careful. The world is a place of good and evil.",
