    "description": "Life… It’s a paradox. We are here, at this moment, as a result of the causes and effects of the conditions that are both dependent and independent to one another. For every moment we have, there is a cause… and there is an effect. These moments shaped who we are and brought us to the exact point we are now. You might feel you’re in full control of the life you’re living. Not quite so. You just trigger the mechanism of life with the choices you make. Your future, it is being shaped at this very moment. You can take a wild guess and try to foresee what will happen, but there is no knowing for sure what future will bring you. You might end up walking on a wondrous path or another you would not have even imagined.\n\nThus, think about the choices you’re about to make.\nShape up your future.\n\n70x50 Acrylic \n\nCanvas will be sent to the address of the owner.",
