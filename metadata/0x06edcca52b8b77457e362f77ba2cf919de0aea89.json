    "description": "“They have no speech, they use no words;  \n    no sound is heard from them.\n\nYet their voice goes out into all the earth,  \n    their words to the ends of the world.”\n\nThe piece was constructed from pictures taken at the Atacama Desert. This is the most arid desert of the world, yet in the highlands of this territory it snows when the conditions are right. These three wandering clouds represent a community of three people traveling through the snowed desert. If the viewer looks carefully, the clouds actually form one big cloud, they are all connected. Symbolically, three people represent the presence of God. Being part of a community can be a powerful antidote against desolation. Text taken from Psalm 19.",
