    "description": "\"are you having Fun?\" is the first piece in my newest collection \"ABRdFiles.\" This picture was the product of incredible luck; it wasn't until I'd received the scans back from processing that I saw a seagull had flown across the frame when the picture was taken. \n\nABRDFiles is an homage to my time abroad in Copenhagen thus far. \n\nShot on Ultramax 400.\n\n",
