    "description": "Motivated by anxieties about the soullessness of manufacturing and its products, as well as about art's lack of purpose in society, Bauhaus sought to unite form and function by reinventing designs of everyday life. Its original curriculum attached a great importance to functionalism through simplified, geometric forms, and linked fine arts and crafts to the goal of solving problem in a modern industrial society.",
