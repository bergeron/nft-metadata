    "description": "Nine victories, fourteen pole positions, eight fastest laps. This helmet saw it all. It has a special place in Nigel’s heart since it's the lucky charm that he wore throughout that incredibly dominant 1992 championship winning year. He closed the season ahead of teammate Riccardo Patrese and Michael Schumacher, while Williams also secured the Constructors’s Championship.<br /><br />Nigel Mansell “I was in love with this helmet... I just look at it and it brings back my most fantastic memory”.",
