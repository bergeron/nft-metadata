    "description": "The possibilities are endless when I set my pen to my paper or my tablet. I can create whole worlds and beings within them. Who will I breathe life into? Where will their adventures lead them?  In our minds we are the makers, shapers and builders. Open your mind to the magic within. We stand at the edge of a new world as explorers facing the endless universe of imagination. We are the pioneers of this new landscape. We as artists stand together creating something new each time we enter our minds. It is more than making art to sell. We are putting our hearts, our souls and whole beings into each piece. Let's create something beautiful, and fantastical together.\n\nLove, Mari\n\nMari's Artworks: http://linktr.ee/hellomarimon",
