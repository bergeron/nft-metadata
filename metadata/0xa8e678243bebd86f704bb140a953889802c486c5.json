    "description": "YOU and I have found the secret way,\nNone can bar our love or say us nay:\nAll the world may stare and never know\nYou and I are twined together so.\n\nYou and I for all his vaunted width\nKnow the giant Space is but a myth;\nOver miles and miles of pure deceit\nYou and I have found our lips can meet.\n\nYou and I have laughed the leagues apart\nIn the soft delight of heart to heart.\nIf thereâ€™s a gulf to meet or limit set,\nYou and I have never found it yet.\n\nYou and I have trod the backward way\nTo the happy heart of yesterday,\nTo the love we felt in ages past.\nYou and I have found it still to last.\n\nYou and I have found the joy had birth\nIn the angel childhood of the earth,\nHid within the heart of man and maid.\nYou and I of Time are not afraid.\n\nYou and I can mock his fabled wing,\nFor a kiss is an immortal thing.\nAnd the throb wherein those old lips met\nIs a living music in us yet.\n\nGeorge William Russell\n\nAffinity depicts the connection between humans and nature.",
