    "description": "This project was inspired by the iconic profile picture that you see on Facebook or Twitter when you first create a profile - a simple, greyed-out silhouette. This profile picture, a classic, is both simple and beautiful, as opposed to the complex and busy ones. That is what makes it timeless. We celebrate the power of simplicity and believe that a bored profile picture can be just as famous and renowned as any other. It's all about the shape and form - the elegant simplicity that makes this profile picture so iconic.",
