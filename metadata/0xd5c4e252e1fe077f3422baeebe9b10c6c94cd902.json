    "description": " I am for world peace.  What is happening now in my country is inhuman, terrible, unacceptable.  Such events should not occur in the modern world, but they do occur.\n With this art work, I express how strong Ukrainians are, our people will endure everything, cope with any difficulties.  After the darkest night comes the dawn!\n I want every person on earth to be happy and not know the grief that Ukraine is now experiencing.\n\n I will donate most of the funds for humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as assistance to my relatives and friends.",
