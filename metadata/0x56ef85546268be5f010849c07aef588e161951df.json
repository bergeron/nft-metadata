    "description": "The abyss into which you are flying is a terrible abyss, a dangerous abyss. He who falls into it never feels the bottom. He falls, he falls without end. It happens to people who, at some point in their lives, begin to seek what their familiar surroundings cannot give them. Or rather, they thought they could find nothing for themselves in their familiar surroundings. So they stopped looking. They stopped looking, without even trying to find anything. -  The Catcher in the Rye (J. D. Salinger)",
