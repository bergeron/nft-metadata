    "description": "Fridays at The Park \n\nCreated on a Friday with friends at the legendary Valentine Studios in Los Angeles, CA ⌐◨-◨  thepark.wtf \n\nWe've been hosting these lunches, conversations, jams, collaborations, collective creation moments around music + art for almost two years now, and have more recently started filming them, streaming some, and sharing the process in new ways.  All with this heart of creating more music, more art and artifacts onchain together.  This music mint will be an 0xSlits with the park DAO, deployed using Nouns Builder, with the majority percentage going back to the park DAO address.  Say what?! Let's talk about it, together on a Friday soon.  Living everyday together like it's Friday.\n\nHappy Friday\n\n⌐Ⓗ-Ⓕ \n\n\nMusicians: \nTOBi\nChloe Angelides \nTim Anderson \nBeing There\nJosh Lippi\nBen Schwier \nDerek Taylor\n\nEngineers: \nMaddi StJohn\nTravis Pavur \n",
