    "description": "A tattoo carries certain meaning or significance to the person having it. The million dollar question is, what if the tattoo is badly drawn by the Tattoo Artist?\n\nThis was the case with African rapper Show Yoh. The rapper recently tattooed his idol, father and mentor in the music world \"50 Cent\" on his back to celebrate him. The tattoo was badly drawn, but despite the outcome, Show Yoh still decided to share the photo of the tattoo on his official instragram and Facebook page, which went viral and had thousands of reactions across all social media platforms. The photo has thousands of funny comments and has been liked and viewed by millions of people around the world.\n\nThe rapper has gained thousands of fans since the photo went viral including 50 CENT who posted the \"Father and Son Tattoo\" photo, on his official instagram page.\n\nThe significance of the \"Father and Son Tattoo\" photo is that, \"No matter the outcome, if you celebrate others, you will be celebrated\".",
