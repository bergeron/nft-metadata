    "description": "Documentary photography of the historical process of decay of one of the most important cities of Latin America: Caracas. Digital photography. 3648 px x 2736 px. One (1) JPG file. 1/1 artwork.\nIncludes original fine art Hahnem√ºhle copy (30cm x 23cm). Contact azaliad.licons@gmail.com for worldwide shipping arrangement.     \n\nThis is silent scream of the unfortunate times I've had to live due to the political dynamics of my country, some of them, built even before I was born. So I've dedicated part of my photographic career to try to understand this world, this country and myself submerged in this madness. \n\nThis is a first search for answers to try to understand a loss, the loss of the innocence, the loss of the dreams of a whole generation, full of hope and crushed by the circumstances that none of us foresaw, lurked by the shadows of a cursed patriotic past. \n",
