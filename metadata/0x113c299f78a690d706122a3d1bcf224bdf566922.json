Nick | Honey & Roses / (Nick Cave)\n\n\"I found her on a night of fire and noise / Wild bells rang in a wild sky / I knew from that moment on / That I'd love her till the day that I died / And I kissed away a thousand tears / My lady of the Various Sorrows / Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen / Some kept safe for tomorrow / On and endless night, silver star spangled / The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle / Do you love me?\"",
