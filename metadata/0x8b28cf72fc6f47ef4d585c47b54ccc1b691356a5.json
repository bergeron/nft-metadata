    "description": "My third collection, Love Is More Than Just A Kiss, was shot entirely with analog and polaorids. While taking the photos, I get excited about not being able to see the results at that moment, then washing them in the dark room and seeing the results slowly, and every time I scan, I feel like I take a photo for the first time. I believe that every photograph has its own story, its own energy. I am happy to share my new collection with the unique colors and light of each photo.Enjoy!",
