    "description": "A collaboration between Meander Quest & Christophe Jr.\n\n\"In a calm ocean, every human is a great navigator. It's the unfavorable environments that determine a good pilot.\"\n\nOur perception of situations can sometimes be misleading. We might see ourselves doing great work in life until someone comes along and show us what true greatness stands for.\n\nChoosing moments of unpredictability and unfavorable conditions is not what every human would do. But then, some great souls go through hours of training, discipline to help others and make a life that is worth living.\n\nWhat we see, know or read about the life of BlackHawk Pilots is just the tip of the iceberg.",
