    "description": "When I was making “ Come Over Some Time\" I was trying to capture the emotions of getting closer with someone. There’s just something awesome about the first stages of meeting a person, realizing you like them, then wanting to feel more because everything feels right. Hopefully “Come Over Some Time” helps somebody get a certain feeling out without having to convey it too much vocally. Definitely an afternoon car ride song for two people on the edge of falling in love. \n",
