    "description": "In every religion, there is a special set of beliefs about the supernatural and the afterlife that affect the mental structure. In Dante Alighieri's Inferno, part of the Divine Comedy, Malebolge (/mælˈboʊldʒ/) is the eighth circle of Hell. Roughly translated from Italian, Malebolge means \"evil ditches\". Malebolge is a large, funnel-shaped cavern, itself divided into ten concentric circular trenches or ditches. Each trench is called a bolgia (Italian for \"pouch\" or \"ditch\"). Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell.The eighth floor, which is one of the most complex classes of hell and its description covers almost one third of all hell, includes the sins of fraud, deception, misguidance and evil, the sins of which are simpler than the next category. This is a class that includes the people of treachery, hypocrisy and deception.\n",
