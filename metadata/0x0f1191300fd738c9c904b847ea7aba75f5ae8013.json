    "name": "A walk in Louvre Abu Dhabi",
    "description": "A double dome 180 meters in diameter, offering horizontal, perfectly radiating geometry, a randomly perforated woven material, providing shade punctuated by bursts of sun. The dome gleams in the Abu Dhabi sunshine. At night, this protected landscape is an oasis of light under a starry dome.\n\nLouvre Abu Dhabi becomes the final destination of an urban promenade, a garden on the coast, a cool haven, a shelter of light during the day and evening, it's aesthetic consistent with its role as a sanctuary for the most precious works of art.‚Äù",
