    "description": "5-way Collaboration with the entire Everdream Studio crew. Nathan (N8) Miers assembled the pieces while adding his signature space sections. AdamG added his signature fume honeycomb to the pinch and slide, Elbo added his Dino flip, Eusheen added his signature wigwag patterns, and WJC created the flips in the faceted cab and on the ash catcher. The accenting transparent orange color is called Terps. This piece was started in 2021 and finished in 2022 at Everdream Studio in Evergreen, Colorado. Photograph by THC_Samuel. The intent of this NFT is to accompany the piece wherever it goes, and to serve as digital provenance.",
