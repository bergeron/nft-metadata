    "description": "Adam Kostandy is a cinematographer, filmmaker, and coder. \n\nHere is a photo of Adam Kostandy during one of our rehearsals for the film, \"The Keys.\" Adam Is the only cinematographer I've worked with on any of my movies. Working with Adam has always been a blessing. Adam can quickly adapt and fix issues, saving me multiple times on set. Over the years, I felt like working with Adam was like taking a crash course on cinematography. I've learned a lot from him.\n\nWe don't see or talk to each other unless we're working on a project together, but strangely I have an unusual amount of trust in him. It's just one of those relationships that you appreciate. There have been opportunities where I could have worked with a different cinematographer for my films, but I always stuck with Adam. The idea of potentially working with another cinematographer upsets me.\n\nâ–ºhttps://www.instagram.com/diabeatz96/",
