    "description": "House of Consent is a visual art project by Lucine (AKA Madam Frog) that combines blockchain technology and storytelling to promote consent awareness. With a mission to empower the feminine and inspire the masculine, House of Consent aims to make consent a normalized concept in our society. Through partnerships and products, House of Consent holds space for ongoing conversations about consent and its importance in all aspects of life.\n\nThe Genesis is a unique collection that adds a Wild Card element to the overall project. The Genesis collection consists of only 7 editions, each with a main image and three rotating images. The rotating images, including Princess Frog Kiss, Pomegranate, and Fireflies, each have their own \"privileges\" that interact with blockchain collections and offer unique utility within the House of Consent project. The number of Madam Frog PFP NFT mint-outs/sales determine the rotation of the images, making each edition a rare and noteworthy collectible.\n\nPlease visit Lucine\\'s website for an in-depth description on the utility of each privilege and how it works.\n\n[www.lucinevisions.art](https://www.lucinevisions.art/)",
