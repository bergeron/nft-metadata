    "description": "Playa De Los Muertos - One of the most famous beaches at Cabo de Gata-Níjar, Andalusia, Spain. \n\nShort story about this photo - it was taken back in summer 2020 when the whole world was on halt. Since it was hard to travel by plane, i decided to go on a road trip to Spain and discover the marvellous region of Andalusia known for its unique desert landscapes, strong culture and sunny beaches with crystal-clear waters on the Mediterranean Sea surrounded by rocky cliffs . \n\nThis place gets its name, which means \"Beach of the Dead\" from the fact that it was once used as a cemetery by the ancient Romans. Despite its name, Playa de los Muertos is a lively and beautiful place to visit.\n\n\nLICENSE - Extended Editorial  \nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
