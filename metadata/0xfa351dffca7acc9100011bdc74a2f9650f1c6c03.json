    "description": "\"In a Hatbeat\" (2019) is part of our viral series \"What the Hat?!\", in which our aim is to keep celebrating the extraordinary untold stories behind certain everyday objects. In this case, hats. \n\nOur images might look like illustrations, and yet they are actually photographs created with very little digital editing. As a matter of fact, we ourselves take care of every detail to achieve that particular look and feel: from the brainstorming, to the location scouting, to the prop making, to the actual shooting of the image and everything else in between, most of the times even featuring in it. It must be true what they say: artists do wear many hats. Pun intended.",
