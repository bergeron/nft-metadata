    "description": "Luminaris Abstractia - I \n\nThis piece was exhibited April 13th, 2023, with the Latent Dreams event, curated by Blac.ai and Joyn.xyz, alongside the Pho's Spiral and Derivatives event, during NFT NYC, at The NFT Gallery, 88 Clinton St. NY.\n\nThis piece is the first of my LA series and combines my traditional paintings and digital abstracts as reference + my ai figuratives, in that tropic-coastal aesthetic I love so much. Original works are blended with ai to conceptualize figures and composition, and then overpainted in photoshop, pushing the boundaries and experimentation of my artistic style to date. Luminaris Abstractia is a story that explores the visual expression of the felt and seen experience of dreams.",
