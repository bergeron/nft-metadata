    "description": "I have been traveling to the forests of North Asia on the border of Iran and Azerbaijan for many years to photograph the endangered Hyrcanian Caspian forests. The silence and foggy depths of the Hyrcanian forests always fascinate me and bring me closer to my roots. I feel we are all rooted in nature and inspired by it.\n\nI always travel to these forests in autumn for photography. \nI captured this photo in the heights of \"Dohazar\" region in \"Shahsavar\" City forests.\n\nThe Hyrcanian forests  are a zone of lush lowland and montane forests covering about 55,000 square kilometres adjoining the shores of the Caspian Sea of Iran and part of that of Azerbaijan. The forest is named after the ancient region of Hyrcania. In the World Wildlife Fund categorization, the ecoregion is referred to as the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests.\n\nSince 5 July 2019, the Hyrcanian Forests have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\n\nJPEG image\nEdition: 1/1\nSize 3000 * 2000 px",
