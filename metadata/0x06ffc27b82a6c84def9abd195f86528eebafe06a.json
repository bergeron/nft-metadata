    "description": "It's called Marnfand, it's a type of demonic beast in the species of Dream Eater. It was a magical beast with the ability to eat both good and bad dreams. It will appear up where there is a dream, when it eats a dream that dream will last forever. It was the creature that was the beginning of building a garden to feed it. On a sweet night, this magical beast came to me. And ask me to feed it, I try to feed my dreams every good night. Since that day, it has become my pet.\n\nINOON (2022)\n10000x8000 px",
