    "description": "It is easy to feel unnoticed in a fast-paced environment.\n\n\"Your value doesn’t decrease based on someone’s inability to see your worth” - Zig Ziegler\n\nIt can be frustrating to feel unseen, especially when you are working hard and putting in the effort. It is vital to remember that our value and worth are not determined by others' perceptions of us or by external circumstances. We have value and our inherent worth does not depend on external approval.\n\nFocus on what you see in yourself and strive to achieve your dreams and passions. This can be challenging, especially when you are facing obstacles or setbacks. Nonetheless, it is critical to stay motivated and to keep working towards your goals, treating yourself with kindness, patience, and understanding.\n\nKeep working hard, trust yourself, and don't give up! You have the potential to make a positive impact and achieve remarkable things. I believe this and I encourage you to concentrate on achieving your goals!\n\n\"Unseen\" is a self-portrait by Abrahanny.",
