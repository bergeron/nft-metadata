    "name": "The Kitchen",
    "description": "The sound of glass shatters against the cool night air. A meatball rolls softly against the floor, silencing the room. The nights dinner lays splattered, spaghetti splashed next to broken plates. But he pretends not to hear it. The TV blares as he drowns in its sound, hoping to escape the terrors of the kitchen. The glow of the TV illuminates him in the night like a beacon of hope. He forces himself to focus on the mysterious world in front of him. \n\nAs the program changes, he briefly sees his own reflection on the screen, a smile growing across his face. He imagines himself like the people in the TV, fighting battles and saving lives. He imagines himself as the heroes he admires. He imagines himself as anyone other than person reflected back at him.
