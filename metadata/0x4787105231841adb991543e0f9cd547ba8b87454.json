    "description": "The Hamsa hand stands for the energy fields of your body and your five senses. Hamsa is a place where different cultures come together. In this place you have nothing to fear: what remains is your peace of mind. Namaste.\n\nThe lotus flower stands for strength to free yourself from difficult situations and to use them constructively. Like the flower, which courageously makes its way out of her bud and beads everything that burdens her on its beauty. In order to love other beings, we must first love, respect, value and respect ourselves!",
