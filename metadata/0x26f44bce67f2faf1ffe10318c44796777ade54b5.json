    "description": "The artwork is the first piece of \"Death of Concepts\".\n\nIt represents the day music dies. The concept of music is left somewhere desolate.\n\nPeople are just watching it diminish. It is hanging on a tree that is either dead or alive.\n\nThis remains unknown to most. And one truth emerges from all other facts. \n\nIt is prerogative of brave and sophisticated ones to tell about its annihilation.\n\nD.T.",
