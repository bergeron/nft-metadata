    "description": "The Wimbledon Final on July 5th, 1980 between Björn Borg and John McEnroe is regarded as one of the most iconic sports events in history. In this NFT titled “No Time to Think”, Björn Borg has captured his emotional experience in the moment he won his historic fifth consecutive title.\nAn exclusive video interview was conducted with Björn Borg to understand how he felt throughout the event. This video served as inspiration to digital artist duo Ximena, who were commissioned to create an audiovisual piece expressing Björn’s emotional experience and a statue depicting his final moment of “Serenity”. The artistic work has been curated by Marisa Bellani, art prodigy and youngest member ever of the TATE Acquisition Board\nTo understand the external view and impact of the moment, a historical description has also been produced by tennis expert Björn Hellberg who was present at the event.\nThe interview, artwork and historical description can be viewed separately or as a whole in a virtual room, together with the contract where Björn Borg personally validates his personal experience and authenticates the NFT.\nAll parts combine to form a one-of-a-kind, single edition Emotional NFT minted on the Ethereum Blockchain.",
