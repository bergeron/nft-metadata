    "description": "The otherworldly landscapes of White Pocket could easily be mistaken for the moon. In this remote area in Utah you can catch a true glimpse of the distant stars and galaxies, unobstructed by light pollution of our planet.\n\nMission to the Moon was created almost by accident, discovering only after taking this self portrait that the shutter on the camera was open before I ran out in front of it. Experimenting with light painting always results in unique results, and this image is one my favorites to date.  ",
