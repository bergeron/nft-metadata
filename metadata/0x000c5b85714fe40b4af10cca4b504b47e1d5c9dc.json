    "description": "<p>Revival of Aesthetics - A.I. Driven Immersive New Media Art Experience. Each NFT is representing one chapter from the exhibition, meaning the collector owns part of the exhibition. </p> \n\n<p>With the rise of the digital age, the importance of adopting the past for the future is crucially important to save our heritage from disappearing. Revival of Aesthetics, an art exhibition by Orkhan Mammadov works on the representations of the Middle Eastern cultural history to secure dialogue between the future and the past, dystopia and utopian. Hosted by Theater of Digital Art Dubai and co-curated by the Generative Gallery, the exhibition aims at creating imaginary rugs that didn’t exist so far by combining the data painting technique, pattern, symbol recognition, thread simulation & color data. While honoring the term “pattern” traditionally; Mammadov merges this term with its usage in today’s world; machine algorithms that recognize regularities in data. In honor of colliding the past and future of carpets; during the experience, visitors will be able to witness current locations and uses of the embroideries all over the world, while simultaneously allowing them to step into the new world of metaverse without losing connection with the ancient roots. </p>\n\n<p>The collector will receive a set of an artist branded Infinite Object 10\" digital frame (11.4” x 7.5”) with the video, a flash drive with 4k MP4 video, and a Verisart certificate of authenticity. </p> [Click to get the full HD version, certificate and physical display](https://verisart.com/works/orkhan-mammadov-c33b2fed-d092-48ec-abd3-0b70807d4ea9).",
