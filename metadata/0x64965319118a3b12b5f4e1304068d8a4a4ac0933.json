    "description": "Unique CelX loop gifs, playing within a 65 x 60 dot grid matrix and rendered in a 1300 x 1200 px format. \nI don’t want to spoil the magic about how I created this interference-wave effect. But let’s say I was kind of deep in a tunnel for a few hours.  Love it’s hypnotic intensity. Now I need some low res LED curtain to bring this to life with a physical presence. Let’s see when this chance is popping up.\nIt’s basically inspired by my love for low-fi light equipment and how honest this feels. ",
