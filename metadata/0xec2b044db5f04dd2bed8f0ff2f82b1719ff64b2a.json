    "description": "To celebrate the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™, Visa has taken five iconic moves from five legendary players and transformed them into works of art, minted into a collection of NFTs to benefit Street Child United.\n\nJared Borgetti’s stunning header goal gave Mexico the early lead against Italy at the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea Japan™, the last match of the group stage. Although Italy would equalise later, the goal meant that Mexico finished top of Group G and advanced to the Round of 16.\n\nSee [terms & conditions](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-fifa-nft-terms-of-use.pdf)",
