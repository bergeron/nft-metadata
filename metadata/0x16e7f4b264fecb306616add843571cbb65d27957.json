    "name": "First Mechanical British Royal",
    "description": "The year 2041 nearly saw the end of the British Monarchy. \nBetween toxoplasmosis from the Queen’s many surviving corgis, dozens of arrests from the multi-level marketing scandal, and the unspeakable disaster at the annual Family picnic, the Royals were racing to the bottom of the line of succession. Thankfully, in marrying his retrofitted litter robot (Litt-R.3X+) on his deathbed, weird old Uncle Oscar saved the British Crown. \nTo be sure, there were some who took issue with a run-of-the-mill, Korean-made litter robot as the figurehead of the commonwealth. And others suggested that her unlikely rise to power was some kind of Machiavellian coup. But in time, the litter robot would win over even her greatest detractors with her self-deprecating sense of humour, and her unabashed love of the TV series Outlander.",
