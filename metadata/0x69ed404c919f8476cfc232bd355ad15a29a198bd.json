    "description": "When the pandemic hit in 2020 the scope of music changed.\n\nMany artists and creatives didn't know how much it would impact us beyond not being able to do shows but it really forced us to be inside and reflect. This alone can kill creativity because many of us thrive off of the outside experiences in life.\n\nHowever, I saw it as an opportunity to push myself to hone my skills. Not just as a writer and rapper but also as a visionary. I took upon myself to start a freewrite series called \"The Takes\" where every track had a beat switch and every title had a number next to it that was significant in meaning (I love numbers and codes that have hidden meanings).\n\nThis mint is also special because it was the last track I recorded before I evolved into my current gold bearded state (haha).\n\nThe Gold Fang Society Comms are now active and this mint free mint will get you access to the guild and Telegram chat where I'll be sharing new music and content early, hosting Zooms to connect with my collectors and more.\n\nhttps://guild.xyz/gold-fang-society-comms\n\nTake 99 prod. by Southpaw Swade & Chop",
