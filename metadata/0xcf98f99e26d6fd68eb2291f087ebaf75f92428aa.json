Because, after all, the life goes on no matter what.\n\nWe struggle for the better future of my daughters who suffer the ICP paralysis. We try our best to help them. Together we express the soul and heart of 9-year-old twins.\n\nI would like to show that my children are the same as other kids: the girls express joy, they laugh, study, learn and create something beautiful and new as well as the others.\n\nThis picture contains a lot of love, kindness and faith in the better future.\n\n\nOil Pastels\n18,5 BM\n15000x10770 px\n",
