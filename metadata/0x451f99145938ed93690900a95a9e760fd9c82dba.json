    "description": "My father was an alcoholic.\nHe died because of his addiction.\n\nBefore this, our family \"died\" because of his addiction.\nI was just a kid. I loved my father. He and my mother were my lights.\nHe was a smart, brave, admired man, by us, by all.\n\nOne day, the light in my father began to darken. It got worse, day by day, month by month.\nHe fought for us.\nBut the addiction was stronger than him.\n\nMy father became a ghost, a man to be feared, even dangerous.\n\nDespite this, he was never left alone.\nWe continued to take care of him, in every possible way, year after year.\nWith tears and prayers, and medical and psychological help, we battled with his addiction.\n\nI hoped, again and again, that his bright light will come back into our lives.\nIt never did.\n\nI loved him, until the day he died.\n\nMy mother is my Superhero.\nMy father is my Saint.",
