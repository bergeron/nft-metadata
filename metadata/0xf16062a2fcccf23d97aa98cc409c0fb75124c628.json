    "description": "One shall know when to put out the candle before it’s too late. \n\nA lesson I’ve been trying to teach myself for a while as I’ve been through many challenging instances where I often fail to handle my anger correctly.\n\nI’ve been observing how easy it is for us to get angry.\nMostly with people we love the most, over situations and often times is a projection of our stress that we may be going through. Sometimes a means of venting and the other times out of our expectations not being met. \n\nBut we shall remind ourselves of how we aren’t alone in this. How we all are trying our best and dealing with life some or the other way and making an effort in our own capacity.\n\nRemind us of how our gestures are the key to grow a healthy relationship. Remembering how the play of words can leave a huge impact upon our loved ones. One shall use it wisely and be patient enough to see both sides. \n\nBecause at the end of the day, we don’t want to let go of our loved ones over challenges that come and go! ",
