    "description": "Obinna : From the Igbo word meaning \"Father's heart\"\n\nBecoming a father is something words can't describe. The fears, joys, hopes and dreams are like waves flooding his heart.\n\n\"Joy\" they say,\n\"Sprouts from within\"\nNo wonder!\nFor my heart palpitates\nAnd my eyes well up with tears\nMy skin bristles\nAnd my soul jingles\nAt last, a progeny!\nFrom my within!\nA son in my image.\n\nJoy is from the inside\nAnd that is what you are\nA bundle of joy\nA beauty to behold \nFrom my inside \nA fruit of my loins \nMetamorphosed from my seed\nIn-between your mother\nNurtured by her fluids\nKicking her walls\nTill the day you burst forth\nHow I've yearned\nTo hold you fondly\nAnd squeeze you tenderly\nIn my bosom! \n\nAnd now, I can't wait To bring you up\nUnder my loving auspices\nTo love and to cherish\nTo care and to nourish\nTo watch you crawl to toddle\nTo walk you through life's hurdles\nAnd nudge you away from wrong\nAnd to show him to you\nHe, from whom you came to me.\nFor a sublime faith in God\nIs the Elixir of Life.\n\n",
