    "description": "1,000 Ethereum Mayors taking over the Bitcoin blockchain via Ordinals. \n\nMint cost covers the gas to deploy your Ordinal. Ordinal minting will start in a few weeks. You will burn your Ethereum NFT and then we mint your ordinal.\n\nThis novel ordinal system allows Ethereum users to trade their Mayordinal NFT on Ethereum and can choose when they want to burn to mint their Bitcoin NFT.\n\nEach Mayordinal is a 1/1 pixel art created by an AI artist using Mid Journey. Holders of Mayordinal get to choose their 1/1 art in the discord during the Ordinal deployment process.\n\nPlease Note: Deploying to Ordinal is a slow process and time-to-mint depends on demand of Mayordinal members. FCFS. \n\nThis is a fun community project created by community members of Nifty Portal. There is no intended roadmap or future utility other than creating the Mayordinals community and deploying the NFTs as Bitcoin Ordinals when members request a burn-for-Ordinal.\n\nWe think this is an awesome way for a community of Ethereum NFT traders to explore Bitcoin Ordinals.",
