    "description": "Razorbladed Dividends is an attitude fueled, liberating anthem with nods to the duos past in bass music and hip-hop. Although it’s not confirmed it can be assumed the song is geared towards corruption in the industry and the suppression of artists, as the song was written shortly after Grabbitz was released from a record deal. “Now that I’m free!!!” is whaled over the chaotic and bass-heavy chorus, with the title lending itself to money that doesn’t come without blood.
