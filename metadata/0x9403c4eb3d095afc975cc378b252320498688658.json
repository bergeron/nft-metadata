    "description": "The majestic Turda Gorge peaks ⛰, the perfect view ✨\n\nTurda Gorge formed over 150 million years as a result of the surface-forming activity of Hașdate River, a small tributary of Arieș River, in the Jurassic limestones of Trascău Mountains.\n\nLegend and reality intimately linked, Turda Gorge takes your breath away with its majesty and richness. It covers an area of 170 hectares, has a length of almost two kilometres and nearly 350 meters difference in altitude.",
