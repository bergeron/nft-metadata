    "description": "This two-faced portrait was and is my signature.\nThe beginning of a long way of exploring the dual nature. And it so happened that I started with Anakin and his transition to the dark side. It must be admitted that in distant 2015.\nI was also looking for myself, and I had absolutely no plans to start drawing portraits.I searched and made mistakes, burned about my expectations and ambitions. And when it seems I finally gave up. Something on that June evening pushed me to the laptop screen. And this portrait appeared, literally out of nothing, in 15 minutes. I woke up the next day when I accidentally opened my Instagram, which exploded.",
