    "description": "This piece depicts the brown baddie Chitraka, proudly wearing her cheetah saree and culture in the depths of the sea. Unknown to her, she has an angel watching over her shoulder, but the tides swirling in her mind don't allow her to see her guardian.\n\nThe English word \"cheetah\" is from the Hindi chita, which likely stems from Sanskrit chitraka (leopard), based on the root chitras, meaning \"distinctively marked, many-coloured\".\n\n\n\n",
