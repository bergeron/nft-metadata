    "name": "San Juan Watchtower",
    "description": "Oil on Canvas with enhanced movement\n30% will go to missions\n\nThis tower which projects off the walls of the military fort, El Morro, was initially built in 1587 to protect San Juan from foreign attacks. Sentry towers such as this one encircles the fort. Today the sentry towers of El Morro offer ocean views to tourists, not soldier. I had the most glorious views of the ocean enjoying the beautiful stonework of the tower.\n\nRevelations 5:13 And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang: Blessing and honor and glory and power belong to the one sitting on the throne and to the Lamb forever and ever.\n\nYou call me out upon the waters\nThe great unknown where feet may fail\nAnd there I find You in the mystery\nIn oceans deep my faith will stand\n\nAnd I will call upon Your Name\nAnd keep my eyes above the waves\nWhen oceans rise\nMy soul will rest in Your embrace\nFor I am Yours and You are mine\n\nCopyright: Bonnie Brooks\nArtwork: brooksgallery.com",
