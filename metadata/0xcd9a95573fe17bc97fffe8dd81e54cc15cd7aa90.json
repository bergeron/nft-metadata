    "name": "Steam",
    "description": "Steam is the first image in my Classic series. Never before seen in the public eye. It was taken during times of freedom and unforeseen adventure when we roamed the globe without friction or fail. Just returned from 3 months in LA, here our London home for 6 weeks en route to Paris to stay. Lea expressed herself in paintings sprawled across the living room floor, creativity was raw, I kept my Pentax loaded watching beauty unfold, and processed these moments behind the kitchen-darkroom door.  Washing away the oil paint, her thoughts vaporized within. Steam.\n\nShot in London, UK. August 2019. \n\nEdition 1/1.\n\nScanned 35mm B&W Negative Film. 4667 x 7000 pixel, 15.4mb JPEG. Processed and scanned by the artist, to the highest standard, unedited.\n\nThe first collector receives a signed print or copy of my hardcover photo book.\n\n[More Information](https://jcseelenmeyer.com/pages/nfts/classics)",
