    "description": "(W:1459.84px  H:2063.62px)\n\nThe motifs and letters found in architecture are fused to create a new order of typography. The Soviet modernist period began in 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev ( First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) adopted the resolution 'On the elimination of excess'. It survived until the collapse of the USSR in 1992 Soviet modernist architecture is steadily disappearing with the dismantling of the Soviet Union. Aside from politics, I think it should be recorded as a symbol of an era. while this poster is a visual experiment, it also aims to record the culture of an era.",
