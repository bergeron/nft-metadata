    "description": "trial and error is the bread and butter of my practice; it is through this process that most of my ideas are discovered. i wanted to build a camera system that would invite joyful engagement - 'cabbbage cam' is a result of that.\n\n\n@mathMakesArt said it reminded them of a cabbage cross section, so that's where the name comes from :)\n\nfile resolution: 1080x1920px\nfile size: 5mb\nsoftware: touchdesigner\nyear: 2023"
