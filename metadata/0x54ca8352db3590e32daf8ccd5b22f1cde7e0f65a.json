    "description": "The character that reclines into chaos and seeks a moment of rest, reminds us of the constancy in which our bodies are asleep, but our streams of thoughts never give themselves a second's rest.\nFighting against it sometimes becomes almost impossible.\n\nSorriso and logbook merge their research, seeking a singular image, seeking a new organization to their thoughts and understandings as a form of shelter and welcome.",
