Everything is within reach, but I understand that going through this is the only way forward. I hold an amethyst close to my heart, hoping it will heal me. And it did. It's the bit of hope that was needed//\n\n\nRetake your power/  \nAgainst all forces that try to take your attention/  \nIntelligence has become purely intellectual/  \nEscape the compulsive behavior/  \nEscape the algorithms/  \nFind out what you are doing/  \nDevelop the psychological strength/  \nYou might think that's impossible/  \nBut it's not impossible/  \nBecause people live through catastrophe/",
