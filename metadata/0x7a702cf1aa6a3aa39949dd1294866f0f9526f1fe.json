    "description": "start of the singularity in my mind was formed in 2018 as a visual story, for the first time in my mind. After the start of this process, the ability to analyze and see the network connection between some concepts in my mind, intensified and after 4 years from the start of this, I was able to implement those perceptions and thoughts into the form of contents and images.\nIt was all started with closing my eyes . In a beautiful plain on the planet of my mind, in the middle of October 2018, I layed on top of a mountain And my mind was immersed in the luminous world of the sun.\nfinally after a few minutes I opened my eyes and the first image was the sun shining like a bright yellow key in the sky.\nYou can read the description of this painting and the beginning of this path in the link of the article that I put below\n\nhttps://medium.com/@paniz.seifi71/similarities-in-my-mind-b921e982b82d",
