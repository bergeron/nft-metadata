    "description": "No matter where I live, California will always be home. It’s the place that shaped me and where I learned about the world. If I had never moved to California, life would be very different. I wouldn’t be married to my wife, I wouldn’t have a daughter and I likely would have never picked up a camera.\n\nIt’s strange to consider, but life is made up of little moments and choices that shape our entire story. Any deviation from these moments, big or small, can have a drastic impact on the outcome. From the day that I was born, my life was preparing me for the moment that I would get in my car and drive west to California. I had wished for it, had dreamt about it, and ultimately fate delivered.\n\nThis pier is the same pier featured in the first piece I ever minted on the blockchain. As I come up on my 1 year anniversary and begin my move back to California after 2 years away, it feels symbolic to be coming home.",
