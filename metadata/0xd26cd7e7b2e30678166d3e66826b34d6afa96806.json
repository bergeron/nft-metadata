    "description": "The heart; the most vital organ of the body and a symbolic gesture of love. \n\nWalking the dunes of White Sands National Park for the first time, I was immediately struck by this scene as the shapes in the sand mimicked a heart. Nature being my happy place often feels just as vital to my existence as the beating heart in my chest. \n\nThis image is a perfect way to express not only my love of nature but how essential it is in my life. \n\nIn life, gestures of love can improve someone’s mood and quality of life exponentially. With this and every image I make, I seek to spread more love in this world….\n\n……with all my heart.",
