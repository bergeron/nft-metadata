    "name": "Prosecco Cat",
    "description": "Vacation in Saint–Tropez, 2022. The place where the great impressionists like Matisse, Cross and Van Rysselberghe created their masterpieces. Musee del’Annonciade where some of the masterpieces are exhibited. Expectation – get a lot of inspiration, paint day and night, and create a pointillist chef-d’œuvre. Reality – hanging by the bar at the beach making occasional drawings with an unsteady hand after a couple of proseccos. Just like this cat.",
