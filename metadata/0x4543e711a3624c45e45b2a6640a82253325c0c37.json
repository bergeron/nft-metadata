    "description": "I have created this animated artwork a day before Valentine's day on Sunday 13th February 2022 as I felt it was the purest expression of love and admiration. This piece was inspired by my partner. El, as I will call her, is a survivor of domestic violence. El went from struggling to put food on the table to writing a book on the subject, earning 2 diplomas (both which helped her understand better the human condition) and later earning a Masters degree in entrepreneurship - mostly all while raising 2 kids on her own. The base art was created using Ai GAN software to generate a fiery nebula in space. The image was then mirrored to achieve what now looks like a Phoenix. The animation intent is to make the Phoenix look as if it's flying with such force it is bending time and space. Quite fitting for a strong lady such as you El. Let it be known that I love you and admire your strength. I am sorry for not spending more time with you. You are the Phoenix. I am glad I am part of the space.",
