    "description": "Sometimes the opportunities, love and other good things we crave for the most is right in our hands staring at us in the face, but we fail to realize them due to distractions that presented itself as the real things. We allow emotions, greed, impatience, lust, pride, ego, lies and fear to overwhelm us, that we become totally blind to seeing the right things. Only if we could see clearly what is right before us, then our journey through life will be less challenging.\n\nEcclesiastes 8:6 GNB  \nThere is a right time and a right way to do everything, but we know so little!\n\nProverbs 14 vs 12 New International Version  \n\"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death.\"",
