    "description": "Growing up, my parents told me not to go to the southern beach near our village. \nIt is said that when visiting the beach, the surroundings turn foggy and you cannot find your way out.\nYou will hear singing in the distance just when you start to panic.\nIn the fog, the old Ghost Ship will start to appear, and you can hear the crew singing sea shanties.\nThis is a recruiting beach for the Captain. When you see the fog, it is already too late, and you will be joining the Ghost Ship crew. ",
