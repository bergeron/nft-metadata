    "description": "In the 21st century the Annunciation has changed radically. Archangel Gabriel announces the arrival of Apps by bringing in his backpack, formerly wings, the new Holy Spirit: the mobile phone.  \nThe process has been optimized and adapted to modern times: it is no longer necessary for the divine hands to make the shipment, but rather the archangel, in addition to giving the news, acts as a delivery man.",
