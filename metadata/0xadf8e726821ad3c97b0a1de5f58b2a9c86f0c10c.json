    "description": "It is often hard to ignore the negative thoughts and doubts that circulate in our heads. We get so caught up in the fear of things and forget about the excitement that exists on the same path. DON’T LOOK DOWN can hopefully serve as a reminder that those negative thoughts are just like clouds passing by - they will eventually clear.\n\nI wrote this song from the heart, hoping it would give you the strength to keep going and encourage you to keep your head up. \nOne of the lyrics from the song goes ‘stars will shine on, after they burn out’ - the noise in your life and the hard days don’t diminish who you are, or the shine that you have.",
