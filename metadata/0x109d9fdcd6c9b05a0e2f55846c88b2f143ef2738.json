    "description": "God Blessed Joseph and Marius with Jesus.\nThey raised Jesus to   preach love and inclusivity, accepting all judgment. They showed that love is love.\nJesus continued this message throughout his teachings, welcoming all people and challenging the rigid gender roles and social hierarchies of his time. He taught that love and compassion were the most powerful forces in the universe, and that we should strive to see the divine in all people, regardless of their race, gender, or identity.\nJoseph and Marius supported Jesus in his mission, proud to see him become a leader and teacher who inspired people of all backgrounds and identities. Their story continues to inspire us today as we work towards a more inclusive and accepting society, where all people are celebrated for who they are and the unique gifts they bring to the world",
