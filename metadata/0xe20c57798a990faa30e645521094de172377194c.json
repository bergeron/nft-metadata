    "description": "I love cats and have always wanted a way to share their beauty with the world. Imaginary Cats allows me to share these marvelous creatures with all of you wonderful frens. \n\nImaginary Cats are spread far and wide across an endless universe. They vary in color, shape, and size, but you will never run into 2 that look the same.  The art styles will be variable for each cat. \n\nA world filled with cats is a better world for all. \nIf you adopt an imaginary cat, you are free to use that particular cat's art however you wish, as long as you own it. \nIC will share rights with all owners.",
