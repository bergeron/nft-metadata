    "description": "How about if you had a picture of the „Mona Lisa“ when it was not yet finished? That's exactly what I offer here. A photo of the 1.5 meter high and 4 meter wide drawing colored pencil on paper, with the title \"Der Magier\". The photo is from 21-05-21 when I was still at work. The analog drawing is now finished and for sale. Check it out on instagram.",
