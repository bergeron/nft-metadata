    "description": "Made in His Image\n\nIn this collection, I'm re-imagining the Fall of Man.  \nThis particular edition depicts my version of what Adam and Eve would look like in the 21st century. \nAdam looks up to this planet (kingdom) which is his source of life [Bright light] and the woman seems unaware of the 'invasion'. The apocalyptic background sets the stage for the environment in which the fallen man finds himself.\n\nMan must help manifest this 'foreign' kingdom on Earth in efforts to restore order and redeem mankind. However, they are still trapped in this new fallen state of being.\n\nLove. Reconciliation. Redemption. Renewal",
