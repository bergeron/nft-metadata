    "description": "Every art project dares to claim to create something new, never seen before.\n\nA precious Faberge Egg – a year of intense skillful labor, a neon tag – a blink of an eye swing of hand. One is considered to be a masterpiece, while the other – just a vandalism. Yet both can leave a deep impression, both – means of single cause: an artist’s self-affirmation effort.\n\nThis project portrays an image of a “point” where two art directions collide, where basically eternal and academic competes with something much more time-sensitive. Yet our piece is digital only, which renders such competition absurd and ephemeral.  \n\nThe Egg is the first piece in an ongoing series The Unstable Hierarchy of Art.\n",
