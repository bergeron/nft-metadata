    "description": "I started doing extreme home makeover's almost 15 years ago. I've been scratching the itch to get into NFTs, so I decided to do an extreme NFT makeover on Checks with this homage to Jason Voorhees and the Friday the 13th franchise. Being the host of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, I always felt like I wore a mask when the show was being filmed... a facade... smiling all the time, being fake AF and over enthusiastic, when deep down I was a cold mfer. I really resonate with Jason Vorhees. ",
