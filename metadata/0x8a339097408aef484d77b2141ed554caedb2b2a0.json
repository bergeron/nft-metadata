    "description": "We are seeing a 1984´s distopian world where humans are living a Matrix life, where it is difficult to separate real life from virtual one. Where are we living? Is real life a reflection  of our virtual one? \nIn a disciplined society, the authoritarian government uses propaganda to maintain unity and the illusion of prosperity in an exploited world.\n\n\nEach composition is made up of 2D and 3D parts joined in a videogame graphic engine that allows us to combine and animate the different parts. As a result we obtain animations that move the elements of the composition very slightly, creating the sensation that they are living paintings that open a window to a new virtual world.\n\n\n**Leyre Pérez Velasco** known in the artistic scene as Leyvel is a multidisciplinary artist specialized in plastic arts, mura- lism and digital composition.
