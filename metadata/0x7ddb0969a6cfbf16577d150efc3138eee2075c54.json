    "description": "Coombe Hill is located in Aylesbury, UK.\n\nCoombe Hill at 852 feet above sea level, is the highest viewpoint in a range of hills called the Chilterns.  The 106 acres of the hill once belonged to the Chequers Estate, but was handed to the National Trust in 1918 by Lord and Lady Lee of Fareham.\n\nThe view from here is spectacular as you look out over the Aylesbury Vale.  On a good day, it's possible to see all the way to the Cotswolds. \n\nI feel calm and relaxed, whilst looking at this image of the sun setting. The lighting and colors in the sky really add, to what is, a breathtaking view.  \n\n\nYEAR: 2014 || DIMENSIONS: 3000*1688px\nEDITION: NFT 1/1\nPHOTOGRAPH COPYRIGHT Â© 2014 BY DEAN BROWN\n",
