    "name": "The Red Wheel of Pripyat",
    "description": "The Pripyat amusement park, located in the city centre, was to be opened on May 1, 1986, to accompany May Day celebrations. However, that grand opening day would never come due to the accident that happened only 4 days prior.\n\nThe rusty, yellow painted ferris wheel has become a symbol of the Chernobyl disaster, especially when seen with its juxtaposition to the looming reactor sarcophagus in the background.\n\nThe amusement park is a key part of the official day tours, as a result the illegal 'stalker' groups such as mine could only visit at night. \n\nThis is one of the most photographed sites in the Zone, so we experimented with different lights and a mask to try and shoot something unique.",
