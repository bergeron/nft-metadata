    "description": "'Gone To Bed' pays tribute to XCOPY's Don't Panic. \n\nWe see a recently deserted living room. Moon light shines trough the window. A projection flickers across the wall.\n\nAs we move to the centre of the room, the frantic series of images reveals to be XCOPY's Don't Panic.\n\nThe occupants of this home must have taken advice from this piece and went to bed, instead of stressing about volatility, market, investments and the like.",
