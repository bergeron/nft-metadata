    "description": "“They had no idea who they were up against! We have destroyed more russian weapons and military equipment than some armies in Europe currently posses. But this is not enough. It could only be stopped by force of arms. It must be done now. Ukraine needs weapons supplies. Arm Ukraine now to defend freedom. We need anything to repel Russian forces and stop their war crimes. Freedom must be armed better than tyranny. Western countries have everything to make it happen. \nARM UKRAINE NOW to defend freedom.” - Volodymyr Zelensky\n____________\n\n10 seconds, 30 fps, therefore 300 different pieces - photos and arts.\n\n[Music](https://soundcloud.com/qaqarotto/arm-ukraine)",
