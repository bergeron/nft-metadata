    "name": "Tördon of Duraban",
    "description": "Forged in the foggy heights of the Fallweather Fjords by master blacksmith Grün (b. 2212 KA – d.2284  KA). Tördon means “thunder” in Droban, the native tongue of Reinboldt. The use of maces began in the kingdom age of man when Reinboldt and Rygaard were part of the Granvalden Kingdom. Today, you can find this weapon for sale in some other lands but only the suits of the House of Rygaard wield this formidable weapon. The first unique iteration of the Tördon after Rygaard separated from Granvalden. It is named Duraban, after the region Rygaard inhabited for two generations before venturing south. The area is located where the River of Glass forks above the Cliffs of Feldune.",
