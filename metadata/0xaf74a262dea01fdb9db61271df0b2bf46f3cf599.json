    "description": "I created TREBUCHET to tell - and write - my story from here going forward. Earlier in my music career I had the opportunity to sign to a record label, and I did. I seized what was (at the time) the best option I had to take music seriously (and convince my family that it could be taken seriously…). Signing that deal opened so many doors, and taught me so much about who I was, who I wanted to be, but most importantly who I was not. As time went by I wandered further and further away from why I started creating in the first place, eventually arriving at an unrecognizable version of myself. \n\nI spent much of the pandemic questioning who I was (as a human and as an artist), what I was creating, and whether or not it was worth continuing. But through time and sustained chipping away I started to remember and re-recognize the kid who first started creating - the one who rushed to open Ableton in any spare free time and express himself honestly and openly - before all the expectations and extra cooks came into the kitchen. This song is my most honest return to that, and I think sets the tone for all of my music that will follow.\n\nI provide this context so that you might better understand TREBUCHET as a song and metaphor. I made this record exactly as I wanted to - with its weird, yet super personal sonic choices, somewhat nebulous lyrics, and a key change at the end (among other things) - because for so long I wasn’t free to create in the way that I know I’m supposed to: following only my own ideas, experience and intuition. The song feels right at home with some of the records I’m most proud of from my past, and combines my newly rediscovered creative drive with my last few years of production and songwriting experience for something I’m finally proud of once again. \n\nI hope you love it as much as I do.",
