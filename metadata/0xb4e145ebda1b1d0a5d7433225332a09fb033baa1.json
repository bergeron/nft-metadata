    "description": "The Infomorph \n\nA darker side to the brighter future\n\nAn infomorph is a digital representation or model of an individual or entity's consciousness or personality, often created by uploading a biological brain into a computer. It may also refer to a self-aware artificial intelligence or a virtual being that exists entirely in the digital realm. In science fiction, some futurist and transhumanist theories, infomorphs are often portrayed as a potential form of life or as a means of achieving digital immortality.\n\n1-10",
