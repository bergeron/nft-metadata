It's when time makes every fleeting second feel special as you know that it will never come back again. \nThe clock at the foreground is a reminder that love is special as long as time is present to add value to it.\n\nDimension: 1080 x 1080\nFormat: MP4\nUtility: 1 Desktop Wallpaper (1920 x 1080)",
