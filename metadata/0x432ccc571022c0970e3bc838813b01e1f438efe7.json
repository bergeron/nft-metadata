    "description": "Bad Seed is an image sequence of 233 individually painted frames and tells a story about the creation and end of the earth. The hyperactive scary sound adds to the hopeless feeling of the earth that keeps spinning while the creatures on it keep making a mess of it. The idea of a Bad Seed, how one bad seed can create a catastrophically moment in time. To me personally it’s also a way to fight with the inner demons of loneliness, like having no control of the world – first with Covid-19 for 2 years, now the war going on and the endless stream of images and videos that shows the horrors we can live in. Anyway I can ramble on. The end of a Game Over is always to start of something new, so it's also part of a series I like to call World 3.1 – a series of works on the reboot of joy after all! \n\nMusic: Power Music Factory (no copyright/royalty free) \n",
