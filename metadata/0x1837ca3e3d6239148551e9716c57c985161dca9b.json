    "description": "SHORT SEASON by Claudia Hart is the NFT of her artwork, THE SEASONS. THE SEASONS portrays a room in which a slowly evolving sculptural figure gradually transforms. In this animated loop, a variety of visual, temporal, and conceptual cycles are offset and overlaid so that their movement is obscured. All is in flux, but time seems to stand still, as in life.\n\nIn THE SEASONS, a seated woman in a pose of erotic abandon cycles clockwise on a rotating pedestal. As she cycles, she decomposes, a vine of roses surrounding her, blooming and then fading away. The room also revolves, though counterclockwise, while the animation camera pans back and forth. These movements function in counterpoint, appearing only on the edge of perception. The sound for the piece is crumpling paper. The color scheme is white on white.\n\nTHE SEASONS is part of the exhibition A BEATING HEART. FEMALE PIONEERS OF DIGITAL ART presented by EXPANDED.ART on view 17 May to 4 June in Berlin.\n\nVerisart Certified: https://verisart.com/works/9a24e2cd-de6b-4e53-8ff7-163389e3bb58",
