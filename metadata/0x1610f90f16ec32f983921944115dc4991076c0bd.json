    "description": "Inspired from the unknown artist who carved snake figure to man's head 12.000 years ago in Nevali Ã‡ori. The snake is generally associated with the world of the dead in almost all faiths. The snake features chthonian property in majority of the mythologies as its poison can be lethal and as the snake molts its skin. That is, the snake represents the death as well as immortality.",
