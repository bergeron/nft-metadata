    "description": "I felt the best way to start my Foundation journey was with this piece. A culmination of years perfecting my photography journey. \n\nI was faced with 105ยบ monsoon weather, but sent it anyways on a hike to the Superstition Mountains. No sooner than finishing the shots I came for, lightning started to strike all around me. \n\nAs the clouds moved in, it started getting dark and ominous. The landscape filled with jumping cholla & barrel cacti looked like something out of the apocalypse. \n\nBeing able to catch the lightning and have the whole frame in focus felt like winning the lottery and the whole gamble of shooting that day paid off.",
