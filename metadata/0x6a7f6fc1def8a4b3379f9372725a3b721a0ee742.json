    "description": "There is a special feeling one gets when you make direct eye contact with a wild gorilla. They have a way of opening a door to your soul. On a steep volcano inside Volcanos National Park, Rwanda, this juvenile and I made a connection. It might have been my big camera lens it was fascinated with or maybe my playful relaxed body language. No matter where I moved its eyes were fixated on me. I had no other choice but to bring those watchful eyes to the world. Give my audience a window into what it feels like to have one of the worlds most beautiful primates look deep inside you. ",
