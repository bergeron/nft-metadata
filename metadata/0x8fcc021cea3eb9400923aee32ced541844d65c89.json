    "description": "This is a meme making light of how whitelist was handled for A Kid Called Beast. Mismanaging whitelist can turn into a beast for NFT projects trying to launch, and turned into an absolute disaster. This is a free mint that ends whenever AKCB gets their wl situation figured out. It's something to have in your wallet and enjoy this weird moment in history together!",
