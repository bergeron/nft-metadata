    "description": "Pixel Prizes, handcrafted in Cinema 4D, are the rewards for completing the Zero to Mint crash course on NFTs (zerotomint.xyz).\nZero to Mint exists to welcome you to this web3 revolution, so that you are equip with the knowledge to confidently experiment in this highly opportunistic space.\nIn the experience, we guide you through NFT basics such as terminology and project types, hold your hand through opening a digital wallet, and ultimately minting a Pixel Prize. Made with :heart: by DS.\nWhy pixels? At DS, the double pixel is our identity. We created 470 different Pixel Prizes in homage to our headquarters at 470 James St. in New Haven, CT. Each prize has its own traits (some rarer than others) and will earn its owner unique rewards based on rarity.\nPixel Prizes & Zero to Mint were conceptualized and designed by Alex Hornak and Kellie Vibes, Senior Brand Experience Designers at Digital Surgeons.",
