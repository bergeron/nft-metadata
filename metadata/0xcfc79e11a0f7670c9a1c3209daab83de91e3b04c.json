    "description": "The Consul v3.0, which is coded from the Ancient Rome to the present day, at the point where the copy of everything is the copy, where the artificial and the real cannot be distinguished, is a representation of the 'secrets' known by the society administrators, the effort to be revealed in the consul and the search for the truth.\n\nThe Rare Pepe phenomenon, which is created by the society to use it as a 'meme' in the digital world and is also a property of the society, represents. This phenomenon tries to solve by questioning the 'secret' of the managers at the top of the community, which is divided into different groups by means of status.\n\nYou look at Consul and look for the 'secret'. You won't find it because you're not looking carefully. You don't want to know the 'secret', you want to be deceived.\n\n",
