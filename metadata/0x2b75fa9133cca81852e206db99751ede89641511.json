    "name": "The joy of freedom",
    "description": "Freedom is a strange word. In Tehran, it is attributed to a tower, which is also called Azadi in Persian. Azadi Tower, as a symbol of the capital of modern Iran, using the structure of postmodern architecture has a feminine image and is reminiscent of the mother's arms and in a more general point of view of the motherland.\nIn my dreams, freedom of women in my country just like the liberated charm of Marilyn Monroe as a symbol of sensuality and female beauty encompasses the whole world; a world in which peace, passion, love and freedom can be found; as I tried to demonstrate in the art work above.",
