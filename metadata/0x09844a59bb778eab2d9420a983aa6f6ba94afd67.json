    "description": "Down on his luck and against all odds Sauvage manages to defeat one of the toughest opponents of his life. \n\n\" Sauvage stood with a solace, having had exhausted all his jutsus to no avail he could only laugh at his imminent demise. The purple giant he faced started charging purple lighting for what would be a final shot... Sauvage took a deep breathe, which seemed to last for eternity. His life flashed and for a brief moment allowed what had just happened to him, to process... He has just lost his best friend..\"\n\nThey say it was the reflection, the introspection into his life, finally tending to his emotional hygiene is what awakened it. A flash of bright light temporarily blinding the beast, caused him to lose focus on collecting energy. He watched as a blue/ purplish energy began to spill forth from Sauvage. \n\nWhat was this newly awakened power!?\n\nAll proceeds used to fund future seasons of #AHMC -Artist Highlight Mashup Contest- and it's participating artist.",
