    "description": "Envy is the desire for something that does not belong to you. The extreme manifestation of this passion is a direct desire for evil to a more successful (according to the envious) neighbor. It can lead to extremely dangerous conditions. But the worst thing is that such a sin is self-destructive: the first to commit it was Dennitsa, the highest of the Angels. Envy of God pushed him to daring opposition to the Creator. But, having fallen away from the source of life, the former Angel lost his perfection, becoming the devil.",
