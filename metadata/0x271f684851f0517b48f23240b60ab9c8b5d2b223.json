    "description": "Introducing the stunning winning artwork by artist Chamakou from the Galverse Art Matsuri 2022! This exciting event brought together hundreds of talented artists to create secondary works of the world and characters of Shinsei Galverse, Japan's first breakout web3 success.\n\n“It was both hard and fun to come up with their personalities, relationships and to create the world of gals from the bust-up illustrations of the original work. I wanted to draw the gals as if they were alive on the screen, so I hope you can feel that!”\n\nJudged by the Web3 community's most respected figures - Betty from Deadfellaz, Clon from Cool Cats, and Naoki Saito from Megami - Team Galverse awarded over 40 artists with thousands of dollars in prizes and NFTs.\n\nProceeds from this mint are shared between Team Galverse and the artist, Chamakou.\n\nCollectors can burn this NFT to redeem it for Open Editions of the Galverse Origin Story mini-documentary episodes.",
