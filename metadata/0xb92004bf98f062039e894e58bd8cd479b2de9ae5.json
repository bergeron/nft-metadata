    "name": "Nulla",
    "description": "Nulla is the first card in the Major Arcana of Tarot: The Fool. This card represents new beginnings and the first step towards growth and spiritual awakening. When drawn in reverse, this card signifies a warning of selfishness and forging on recklessly. \n\n---\n\nTake time to properly understand your place in the world and what you do not know so that you may learn and grow into the being that you deserve to be. \n\n---\n\nAbout the collection: Initiate's Journey serves as a guidebook, a sort of Rosetta Stone, for those looking to take their first steps towards spiritual and emotional peace and enlightenment. The pieces themselves are charged with the lessons that they are meant to teach. Each one will elicit a different reaction before and after the viewer has truly achieved understanding of that lesson.
