    "description": "This is Esquilant Bivvy, a mountain refuge nestled in the breathtaking Aspiring National Park.\n\nI wanted to use colour, texture and composition in this piece to portray the serene beauty of this remote alpine refuge.\n\nThrough all my work I strive to capture not just the physical attributes of the landscape, but also how it makes me feel spiritually and emotionally. I hope this piece transports you to this awe-inspiring location which is so special to me.",
