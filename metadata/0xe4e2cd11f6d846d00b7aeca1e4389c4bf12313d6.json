    "description": "[ICC Cricket Hall of Famer](https://www.icc-cricket.com/hall-of-fame/hall-of-famers) and considered to be one of the all time greats in cricket. [Sachin Tendulkar](https://www.icc-cricket.com/hall-of-fame/hall-of-famers/player/97) has plenty of world records including most runs in Test & ODI, highest number of centuries, and most international test appearances. \n\nThis stump was used during his 169th test appearance when he broke the world record held by Steve Waugh for highest test caps, during a match against Sri Lanka in 2010. Sachin went on to break many more records and played until his 200th cap, when he retired in 2013.  He continues to own the record.\n\n**Signed by Sachin himself.**\n\nThe original item is part of the Ceylon Cricket Museum;  a private collection of cricket memorabilia of a cricket enthusiast. \n\nLearn more at [Ceylon Cricket Museum](https://ceyloncricketmuseum.com) & [Futurelics](https://futurelics.io).",
