    "description": "Mechanika V6 is a generative geometric abstract series written in p5js from the ground up without reference to any other project. The code has been worked through from version 1 to the current version, 6 (V6) There are in total 500 pieces that have been created from this code and no others will be released after.\n\nIn Mechanika, I make use of the new creation of forms & spaces via the dark areas as well as the coded geometric shapes themselves, this adds new and sometimes surprising elements to the initially coded structures.\n\nThe title Mechanika is based on the word 'mechanics', in that I've connected elements to give the frequent appearance of mechanical utility in some abstract world, via wheels and levers/axles, and the angles of interest produced thereof.\n\nThere are 7 different background colors, and each piece is also an individually unique 2000x2000 jpg.",
