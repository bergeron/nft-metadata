    "description": "Some time ago an event happened in my life that I was afraid to share. I was only able to share it with one person and now with my picture I am sharing it with you.\nI had been in a relationship for several years with a guy, I loved him very much and over time we even started to live together. During arguments he often threatened me that he would hit me, but he never did. And then one day he hit me. I will always remember the pain and devastation I felt. Every time I think about it, I shudder.\nIn this picture, I captured my condition. The red bloody orbs reflect the pain, the threads symbolize affection, the white flowers represent the love I was experiencing.\nI realize now that this guy was an abuser, but I didn't at the time.\nI wish everyone never to encounter people like that and run away if they do, because I live with that trauma every fucking day.",
