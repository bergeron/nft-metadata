    "description": "Life in Our Minds: Mother Flock, by art collective Random International, which was founded in 2005 by Hannes Koch and Florian Ortkrass, and Danil Krivoruchko, an award-winning multidisciplinary digital artist and creative director, is a generative interactive work that allows viewers to physically manipulate a flock of thousands of swarming pieces of bird-like origami. The artwork is a continuation of Random International’s exploration of the human tendency to ascribe character, intent and narrative to the complex behaviors of simple moving forms, as well as the subconscious instincts and emotional triggers that cause us to do so.\n\nMother Flock is an edition of 2 unique NFTs. The first edition comprises a minted video of the Mother Flock, as well as fully optimized software and hardware that enables an interactive experience for the collector. This optimization allows the collector to view and interact with the artwork on any screen, in-real-time. A second edition of Mother Flock will be gifted to the Life in Our Minds project DAO.\n\nLife in Our Minds is produced by Pace Verso, the web3 hub of Pace Gallery, and Snark.art’s OG.Art NFT platform.",
