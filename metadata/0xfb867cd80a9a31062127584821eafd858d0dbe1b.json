    "name": "MOON RABBIT",
    "description": "The rabbit was an astronaut from a different world who came to earth with few of his friends to help humanity, by fulfilling their needs, but as the greed of humans increased their needs increased and they kept asking for more and more until the astronauts had nothing left, the greed and selfishness of humans also caused the nature to die, which led to lot of death of animals and humans. As last resort the Moon Rabbit chose to sacrificed himself to save the planet out of his kindness.\n\nYou must be thinking does it have a happy ending, no, it doesn't, humans engraved his symbol on the moon for what he did out of respect but they never learnt from him nor they changed.\n\nGood people will become a symbol for what they did, they will be remembered but the world will always remain in chaos.",
