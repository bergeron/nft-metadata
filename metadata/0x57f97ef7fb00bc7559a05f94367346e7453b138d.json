    "description": "I had a very crazy dream…we were all passengers in a time when people had\nlost part of their faces – only the eyes remained to show joy, sadness, fear, surprise –\nbecause there was a worldwide pandemic that stopped the planet and erased people’s\nfaces, it had erased a lot of whole people too.\nPeople were isolated in their homes dealing with their ghosts…that for the luckiest, but it\nwas just boredom, for the less fortunate, it was hunger.\nIsolated people tend to create things, for good and for bad…\nThey can create entire orchestras from the buildings balconies, with people they’ve never\nseen before.\nAnd they also can create paranoia.\nThe first ones happened more at the beginning, and they came followed by posters with\npositive phrases and colorful drawings.\n\nThe second ones started happening right after people discovered that baking bread would\nnot prevent emotional breakdown..\nThe productivity paranoia rolled over.\nThere was the loneliness paranoia.\nThe paranoia of lifting the carpet rolled over (and see everything you had hidden down\nthere).\nThere was paranoia running through the whole dream…\nThere was a children’s party without guests, It had family reunion by video call, there were\npeople hugging each other through plastic barriers.\nAnd as I am quite creative (my dreams are always surrealism successes), in addition to the\npandemic, there was a humanitarian crisis, political crisis, ethical crisis…it was a swarm of\ncrises!\nAll blended .\nWe were there, trying to stay sane…increasingly scarce.\nAnd it’s not the end…",
