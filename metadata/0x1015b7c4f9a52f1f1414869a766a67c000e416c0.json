    "description": "\nChione, with beauty so bright,  \nHer pride, a curse, blocking the light,  \nTransformed by Artemis' arrows swift,  \nInto a doe, a new life to uplift.\n\n\nHer two sons, Autolycus, Philammon bold,  \nTheir love for their mother, never growing old,  \nVowing to break the curse, and set her free,  \nFrom the transformation, a wild and furious glee.\n\n\nArtemis, with her bow and her might,  \nChallenged the boys, to a fierce fight,  \nBut their bravery and love, could not be deterred,  \nThey stood their ground, their hearts pure, their love pure.\n\n\nImpressed by their courage and selfless heart,  \nArtemis released Chione, a fresh start,  \nHer beauty restored, her pride now humbled,  \nA lesson learned, of love and life, so simple.\n\n\nSo Chione lived, with her sons by her side,  \nTheir bond unbreakable, love and pride collide,  \nA tale of transformation, of beauty and grace,  \nA story of love, that will forever remain in place.",
