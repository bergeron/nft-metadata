    "description": "Words kill, words give life. They are either poison or fruit; you choose, as none are immune to the tongue‚Äôs effects.\n\nAll too often, we use our words frivolously; they cut and pierce as easily as any weapon. The tongue may not draw physical blood but the pain is felt as real as any wound, each scar on our soul with a story to tell.\n\nRegardless of social standing, skin colour, job title, nationality, gender, orientation, we all bleed the same colour.\n\nEach soul comes with its own story. Some burdened by tragedy, some glowing with inspiration.  Yet all are precious, and beautiful, having a been awarded a place in this world.\n\nThis NFT is accompanied by the IRL EXYGEN piece.",
