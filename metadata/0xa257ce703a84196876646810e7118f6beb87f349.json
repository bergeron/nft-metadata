    "description": "This 3072*3072 pixel image refers to Friedrich Nietzsche's abyss aphorism. A man, lost in pessimistic thoughts about life, standing in front of a large tree with a crimson sky\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche's famous line says: \"He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into you.\" Beyond Good and Evil, Aphorism 146./ published 1886\n\nNote: The repetition of the line \"And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you\" emphasizes the profound impact that confronting darkness or engaging with negative forces can have on one's own being. The subsequent line about fighting with monsters warns against the potential transformation or corruption that can occur when facing and battling with evil or destructive forces.",
