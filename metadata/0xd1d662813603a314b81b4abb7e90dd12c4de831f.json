    "description": "Do NFTs dream of Electric sheep?\n\nUBIQ is a unique collection of ‘digital performance paintings’. \n\nUp to now performance art demanded the viewer to engage & to be physically present. Now, we have this very different online digital environment where we don't have direct engagement; the viewer is probably seeing the work from a mobile or a gallery in the Metaverse. \n\nUBIQ was created with the consideration of how performance art can transform in the digital art space to something that may be a derivative of what we knew performance to be. It explores ways to create New Forms of performance as ‘digital performance paintings’ in the NFT space.\n\nEach work is a 1/1\nand all are variations of a fictional character ‘ubiq’ inspired by novels of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. The costume and set are of equal importance as the body and the movement. \n\n\nCreated By @dancevatar \n\nmusic @elektroniki\nperformance @_gavgaav\ncamera @dancevatar & @anartist\nsalt lake, 34.600834, 32.955002\n\n2022 ",
