    "description": "The world has been entirely razed by the sun's growing size. Humans and most organic form of life has wiped off. \nA wandering civilization of cyberoids stumbled upon earth and decided to live onto the earth till sun engulfs it completely which will still take a few hundred centuries. \n\ncyberoid X2★ finds a 'lotus flower' with its petals intact in an ancient underground pond.\na town hall was organised to understand and study what it was. some mumbled that it was an ancient relic , some labelled it as alien weapon. No one had never seen any organic life. Even though a lotus is harmless, they were fearful. \n\nMay be it was the fear of unknown. The fear that they might face failure to save their civilization or the fear is something from within us that has nothing to do with reality.\n\ndescription)\n\nArtist :https://lynkfire.com/uditkumar?\nPhotographer : https://linktr.ee/CryptogodNaman?\n\nThe mentioned NFT is minted as part of Cryptogod's World 2.0 : Fusion of Photography x NFT.
