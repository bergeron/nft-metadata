    "description": "hello, i’m alara. i’m a singer-songwriter and visual artist from new jersey. \n\nmusic has always been a part of my life. i began writing songs when i was 11 and taught myself guitar all throughout high school. i've always felt like i didn't belong and creating music was the best way for me to express that emotion. to express all emotions. it was a world i created where i could escape. growing up as a child of immigrant parents, i never saw being a musician as a viable career choice until one and a half years into medical school when i decided that i had to try. i spent almost every night for a year playing open mics in new york city, building a community of artists who made me feel like i wasn't alone for the first time. that year made me realize making music wasn't a choice, it's something i had to do.\n\nfast forward to november of last year. i was just learning about NFTs for the first time and spending every free moment immersing myself in the world of web3. the idea that artists could finally break the confines of the traditional music industry drew me in almost immediately. i'd like my experiences here to convince the 15-year old indian girl struggling to play barre chords in her east coast bedroom that she can be a musician if she wants to be. \n\ntaking inspiration from artists like thom yorke and damien rice, my sound has evolved as i learn more about who i am. i wrote “demons” as a way to tell myself that it's alright to be vulnerable. this song is as much for me as it is for someone very close to me. it’s about finding solace in the idea that everyone is going through something. your demons may not look like mine, but we shouldn’t be afraid to admit that they exist. we shouldn't be afraid to open up. \n\ni hope it helps you in some way.\n\nproduced by alara and steven lafashia\ncover art by @nikhilchitre",
