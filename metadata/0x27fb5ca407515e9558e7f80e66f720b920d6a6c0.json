    "name": "Sleep Paralysis",
    "description": "35% of the world's population has experienced sleep paralysis at least once.\n\nMany people see creepy, smoke-like creatures screaming or whispering in their ears. People hear sounds similar to wind.\n\nSleep paralysis is caused by (jinns) genies - intelligent beings from a parallel world, created from pure fire. Sometimes they can come into our world, where we can see them between stages of wakefulness and sleep.\n\nI have tried to recreate sleep paralysis in 3D as much close to that I have experienced and strugled for years by myself.\n\nHave you experienced sleep paralysis?\n\nif you haven't experienced that spooky moment, then now you can find out how it happens.\n\nP.S.: Turn the sound on",
