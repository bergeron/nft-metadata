    "description": "Flower – Seemingly weak like petals, our excuse is that we’re just humans but we only have one chance at life so why are we limiting ourselves to society’s norms? We all have a vision of the kind of life we want and for the world we want to live in. So why not build the future you’d like to see? Anyway, a flower does not compete with other flowers around them, it just blooms. \n\nPower – Get rid of your past traits, open your mind, let your imagination run free, explore unexplored paths and learn new skills. Things may not be easy at all so surround yourself with people that give you strength. You know you’re stronger than bad times so always do whatever it takes to keep evolving!\n\nArt and Animation by Ellaces. \nRoyalty-Free Music by Bensound.com.\n",
