    "description": "On an early December evening, in the midst of a cold rainy day, a stroll through the ever-buzzing Shinjuku brings forward a full experience of sights, sounds, smells, and taste. From the bright and colourful neon lights, to the smell of delicious broths boiling in the many Izakayas, to the symphony of chattering crowds, clinking beer glasses, and the welcoming greetings by various shopkeepers, the cold and wet concrete metropolis just melts into a warm and cozy scene.\n\nShinjuku - 1 - Yataien Crossing is the first of a three part limited edition Shinjuku series as part of the the Tokyo Trotting collection. Each of the three photographs will be an edition of 10.",
