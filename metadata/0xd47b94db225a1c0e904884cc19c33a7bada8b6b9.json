    "description": "I will never get tired of saying, that Iâ€™m in love with the Community. This collaboration with Ksu is an another proof of this. \n\nI met Ksu almost as soon as I got into the community. She was insanely responsive, but what I liked mostly - she was not afraid to share her opinion and position, even when she did not agree with the opinion of the majority. She is very energetic and even a bit funny. I was surprised that our IRL meeting few weeks ago did not change my idea of her at all, because she seemed exactly the same as I imagined. And I'm really glad that now I can show her to you with my own eyes, through the lens and my feelings.",
