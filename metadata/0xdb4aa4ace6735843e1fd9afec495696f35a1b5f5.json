    "description": "Technique: oil on canvas + needlework\n With a feminist approach, this collection has been performed with the influence of the illustrations of the Qajar Shahnameh book. Violence, masculinity and power can be seen in most of the scenes of these images, and there are fewer women in it. Therefore, by using these images and combining them with my own portrait, I show the dominance of patriarchal culture both socially and in terms of aesthetic approaches that can be seen in Iranian culture to this day. The image of a woman behind a veil is displayed from what we know as masculinity. These self-portraits express not a personal symbol but a public symbol of what the Iranian woman is facing.",
