    "description": "\"Angelus\" is Jean-Fran√ßois Millet's most famous work, painted between 1857 and 1859. This oil painting depicts a scene of two farmers praying as they work in the field, accompanied by the ringing of a bell.\n\nThe painting depicts a landscape with two figures standing in the middle of the bushes in the field, showing the setting sun and infrared hues in the sky. Behind the praying figures, in the far corners of the field, several houses and trees can be seen.\n\n\"Angelus\" is an example of Millet's realistic style and also reflects his respect for agricultural workers. The painting has a particularly important place in French painting and is exhibited in many museums.",
