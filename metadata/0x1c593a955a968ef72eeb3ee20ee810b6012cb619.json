    "description": "‘OCTOPUSSY’ is a creative response to the rising power of the feminine that I feel within myself and the world around me. At this time in history I sense the blooming of a geography of thought that embraces the intuitive, aesthetic and natural forces around and within us.  \nThe Octopus is a creature I associate with the sacred feminine - powerful, mysterious, sensual and intelligent. Working with this potent symbol, and a fusion of the written word with AI and digital painting tools, I've created artworks that celebrate the power of the divine feminine and the ecosystems that foster this internal force within us all.",
