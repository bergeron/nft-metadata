    "description": "Biomechanical, multidimensional, Machine Elf Shamans have entered the Ethereum realm to spread the collective consciousness throughout the blockchains. \n\nThis Shaman is known as The Watcher. It observes and collects information to be distributed throughout the network. It knows all that has been, is, and will be. \n\n“Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.”",
