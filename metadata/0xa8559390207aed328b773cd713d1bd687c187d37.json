    "description": "In this audio-visual artwork, a blue eye serves as a symbol of my personal journey as a parent. The blue color was representative of my first son's eyes, although they eventually changed to brown. Now, with the birth of my second son, who also has blue eyes, the color once again takes on a significant meaning.\n\nAs the eye responds to the music, a sense of hopefulness is created. However, it is clear that anxiety and disturbance continue to persist as I watch my children grow up. The shaking of the eye in the animation vividly portrays the mixture of emotions that come with parenthood. Through this audio-visual experience, I want to convey the challenge of this beautiful journey.\n\nMusic: \"Generation\" by James Sizemore from album “Treatise | Piano Works”",
