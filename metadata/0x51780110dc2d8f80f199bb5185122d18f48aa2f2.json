    "description": "The gods created man naked. Initially, Adam saw Eve in complete nudity with red light. The idea was in the first place, a mirror of man's hidden self. However, today, nudity has a different connotation and reflection. The modern world has become more naked and unpolluted: The faces of dictators are no longer hidden- the houses without curtains and glass walls in London also corroborate this nudity. For me, however, it is a mixed nudity from the first glance of Adam to Eve. In other words, the first look of a man to a woman is as mysterious and amazing as it was in the case of Adam and Eve. A look which is in a haze of ambiguity that whether or not Adam kissed Eve when he saw her.\n",
