    "description": "\"I’m not a monster. I’m just ahead of the curve.\" is a 'Phunk Rock Posters' originally minted by ogkenobi on October 2nd, 2021.\n\nThe original NFT has been burned by sending it to the CryptoPhunks smart contract at transaction hash:  \n0xc6c761a433015fab338826f2db9e4afd3b96d6dc30b77a9d81941246e05f2031\n\n\nPhunk Rock Posters is a collection of phunk-inspired punk rock posters created by ogkenobi in response to LarvaLabs DMCA takedown request which led to OpenSea de-listing the CryptoPhunks for the 3rd and final time.\n\nThese posters often reference CARGO.BUILD which, at the time, was the only marketplace you could trade Phunks.",
