It takes courage to stand up for what we believe in. It takes courage to say no to things that no longer serve us.\n\nIt seems like there are a lot of things trying to pull us away from our path.\n\nBut whatever happens, you do have the power to change the direction of your destiny.\n\nThe definition of courage is: the ability to do something that frightens one; bravery\n\nThat means to do something, despite the fear!\n\nWhenever you feel afraid of something, remember \"The Courageous Heart\".\n\nCourage is in you - you just have to use it, and it will grow stronger.\n\nLots of Love\nOliver",
