    "description": "The **‚ÄúPeace‚Äù** collection by Ukrainian artist **Stepan Ryabchenko** reminds us of the most important thing in such unsettling times ‚Äì Love. Love is a state in which calmness, grace and peace reign. A state in which there is no place for malice, hatred or war. Love is the state of the Creator, the state of true happiness and inspiration. Love endures everything and encompasses everything. It brings hope. Love will never end. **Peace and Love to all** üíì",
