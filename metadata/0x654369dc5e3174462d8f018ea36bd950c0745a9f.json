    "description": "❄️ Title.\n\nKamisato Ayaka. Tranquility.\n\n\n❄️ Description.\n\nThe writing reads: \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" — this refers to Kamisato Ayaka's title (Japanese: 白鷺の姫君 Shirasagi no Himegimi), which means \"White Heron Princess\".\n\nClosely related to the Japanese cultural identity, the koi fish symbolize luck, prosperity, good fortune, strength, and perseverance.\n\n\n❄️ No watermark.\n\nThe digital non-watermarked version is not available elsewhere.\n\n\n❄️ Complimentary wall scroll.\n\nThe highest bidder can receive, if they agree to it, the largest size full length print of this piece, similar to a wall scroll. The dimensions of the print are as such: 35\" x 11.69\" (About 3 feet long). The watermark I typically put on my art will be removed. I will contact the highest bidder via their communication mode of choice to arrange shipment. No payment is required for the print - it is complimentary.\n\nFor more details of my prints, you may visit my online art store here: https://meowsmarket.bigcartel.com/",
