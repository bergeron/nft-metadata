    "description": "The first piece in my SuperRare Genesis series entitled: \"InfraVision\". The idea of this project is to showcase various scenes captured with both a regular camera and a modified infrared camera. Being able to capture this hidden spectrum that is invisible to the naked eye is something truly incredible as a photographer.\n\nAs someone who has been obsessed with colorful photography and creating vibrant images for over 7 years, infrared photography has opened up an entirely new and colorful look for locations that I have visited an endless amount of times. This location in particular is very near and dear to my heart. I have been visiting this incredible waterfall ever since I was a small child but I never fully grasped and appreciated the beauty of this place until I started to develop a passion for photography as a teenager. Since then, I 've come back to this place every month for the past few years. Every time I visit, I am calmed by the beauty that surrounds me. I am reminded of the soothing effect that nature has on the mind. We truly are so blessed to live on this beautiful planet.",
