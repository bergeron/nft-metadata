    "description": "Zine 1 of 6 in the Hue Year's Resolution Zine Collection. These diaristic explorations tell a chronological story through typographic, prose-filled digital collage art.\n\nBeginning with past abuse & trauma and ending in my healing process, these zines take you through 6 years of my life (2012–2017), one hue at a time. \n\n2022 marks one decade from the start of these events that led me to dark days, but never destroyed me. I am here today, celebrating my survival with the minting of this collection.\n\n------PDF OF FULL ZINE & SELF-PRINT INSTRUCTIONS INCLUDED: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQvXvbik4bsofbzBb8TVYESjU6WtTCX2BnZELBq6FDoiP\n\n------BLIND: ZINE 1, RED\n\nLife Period: 2012–2013, when I found myself intoxicated with infatuation for what I saw as a broken soul in need of healing.⁣\n\nThis zine is a rosy depiction of the dangers that come with ignorance, empathy, and blind love.⁣\n\nIn many ways, the Red Zine is glowy, hazy, and blurred — a reflection of myself during the time in which it takes place. I was accepting and practicing life like it was an instrument I wanted to master. And to master anything, one must hit bad notes. Fall. Fail. There is no growth without vulnerability, and I intended to grow tenfold.\n\nThis zine is a reflection on just how little I controlled my own life at the time. There were times I loved it, times I felt guilty, times I fed into the darker side of me, but mostly I was on clouds, and that lifestyle didn't require much thinking. I sort of liked that. Not having to think about anything was dangerously attractive. ⁣\n\nThe things that happened during this time weren't my fault, but they weren't really anyone's fault. Things just are. They just happen. You get to learn from them later. In the moment, all you can do is experience. ⁣",
