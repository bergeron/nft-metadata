    "description": "The Sense of an Ending\nThere are days in our lives when nothing seems normal. We can feel cold winds. We can feel that life is not colorful. Ocean waves crush our souls and we can do nothing except being crushed. You feel there isn't any god, there isn't anyone that you can depend on. There is only you, and you have no control. Events that Are Unforgettable. There are some colors, Red, blue, yellow, but after all these colors, the only color that remains is Black. In front of the sea, eyes upon endless blue. Wind plays with your hair. Colors most of them Red, Comes out from the left side of your body. Summer winds howl through your veins and finally, you are Free, full of colors.",
