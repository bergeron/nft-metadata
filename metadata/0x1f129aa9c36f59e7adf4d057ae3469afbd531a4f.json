    "description": "Mint 1 or more of my #GlitchArt Genesis for FREE ! Up to 5 per Wallet !\n\nThis free claim will help me to know if I start my #GlitchArt experience or not. \n\nI discovered the #GlitchArt months ago but thought that it will not match my own style.. I knew nothing about it, that's why lately I started my searches and followed a bunch of #glitchart artists.. Found that this style is completely different from an artist to another\n\nI started to try different types of #GlitchArt from @XCOPYART (the master) style to @emX81Art (my friend) style and ended by doing a combination between my own style and glitch. Create a cartoon character and glitch it..\n\nI didn't wanted to create something similar to what is done by lot of artists.. didn't wanted to change completely my style to another.. It will maybe take me more time to draw a full character then glitch it, but it worth the time spent on it !\n\nSo now it's up to my community and #GlitchArt community (hope I reach enough of them) to decide if my style is enough good to put all my energy and time on it. It's difficult to me to switch styles as my current community is not fully aware by the #glitchArt potential..\n\nYou can Claim up to 5 of \"I START HERE\" pieces per wallet. More mint I will have more confident I will be for the future.  \nThis piece will have some utilities in the long term as you will need it for some future events.",
