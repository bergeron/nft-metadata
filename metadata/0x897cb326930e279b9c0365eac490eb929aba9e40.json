    "description": "30 second animation with audio\n\nThis NFT is part of a collection I tiled Closed Eyes. In this series of artwork I'm exploring the human anatomy beyond our physical form. For each new piece I start from a 3D scanning of my own body, This becomes my \"blank canvas\" where I sketch on the dreams and desires I have already had or the ones I want to have... with my eyes closed. \n\nfor more info about me and my art please visit my website. www.johannesnielsen.com\n",
