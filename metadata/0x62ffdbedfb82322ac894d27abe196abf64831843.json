    "description": "Soso, [22.02.2022 14:32]\nHere you see the moon as a female face, which can also be viewed as two faces. One side of the moon is black, symbolizing bad times, and the other side is white, symbolizing good times. Both faces are sleeping and dreaming the same dream of many stars which are symbols of wishes and hopes in the sky. With this artwork I want to show that there are always bad times and good times, but one must always remain hopeful",
