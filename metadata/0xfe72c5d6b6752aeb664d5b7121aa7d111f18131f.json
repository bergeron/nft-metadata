    "description": "“I always feel misunderstood by people. But for some reason the voices in my head tell me that they trust me and I am a good person. I don’t know why, every time I look up, it feels like the clouds are falling on my head. My sky is full of mirrors. Broken mirrors, where I can never see my full image. Some parts are always missing. I am very scared of my imagination. It keeps betraying me. I don’t like feeling numb, but people understand me only when my eyes are made of glass. Do you think I would have friends if I was like everyone else? Haha. I just heard him say you’re a good person too. He doesn’t really like anyone. Strange. Sometimes I feel like I am pregnant with a warrior that will change the world. But I am not a female. Is that how pregnant women feel when there’s a baby? Do you like reading? Sorry. I’m just always too curious and it keeps me alive.  \nI read lots of books. Dostoevsky wrote about me. I’m just an idiot; a curious one tho.”\n\n\nAn1, 2023",
