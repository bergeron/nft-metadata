    "description": "\"Borderworks\" emerged from an earlier series series entitled [\"Walk with Me, A Sojourn\"] (https://gregshawzw.com/digital-works-2/walk-with-me/), a series of works created as a diary during chemotherapy treatment. As part of an ongoing investigation into [borders/border theory] (https://gregshawzw.com/2021/04/26/horns-and-a-circle/), re-worked versions of the series were hosted in a web3 domain located behind national firewalls and not easily accessed by viewers in my geographical space. \n\nThe potential for greater freedom of speech beyond the borders of my physical territory was (and is) of significant interest. However, the account was closed by the host, and the minted NFTs lost in the process. Those works cemented in the blockchain are now located beyond a border to which there is no access. These works are a third version, conceptually removed from the original source. Whilst visual elements suggest literal and physical borders, it is the conceptual aspects that remain paramount. \n",
