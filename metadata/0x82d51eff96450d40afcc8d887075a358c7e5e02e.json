    "description": "Ryu has arrived from Tokyo to Paris. \nThe City of Love is on fire. \nIs Ryu using her power to throw fireballs in the streets or spraying love hearts on the walls?\n\nA creation inspired by my love to the place where I grew up. Full of contrasts, full of clich√©s, but forever in my heart.\n\n'Not a graffiti'  collection is named after my old battle cry. You could hear it when me and my friend, as  teenagers,  were escaping neighbors or cops on our bikes after decorating a wall. Today, I guess we would yell 'Not a NFT'...\n\nRyu is a Tokyo Punk by Ali Sabet.",
