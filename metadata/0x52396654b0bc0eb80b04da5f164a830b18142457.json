    "description": "This work reminds me of a fairy tale. In it, one constantly puts on different masks depending on one's mood. In life, too, we put on masks to hide from the world. We hope that our pain and sadness will not be seen behind these masks. Sometimes it is a mask of joy, we want people not to see our sadness. We don't want the people around us to be sad. These days, it is rare that anyone is without a mask and frank with us. We resent those who are honest with us, but few accept the truth as when we were children, with a smile and peace in their hearts. This work reminds me that sometimes we need to take off our masks and go out into the world with a smile and a pure and kind heart, just like when we were children.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",
