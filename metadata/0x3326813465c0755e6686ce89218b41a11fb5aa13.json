    "description": "Rumi inspired  to be hopeful and optimistic about the soulful urges. In one of his amazing poems he states:\n”Do you know what you are?\nYou are a manuscript oƒ a divine letter. You are a mirror reflecting a noble face. This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself;\neverything that you want,\nyou are already that..”\nRumi inspired her to better understand the world within herself in order to know how to use the power of choice. By knowing the powers within her own self she had everything needed to create, explore, and reflect on the world. This house is the reflection of our poet.",
