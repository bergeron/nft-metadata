    "description": "We as parents, sons, daughters, friends & lovers of those with neurodiverse minds, learn the nuances, and provide needed support. We learn new perspectives, adjust our wants & needs. Sometimes grieving for what canâ€™t be, stemming from societal influence or our own predetermined beliefs. But we learn to love in new ways. Hearts expand, minds open to new ways of seeing the world:  a world where all minds can discover & learn from others' gifts & limitations to help each other live, love, thrive.",
