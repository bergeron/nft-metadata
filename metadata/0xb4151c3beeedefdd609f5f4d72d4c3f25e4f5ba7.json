    "description": "The veil between love and loss, the dichotomy of life and death. Nothing is permanent but memories can keep feelings alive throughout time, for better or for worse. These works are meant to explore the divergent emotions of losing a loved one. It’s easy to get lost in (sadness) but it’s better to celebrate the (joy) of what was.",
