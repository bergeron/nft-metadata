    "description": "The NFT artists in this space gave me my inspiration.\n\nI never imagined being an artist. I have painted a lot of portraits as a hobby, but it was never my goal to sell them. They all hang on the walls of my mothers house. \n\nThe last painting I made was in 2013. For the past 9 years I set my brushes aside and allowed them to gather dust. I even gave away all of my paint. \n \nThe pandemic took a lot from me, as it did for billions around the world. I didn’t just lose earthly belongings, I lost a piece of myself. I changed in one way for the better because I am stronger now, but I also changed in a way that I personally despised.\nI am setting myself “free” from the pandemic and the heartache and change that came with it. I now see peace, contentment and freedom. I can’t help but smile. \n\nI am Free.",
