    "description": "The goal of this project is to create an animal loving eco-system that can spread awareness of animal abandonment issues and help struggling animal shelters with their daily needs without the risk of starvation due to lack of donations. By adopting a puppy in this collection, you have directly helped the livelihoods of animals currently living in these shelters. A portion of sales will be directly donated to the shelter, as well as royalties donated to them on an ongoing bases in the future.",
