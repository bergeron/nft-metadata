Cozomo masterfully executes the Romanian Deathlock with a left-footed lunge jumping off the ropes\n\n2. While Greg is dazed, Cozomo ponders his next move. This scene takes us back to October 19th 2009 to the famous \"WWE. Raw: Snoop Dogg speart Chavo Guerrero\" \n\n3. Cozomo pulled off flawlessly the figure-four leg lock against of Greg\n\nFun fact: Cozomo's ally Kdean was also there.. But let's be frank, it is not that Cozomo needed his help. Kdean just wanted to watch the fight from the front row...aaaand we totally get that!!\n\nI was at this match too and (as always) was drawing NFTs for the new collection of 4,200 hand drawn elbows of the defeated Greg. I literally had to be in two places at the same time to capture all the details. The collection is called Elbow JPG and is available on BROKENSEA\n",
