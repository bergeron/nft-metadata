    "name": "The Cyclicity",
    "description": "Cyclicity, despite its apparent stability and predictability, can be deceptive. Every cycle, no matter how indestructible it turns out to be, is vulnerable to destruction. The inexorable passage of time, combined with external forces and unforeseen events, can destroy even the most stable cycles - this serves as a reminder that in fact there is nothing permanent, and change is an integral part of existence.\n\nIn the face of this transitory nature, life has a remarkable ability to show strength and resilience, often surpassing the grip of death. I found the strength of life in the face of adversity, in the midst of decline. It is an inner feeling that encourages organisms to struggle with the inevitability of death, to seek means for survival, adaptation and prosperity. \n\nThis reminds me that even when faced with the inevitability of death, life can triumph and create new beginnings, proving its superiority over the end.",
