    "description": "I write this from a wooden hut in the jungle of a lesser known island in the Indian Ocean. \n\nLiving in the blinks between timezones, I’ve documented the last 10 years of my life through 1000+ microsongs – threads of transient nostalgia captured on tape.\n\nNow trading nature immersion for urban hustle, I’m knitting together the last decade via release. “Old Friends New Cities” is a collaboration with photography platform Analogue People, and 10 photographers (5 men and 5 women), from around the world.\n\nCurating a collection of 10 photos paired with the music of Old Friends New Cities – Analogue People has juxtaposed the realities of nomadic city life over a longing familiar to the metropolitan among us – a return home; to nature and to our roots. \n\nPersonally – this is about closing the loop. With this release I say goodbye to Old Friends New Cities – and hello to all of you.\n\n-dessauer\n",
