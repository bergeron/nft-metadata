    "description": "The other side of me is a collection representing the other side of us.  The one we judge, shame, hide and abuse.  It is the one we focus on in the mirror. The one who is getting old, getting fat.  The one that never measures up and will never be good enough.  \n\nIt is a reminder that the face we put on is our face too.  The confident,  amazing soul we present to the world is just as much the real us.  \n\nWhat would happen if we were kinder to the other side?\n\nWould they disappear?\n\n",
