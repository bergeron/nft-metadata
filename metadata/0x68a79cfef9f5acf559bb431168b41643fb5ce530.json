The secret of its production was kept hidden by the Chinese for centuries, and it wasn't until 1708 that precious porcelain could be produced in Europe. Its triumph began with the Rococo era and it remains a precious commodity to this day. Painter Andreas Amrhein has artistically reworked delicate porcelain art and made its figures the main characters of his paintings. He is a virtuoso nostalgic border crosser.\n\nThe objects of his painterly desire come from traditional porcelain manufacturers like Meissen, Hutschenreuther and Rosenthal. Andreas Amrhein manages to create a stage \"for the big performance\" for figures like the diabolical Mephisto against lovingly staged backdrops. He uses painterly perfectly placed highlights to give them a radiant porcelain surface. This brings out a wonderful plasticity and lightness in them.\n\nNothing appears preserved and static; instead, he characterizes moments of astonishing mobility in his paintings. The figures, which he portrays with great attention to detail, such as the elegant horsewoman riding sidesaddle, effortlessly controls her rearing horse. Their particular materiality is astonishing and sets them apart from the rather delicately painted background in a realistic way.  \nAbove all, the animal figures are fascinatingly expressive despite their delicate silhouette. A delicate crane standing on endlessly thin legs towers impressively in front of a picturesque landscape scene.\n\nAmrhein amazes our viewing habits, because instead of being dusty and nostalgic, porcelain appears graceful and full of elegance in his paintings. He cleverly enlarges the actual miniature format of the figures into objects of considerable size. The proud stag, as an imposing presence embedded in a natural panorama, appears to be alive due to his lively pose against the delicately applied Alpine scenery.\n\nHis series is a humorous homage to the tradition of porcelain collecting, which has made the painter himself an expert in the field of porcelain history. Since 2006, he has been intensively involved with the topic, and to this day, the diversity of figures from various manufacturers, be they historical personalities or characteristic mythical creatures, is inexhaustible.\n\nWestphal-Berlin                                                 \nKunst und Projekte  \nwww.westphal-berlin.de, 2008  \n115 x 95 cm \n\nFragile Treasures Perfectly Staged\n\nHistoric porcelain is a coveted collector's item at antique fairs around the world.
