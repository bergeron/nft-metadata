    "description": "The Thinker, originally called The Poet by Auguste Rodin, is a world-famous sculpture that captures the intense concentration and introspection of a solitary figure lost in thought. Made of bronze, the sculpture depicts a man seated on a rock with his chin resting on his hand, deep in contemplation. This is the first ever officially licensed The Thinker NFT as a premium digital artwork in 3D by ElmonX. Holders can view and interact with the NFT in Augmented Reality. Edition: 1 of 550",
