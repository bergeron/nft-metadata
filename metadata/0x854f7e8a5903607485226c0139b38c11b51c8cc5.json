    "description": "There is a place called Toadstool Island, upon which a group of amazing characters work to protect all nature from fearful foes. These are the gonzovationists and their main problem is a guy called Kevinio Rodrigues the extincter. All extinct creatures and those that are endangered live here and are looked after by the gonzovationists. Luckily for the species that live here, Kevinio is truly awful at killing anything. This portrait is believed to have been manipulated to suggest he is good at his pastime of death and destruction. If only the rest of the world had an ability to be incapable of damaging nature.",
