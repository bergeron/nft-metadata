    "description": "What can be darker than the war crimes? \n\nShelling civilian buildings is the manifestation of weakness, primitive and brutal force that believes in its impunity.\n\nSeeing it all the time we get numb to horrors and desensitised to atrocities. Don’t let it become something ordinary.\n\nSupport Ukraine. 80% of the proceeds from this collection will go to Ukraine’s official crypto donations account.",
