    "name": "In the Void",
    "description": "In the Void is a real painting by famous artist 1984. \n\nIn the Void explores the relationship between Jungian archetypes and multimedia experiences. With influences as diverse as Caravaggio and Buckminster Fuller, new synergies are distilled from both mundane and transcendant meanings.\n\nEver since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the human condition. What starts out as yearning soon becomes corrupted into a carnival of temptation, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the inevitability of a new understanding.\n\nAs spatial phenomena become transformed through diligent and critical practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the outposts of our world.",
