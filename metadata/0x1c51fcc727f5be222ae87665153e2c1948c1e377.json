    "description": "Abstract #3 is the first piece in the Abstract Lines collection.\n\nI've been intrigued by abstract art for some time now, however I found myself afraid to create an abstract piece for an equally long time.\n\nAfter visiting Miami for Art Basel, I found myself inspired and wanting to experiment more with my art - which meant it was finally time to try abstract work!\n\nI wanted to call attention to the 3D space of this piece through the use of contrasting shapes, colors, and angles.\n\nIt leaves me feeling retro, happy, Miami vibes - I hope it does the same for you!\n",
