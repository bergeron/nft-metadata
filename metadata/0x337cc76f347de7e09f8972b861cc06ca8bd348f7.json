    "description": "Cabrera’s collections replicate a theme in a variety of presentations, with the bull being the subject of some of his most recent works. Created specifically for The Meatpacking District, El Toro De Oro breaks the mold of Cabrera’s bull series, living independently from the original seven and standing alone as the only sculpture created from bronze and designed for outdoor installation.
