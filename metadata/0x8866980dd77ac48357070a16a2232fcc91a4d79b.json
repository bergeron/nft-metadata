    "description": "Above all, love in essence changes over time, over season but what will remain is the commitment, the effort you put in every single day through the uncomfortable, and selfishness. You simply learn how to love them by letting things be, by releasing your grip, by laying down your arms, by realizing they are their own individual with human needs.\n\nLove someone selflessly without expectation of ownership. It's the bravest thing you can do and that's how it's done in the silence of it all, in the calmness of everyday life, in the magic of unknown. Because in the end love is the best thing we do.",
