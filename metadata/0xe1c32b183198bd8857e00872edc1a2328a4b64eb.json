    "description": "Every day we are kept alive.\nOur hearts beat, our blood circulates, we breathe, and we desperately try to keep ourselves alive, even when we do not intend to. \nWe live in such a miracle.\nThe earth is alive, too.\nIt is because it is alive that typhoons occur, and it rotates on its axis to maintain balance with the planet.\nPerhaps the earth is trying to protect itself in order to protect human beings.\n\nThis world is a world where everything flows in cycles.\nTime moves forward, emotions shift and change, and through circulation, they become clearer.\n\nLoving oneself leads to loving the earth.\nTo love yourself is to love the earth, and to love the earth is to love yourself.\nIt is a wonderful cycle.\n\nThis work expresses that wonderful world.\nWe live together and grow together.\n\nWe will continue to care for the earth and engage in various activities.\nI will engage in activities that are fun and full of happiness for both humans and the earth.\n",
