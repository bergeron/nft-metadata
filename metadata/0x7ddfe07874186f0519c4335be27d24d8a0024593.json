    "description": "\"The Gathering of the Black Renaissance\" is a striking digital image that pays homage to the masterful compositions of Leonardo da Vinci and other artists during the Renaissance time period. \n\nThis piece depicts a large group of African American people during the Renaissance era, gathered around a large pool. The figures in the background are engaged in various activities, such as swimming and relaxing, while in the distance, we can see the grandeur of the buildings of that time. \n\nThis image invites the viewer to imagine the vibrant and dynamic lives of Black people during the Renaissance period and to consider the ways in which representation shapes our understanding of the past and the present.",
