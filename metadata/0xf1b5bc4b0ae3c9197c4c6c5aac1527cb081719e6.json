    "description": "Any photographer in NYC will tell you how coveted an opportunity to shoot from the Chrysler Building is.  While compiling my wish list for my recently published book, \"New York From The Air\", this was the shot that sat unchallenged atop the list.  This image is not only a testament to putting your mind to something and getting it done, but also  the power of community.  Over the years the creative community has become something of a second family, and when I called in a favor...the call was answered.  I was welcomed to shoot twice from the fabled 61st floor of this Art Deco masterpiece, and each time was unique and incredibly special.  It is my extreme pleasure to present this image to you...My NYC Holy Grail image",
