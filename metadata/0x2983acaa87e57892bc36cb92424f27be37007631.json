    "description": "Life in Protosey’s mind  was ridiculous, but funny, and in Life’s mind, Protosey was simply ridiculous. With this attitude, they somehow got along with each other on the outskirts of Perm for fifty-five years.\n\nLife in Protosey’s mind had the form of an unsightly space, the image of which sometimes drowned in the all-consuming veil of cosmic events. At these moments, Protosey felt sick in a Sartre-like way. He could not relate to the visible world in any way. For the stability of perception, he clung with the stumps of his consciousness to some random thing. The last time it was a spoon rusted in sour soup. «This thing out itself,\" he joked to himself. Altogether, things represented a kind of wrinkles of space, between which Protosey tried to hide his flabby body from fate, which in Holy Russia is called Death according to the passport.\n\n[Сontinued here](https://twitter.com/kungurov_den/status/1492417474926718980?s=20&t=n1dDz5YEtx0ghmvho0SVwA)",
