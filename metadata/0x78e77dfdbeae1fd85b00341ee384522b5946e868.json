It is a black and white photograph on a miniature set with the figure surrounded by golf balls. The figure was created by Alberto out of bent wire. It is the epitome of surrealism due to its playful juxtaposition of 3D and 2D. \n\nAbout Alberto Rizzo\n\nAlberto Rizzo was the most important and creative fashion photographer of the Mad Men era – his artful productions lent haute couture from the 1960s and ’70s its glamour. Rizzo’s photos have graced the covers and pages of almost every important fashion magazine, and his works are widely collected from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.",
