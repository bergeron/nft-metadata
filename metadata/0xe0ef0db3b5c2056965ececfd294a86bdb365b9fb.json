    "description": "Helicity is a term in fluid dynamics that references a corkscrew-like motion. It describes the delicate juxtaposition of rotational velocity and momentum, such as that required to form a tornado.\n\nAs a meteorologist, it is one thing to have an understanding of the fascinatingly complex dynamics of our atmosphere.\n\nIt is another thing entirely to witness them with your own eyes.\n\nA textbook cannot show you how furiously the atmosphere churns and roils, nor how rapidly the clouds swirl above you.\n\nIt cannot prepare you for the way the air catches in your lungs as a funnel cloud slowly twists its way toward the surface of the earth.\n\nIt's as if the entire universe is holding its breath..\n\n\nArtist: Jessica Moore\n\nTitle: \"Helicity\"\n\nMedium: Digital Photograph\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense granted to collector: Extended Editorial\n\nExtended Editorial license terms:  \n \nCan be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
