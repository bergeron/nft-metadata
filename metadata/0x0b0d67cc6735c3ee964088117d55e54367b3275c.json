    "description": "SHARI is the culmination of 4 years of work by mera takeru, a pioneer of crypto art in Japan. \"SHARI\" means cooked white rice and remains of Buddha in Japanese. The continually flashing skulls celebrate our repeated \"life and death\" and the permanence of the digital world of repeating \"0 and 1\".  \n\"SHARI SSP.\" is a subspecies of SHARI and has a special meaning with one kanji character drawn on it.  \n\"Haruki\" was created based on the theme of spring, one of the four seasons in Japan.\n\nSHARI  \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/shari-nfts",
