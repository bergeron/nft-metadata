    "description": "Hey, I’m 33 Below and I’m really excited to do my first drop on Sound! I'm a multi-genre producer from New Zealand, currently in the process of relocating to London. I’m super happy to be a part of Parker’s (demotapes) EP, we’ve been working on ‘sedatives’ on and off for a long time so it feels good to get it out!                                      \n\nFrom demotapes:                                     \n\nOver the last year I've been incredibly inspired by a few artists who I've met online. This is the core idea behind my debut EP, \"with friends\". One of those friends is Jack (33 Below) who I first discovered on TikTok and immediately knew I wanted to work with. Early in 2022, I started a simple chord progression and sent it over to Jack, and \"sedatives\" was born. We finished this song over the course of a few months of Zoom sessions. To me, this song feels like longing, it feels hopeful, and it has a tranquility that I feel like I was searching for when we made it. I'm so happy it's out in the world now. \n\n\n",
