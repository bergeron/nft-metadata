    "description": "As I age, time seems to keep going faster. Days and weeks slip by without much notice. How is it spring? How is it 2022? How am I 40? Where did the last few years go, in a haze of pandemic sameness? It's all blurring together, punctuated by those days I do something different, or go somewhere, or make a particularly amazing photograph. I don't want to live like this, the sameness. I want to be free to make art, and play outside, and go on adventures. ",
