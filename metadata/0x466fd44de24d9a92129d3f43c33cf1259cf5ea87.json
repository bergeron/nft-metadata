    "description": "From my \"WHAT I SEE-MIAMI\" collection, this was the piece that started the collection off. Instantly upon moving into my condo downtown, I was inspired to capture all that was around me. Art Basel was the first thing that brought me to Miami. After many years of visiting and wanting to move there one day, I finally did it. A dream made true. This is Documentation of my arrival in Miami and the love that I share for this city.",
