    "description": "The Sneakerheads skins are a free time based reward for holders based on how long they stock. To reach level 1 holders needed to stock their sneakerhead in its box for 30 days. After 30 days you unlock the level 1 skin which is inspired by a Persian carpet and is a reference to our artist Alis culture. The skin is only available for people when they level up and is a way for you to show off what you accomplished on your sneakerhead Journey.",
