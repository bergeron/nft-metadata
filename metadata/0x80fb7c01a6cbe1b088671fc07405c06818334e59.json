    "description": "In Japanese, Samurai, The Historical Warriors are usually referred to as bushi (武士, [bɯ.ɕi]), meaning 'warrior', or buke (武家), meaning 'military family'. I describe the fighting spirit of the samurai with the two elements of the Dragon which mean 'Balance in Strength'. Red Dragon means courage, Green Dragon means Prosperity. The combination of the two will create a Mighty Samurai in defending the Truth. I painted this story with Psychedelic Artstyle and use a mix of bright colors as my Original identity. Combines many colors that have many deep meanings. The various colors of the background are described with many calm colors that also have their own meaning.",
