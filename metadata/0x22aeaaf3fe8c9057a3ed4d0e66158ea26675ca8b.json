    "description": "bb’s first music video :)\n\nBootstrapped this video DIY-style with the help of some amazing collaborators:\n\nKatie - an architectural designer, illustrator, clothes-maker, all-around creative person, and also my partner <3\nEmerson - an illustrator, painter, photographer, videographer, and all-around creative person!\n\nBetween the three of us, we conceptualized, produced, filmed, and edited this video to promote my song Catch Me, the second single off my debut EP “Into Our Hands”. It was shot in both Albany, NY and Los Angeles, CA.\n\nWe learned so much by making this video, and can’t wait to make another! Now that we’ve made the Catch Me video as a sort of proof-of-concept with ZERO budget, we’re looking forward to taking our craft to the next level with a lil more production value! We plan to use the Creator Grant to expand our team, step up our equipment (Catch Me video was shot on an iPhone), and allow us to dream bigger!\n\nYour vote means the world to us, thank you.\n\nMuch love\n\nyadzi",
