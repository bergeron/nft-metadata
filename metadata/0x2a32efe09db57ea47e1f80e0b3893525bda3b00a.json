    "description": "We live in an age where we often conceal our imperfections for the sake of social media curation. \n\nWe constantly experience conflict between the way we desire to be perceived, the way the world makes us feel we should be perceived, and, the way our personal experiences control the multiple perceptions we develop of ourselves. \n\nWith the continued rise in popularity of our digital identities, these actions, if neglected can create multi-faceted issues with regard to our mental health and social interactions. \n\nNormalizing support and therapy is one way to enhance and promote the conversation. Five percent of proceeds from this artwork go to mind.org.uk whose mission is to provide advice, access and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem.",
