    "description": "The streets are ablaze with hatred and fear,\nA cycle of chaos that will never veer.\n\nThe air is thick with the smell of ire,\nAs people succumb to radical desires.\n\nIt's a cycle of violence and despair,\nSeeking solace in an atmosphere so rare.\n\nThe innocent victims pay the ultimate price,\nFor those who seek out hate and strife.\n\nBut even in this cloud of darkness,\nA light can still appear in starkness.",
