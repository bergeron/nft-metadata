    "description": "We all have been there... The year of 2020, stuck home, dreaming of being somewhere else. Fortunately, there is imagination! \n\nEliska Podzimkova |29| is a young artist from Prague, Czech Republic. She is an endlessly creative multimedia artist whose unique wit, strong sense of design, and immense technical skill have all contributed to her international reputation as a pioneering animator, illustrator, and digital artist. Her unusual technique of blending live action photography and video with humorous yet emotionally poignant handdrawn animation is universally appealing across genres and borders alike. Whether applying her art to award-winning short films, music videos, collaborative photography projects, or marketing campaigns for such as clients as Jamie Oliver, Vogue Magazine, New York Film Academy and many others.",
