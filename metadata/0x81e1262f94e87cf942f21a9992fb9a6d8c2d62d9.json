    "description": "When I initially released Versions of Me, it was truly an experience of stepping into a season of reflection and actively affirming what I deserve and the beautiful things to come. \n\nThis LIVE flip is a labor of love and came together so beautifully. It's just one example of the progress of my journey, and reaffirms that I'm on the right path. \n\nLive instrumentation was done by an extremely talented array of musicians:\n\nArty J. -Piano, Drums, Synth Bass and Live Arrangement\nCory Kenji- Bass\nPatrick Rector-Guitar\n\nOriginal Production/Mix/Master by Joshua \"Tipz\" Richardson\nVocal Arrangement/Lyrics by Jazzi Richardson",
