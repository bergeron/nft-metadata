    "description": "Take Heart is a collection of drawings by artist, educator, designer, and inventor André Sala. After suffering a stroke and receiving heart surgery overseas, his medical claims were denied by Medicare. To raise money for hospital bills and ongoing care as he regains the function of his left side, he’s releasing this series of artwork originally produced in the 1970s.",
