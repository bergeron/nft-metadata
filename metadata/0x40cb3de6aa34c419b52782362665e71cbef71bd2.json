    "description": "Radames \"Juni\" Figueroa X Juan \"JUFE\" Fern√°ndez\n\nNever Ending Tropical Fountains is a series of ephemeral sculptures that the artist Radames Juni Figueroa places in his openings and invites spectators to celebration and leisure. Each fountain is created with a tower of fruit, a water pump, natural juices and alcohol. On this occasion Juni and Jufe have come together to collaborate and create a collection of digital sources based on the originals and through the digital medium to seek to immortalize something ephemeral.\n\n2007-2021",
