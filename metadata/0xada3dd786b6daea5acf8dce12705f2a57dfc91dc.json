    "description": "1/1 NFT \n\nWith three weeks of exploration and discovery in Iceland, this was the image that took the most planning, dedication, and luck of the whole trip.\n\nEstrahorn is often dwarfed by his big brother Vestrahorn just down the road. This lesser photographed mountain is just down the road and commands a beautiful view of Icelands southeastern coastline.\n\nPhoto by Levi Harrell, Of All Nations Media",
