    "description": "This is my SuperRare Genesis piece. As everyone knows i am a artist that loves multiple styles of photography. That being said Urban and Street photography is my passion. Capturing moments is what inspires me and keeps moving forward as a artist. This photo is one of those pieces. Its also a piece that has never been shared with world until now. \n\n        It's a story of a man who lived his whole life in this neighborhood watching things change through gentrification and reflecting on a changing world coming out of a global pandemic and the civil rights movement of 2020-2021. It's these little moments and people you meet along the way that mean everything.",
