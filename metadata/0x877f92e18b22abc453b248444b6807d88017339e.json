    "description": "At the tail end of the mansion, behind a net curtain, sits a woman, a fearless lady. Not a nymph nor a flirtatious mistress, she is a childless mother. for thousands of years, Faerie has been doing penmanship practice on myriad buckskins with feather and ink: “I am the mother, mother of all mothers, mother of Gaea, and I have given birth to a giant snake, that devours all creation, dawn to dusk, allure, and charm in disguise, deceives all there is” She has got two attires, which come in two colors; dark that forges the night and varicolored that fashions the day. In the morning, she wears a veil, mounts an uncolored horse, and rides out of her mansion to put mankind on trial with a well-polished-looking glass.\n\n\"You who are besotted by worldly possess. contemplate upon what eyes cannot see. this guide, this flawless mirror, helps you to achieve self-Examination.
