    "description": "Dancing Fields is a collection of hand-selected 42 code-generated, post-processed digital art. The working process primarily consists of the analogy of DJ sampling, remixing, filtering, and sequencing. The final images are usually surprising: some are fuzzy, some are crystalline, some are afloat, some lightness, some darkness, some are harmonious, and some are noisy. It reminds me of the synesthetic feeling of what's like on the dance floor: the colored lights, the groovy movements, and the transient emotions.",
