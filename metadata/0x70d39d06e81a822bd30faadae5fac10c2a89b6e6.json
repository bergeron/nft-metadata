    "description": "I created this self portrait photograph in my tiny Brooklyn bedroom. There are many times in life when nothing seems to be working out, you feel directionless, lost, and uncertain about all aspects. That is where I was when creating this piece. \"When Darkness Enters\" represents the times where we must push through, accept where we are in life, and know that things will come to you when they are ready.
