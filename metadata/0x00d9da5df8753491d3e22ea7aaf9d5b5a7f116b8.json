My Name Is Jeff, a piece of art & meme culture stuck in my head, until now. \n\nJeff is emerging out of the ocean introducing himself as he always does since the dawn of time. The people of the Golden Floating Kingdom became stunned and frightened as the hideous beast kept saying over and over, My Name Is Jeff. \n\nArt Name - My Name Is Jeff\n\nArtist Name - neru.eth",
