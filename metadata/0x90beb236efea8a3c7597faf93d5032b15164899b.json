    "discription": "I have created 3980 individual illusion art within 24 hours ,each of this illusion art images contain 3 different color combinations, and all together the 3980 illusion art images make a great collage of 17850px*17850px which is 318 million pixels , Not a single art among the 3980 illusion art are same in color combination. Colors used in this art are : #000000 (BLACK) #7F7F7F (GREY) #880016 (BURGUNDY) #ED1B24 (ALIZARIN) #FF7F26 (PUMPKIN) #FEF200 (YELLOW) #23B14D (LIME GREEN) #00A3E8 (DEEP SKY BLUE) #3F47CC (FREE SPEECH BLUE) #A349A3 (VIOLET) #B97A57 (CONTESSA) #FFFFFF (WHITE) #C3C3C3(SILVER) #FEAEC9 (CARNATION PINK) #FFC900 (TANGERINE YELLOW) #EFE3AF (PALE GOLDENROD) #B5E5ID (INCH WORM) #9AD9EA(BIZZARD BLUE) #7092BF (SHAKESPEARE) #C7BFE6 (FOG) Each of this illusion art image among the 3980 illusion art image are 512*512 pixels in size. This collection of art work was totally made by myself , there was no bot or algorithm used in this making process , for proof I have uploaded screen records on YOUTUBE platform. I started creating this art on 13th of JUNE 2022, and finished the collage work on 29th of June 2022. It took 17 days to complete the art work . The collage has a central Dimond like illusion image which was the first ever digital art I ever created ,The Dimond image has a image with Black background and circle with scrambled colors within. Along the central image a plus like formation is made to separate the four quadrants each of the quadrants has a group of scrambled collage of illusion art works , In total the plus formation and the four quadrants are bordered by a black border and four consecutive border formation in different sizes of Illusion art work . MY VIEW : The right top quadrant of the art represents the life of a child filled with love , joy and a perfect life . The top left quadrant represents the life of a teenager who has a lot of stress and thoughts, This is the age when the mind is not focused at a particular thing ,its filled with scattered thoughts and emotions. The left down quadrant represents the life of a well settled gentleman who has a family of his own now and a good flow of income ,and there is just a little amount of sadness in their life. The right down quadrant represents the man who has retired and living his last days in loneliness having some good old memories of those golden days he lived, the dark part represents the sadness in his life which are the loss of the loved ones and children getting married and moving on with their life and living alone or being left at old-age homes by his children. The central plus like formation represents the flow of life and the central Dimond with red background represents the soul of the person and the image in the middle of the Dimond with black background and a circle filled with scrambled colors represent the emotions of a human . In total this collage is a representation of a regular human's life.",
