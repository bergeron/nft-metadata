    "description": "[SOUND ON]\n\nThe Tree of Life, also known as the Tree of Knowledge, makes its appearance in mythology and folklore of cultures around the world. It is a symbolic representation of the archetypal realities that underlie all aspects of human and planetary consciousness and existence. \n\nThe Tree of Life is deemed to be the blueprint that was used in the creation of the universe, and has thus always stood for life, renewal and energy. It provides the path one should take in order to find the union between the physical self and the divine self. \n\nThe energy channelled through this sacred symbol has been activated using original audio played on a double flute in 432 htz accompanied by percussive rhythms. Its intention has been supercharged using the healing vibration of crystals. \n",
