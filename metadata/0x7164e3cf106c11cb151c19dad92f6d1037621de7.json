    "description": "This is the original demo version of a song called \"Hunt By the River\" which ultimately became Baby Jane's single, \"Hex\". Jane and her producer, John Flynn, started this as their first experimental \"witch-punk\" style song. During the process of making this track, Jane decided to rewrite a new song over this instrumental with the same female-empowering lyrical sensibilities. \"Hex\" was written and the beat was reworked to fit the new top-line, but \"Hunt By the River\" now remains as a demo version until further progress is made on this track! (Still, it is very special to the artist for it's confessional nature and poetic lyricism exploring important topics such as power dynamics and tw: s/a.)",
