    "description": "GDR's first public animated illustration confronts the ever-presence of death in the human experience. Every instance of beauty, flourish of inspiration and spark of hope is centered on our mortality. While some fear this macabre perspective, it's the rarity and finality of life that imbues our existence with a need to cherish what we have.\n\nEach frame depicts a separate moment in life, with its colors representing the feelings and moods of the moment.\n\nAnimated by GDR in his Manhattan studio.",
