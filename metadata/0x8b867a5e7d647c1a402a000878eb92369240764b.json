    "description": "I Close my eyes, trying to think about nothing, but it's not possible, my mind is a mess. a few steps further, there is a deep swamp. If I go there, nobody sees me again. what great news. come on.do it. the only chance to finish this nightmare. now I can feel it. it's cold. I'm going down. my mom used to call me butterfly, she was a true angel, but her kid is just a wingless butterfly, a worm. an ugly, shy, stupid worm. I can not see anything, I can not hear. somehow it's relaxing. goodbye everybody, see you in hell...oh, no...somebody catches my hand.",
