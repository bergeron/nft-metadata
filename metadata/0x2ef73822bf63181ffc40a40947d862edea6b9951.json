    "description": "Collaboration with MCHL GLDS. \n\nWe reflect on Karel and Josef Čapek's creation of the word \"robot\". It was mentioned for the first time in a 1920 science-fiction play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), but its definition was misinterpreted. The Karel rejected any mechanical matter of a robot, which we can see in the modern cultural interpretations. He defined robot as an artificial human made of a substance like organic matter, through with a different chemical composition. Therefore this robot of present times was created based on the original Čapek's definition.",
