    "description": "Asiatic lion cubs resting on their mother show the strength and support Lioness provides to her little ones. In the early days of the cubs lives revolve around their mother. Lioness protects, cares and nurtures her cubs very tenderly and lovingly. Without her care and protection cubs her vulnerable to attack from predators or male lions of other pride. Hence her role is very crucial. This heartwarming moment was captured in Gir forest when I spotted lion cubs playing around her mother when one of them tried to jump on her mother's back.",
