    "description": "\"The battle of light and wind\" shows a part of the North coast of Iceland, taken at the end of a winter storm in February 2019. The sun and the wind seem to be trying to take over the fortress of the mountain.\n\nPhoto taken February 15th, 2019\n1/1 Edition NFT\nFull size HD jpg supplied\n\nGM, Iâ€™m Phil Garcia, a French professional photographer living in the Westfjords of Iceland, the most remote region of the country. My images have been awarded in international photography competitions and major European nature photography festivals. I published several Fineart books about Iceland that have been sold over Europe.\nI am also a guide for other photographers or videographers who want to meet wildlife in Iceland or photograph its hidden landscapes. In the last years, I took part in the making of several documentaries and commercials, as a location manager, photographer or videographer. Last winter I filmed for one of the latest projects from the BBC (to be broadcasted next year).",
