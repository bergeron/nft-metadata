    "description": "We struggle to break out of the cycle of repetitive events, pushing our way through obstacles to the surface we call «tomorrow.» Even when we tell ourselves that now is not the time for love, that there are more important goals, we are looking toward tomorrow, where it will meet us. When love comes and blossoms inside you, like a bud on a tree after a long winter, you understand that this is the only reason for which you have been spinning like a snowflake all this time... This moment of pure love remains with you forever, in every cell of your body and you’re alive again...\n\nLove Tomorrow. 3D motion graphics. 00m45s. Sound art by Lo.Sai. 2022",
