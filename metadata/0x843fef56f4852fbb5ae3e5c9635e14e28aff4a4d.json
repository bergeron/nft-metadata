    "description": "Autumn pulled in over our dusty and dried land as of late. It came with the grace of rain to feed our flora and fauna enough to return some of greenery. \n\nIt has always been a difficult time of the year for many of us in the Nordic north, the darkness is unforgiving and it leads to many struggling with depression and defeciency. \n\nBut it isn't all bad, it also blesses us with the gentle warm sun for a few hours among the biting cold wind and a fauna sprinkled with colours.\n\nFor me, autumn is my time of the year, I always spent it out in the woods with my family, rummaging through the leaves for mushrooms.  \nIt comes with memories of preparations of the winter months, of good food and beloved time with my family that I always look back at with a smile.",
