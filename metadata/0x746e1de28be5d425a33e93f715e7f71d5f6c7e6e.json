    "description": "Danse Macabre known as the Dance of Death, is a medieval allegory about the universality of death. It is often portrayed as a personification of death leading a procession of people from all walks of life to the grave, reminding them of their own mortality and the fleeting nature of life. \nThe image of Death as a powerful figure, leading the dance, is meant to remind us of our own mortality and the need to enjoy and appreciate life while we can.",
