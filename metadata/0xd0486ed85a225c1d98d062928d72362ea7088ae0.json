    "description": "The Drunk Divers are a collection of NFTs that aims to build a community based upon humanitarian aid. The idea is to make a physically appealing NFT collection that presents a wide array of divers that have drinks to quench their thirst. Many of us enjoy our favorite alcoholic beverages here in the first world and sit back, relax and unwind. We do this all while others in some third-world countries want nothing more than a fresh glass of water to quench their thirst and to save them from thirsting to death. We take for granted in day-to-day life running water, but so many do not get to enjoy the blessing of clean potable water. Imagine being in this situation with the potable water that you look to in order to sustain life. We believe there could be nothing more maddening. We created the Drunk Diver NFT collection to provide clean water to communities around the world, and build a community around giving.",
