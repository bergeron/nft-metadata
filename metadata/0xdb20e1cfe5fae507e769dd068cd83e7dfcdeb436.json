    "description": "alo everyone\n\nthis is PARTY. which was started june/july 2022. it started as just the we both hate to party topline section. ive been putting this song together slowly for a lot of months and i feel so fulfilled releasing it here. its a summer beachy r&b song that also feels like a hiphop dimension. the song speaks on how i hate parties. the lyrics are all projections and fear of not having control, insecurities ruling your life. lot of these feelings originated heavy when i went to berklee for a bit. so much culture shock, so many experiences where i found and lost myself through escapism. so cool to see this conglomerate of experiences in a 3:33 song.\n\nthis was originally apart of a 13 track album of demos that was supposed to come out this year in april. i decided to release them periodically over time to build up my collector base. all my future collectors and supporters will be able to help decide my future endeavors and releases, web3 and beyond. starting in my fancy shmancy discord ;]\n\nthank you for listening. love, always. - remcycles",
