    "name": "CITY POP GIRL",
    "description": "The girl was walking in the city where it was raining heavily, and the surrounding buildings were tinged pink with neon lights.\n\nI like CITY POP. A while ago, I went to Hong Kong to buy a vinyl record of FOR YOU by TATSURO YAMASHITA. My friend asked shopkeeper, what is CITY POP? He said succinctly [Work hard, and happy to life hard, that is CITY POP] Well, people in the 1980s should feel this way when they listened to CITY POP. But young people didn't live in the 80s, did they? But why is CITY POP popular among young people?\n\nI've been hearing some DJs mix old cartoon soundtracks with rain and modern electronic noises into a new kind of music lately for months now~\nThen... I suddenly figured it out!\n\nYoung people can no longer be like people in the 80s... Even hard work still doesn't make as much money as it did in the 80s because of inflation\n\nCITY POP is derived from young people's yearning for the past [Work hard, and happy to life hard, that is CITY POP].",
