    "description": "In ancient Jewish tradition, legend suggests that when Yahweh asked Adam to name all animals, the unicorn was the first to receive it, and thus it was elevated to the highest rank. When Adam and Eve were banished from heaven, God gave the unicorn the choice of staying in Eden or going with the people. The unicorn chose the last one, and was forever blessed with compassion.",
