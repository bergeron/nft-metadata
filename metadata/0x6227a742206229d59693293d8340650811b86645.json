This photo was taken in this way to evoke the sensation one has when they pretend to look away from something that consumes their thoughts and attention in an unhealthy way but nevertheless sneak a glimpse at it. We should develop the ability to entirely avoid things that do not benefit us and concentrate on those that do.",
