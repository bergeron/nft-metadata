    "description": "Love & Relationships\n​\nThe Fool in love is exciting and spontaneous but a little bit fickle. For those in relationships, The Fool indicates being so in love you can hardly contain your excitement. However, if the person asking the question is asking about commitment, this card is linked to lack of commitment /not being ready for a commitment. For those that are single, it is a very good indicator that an impulsive, carefree romance is on the cards (or many such romances). If the Fool appears, be prepared for fun-filled romance but be careful not to miss true love if it comes your way during this time.\n\nCredit & Inspired Character : ROBO by © Matt Furie\nCard ( 1 / 22 )",
