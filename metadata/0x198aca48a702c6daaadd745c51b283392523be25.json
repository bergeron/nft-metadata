    "description": "This is Becoming your Demon/Monster of Insomnia. The voices, the restlessness of staying awake even though you are tired mentally and physically\n\nThe stress, the ticking of time as you watch the shadows dance across the walls.\n\nThe constant motion picture of your life's decisions playing nonstop in your head. The sudden jerk or movement of your leg.\n\nThe aggravation, the being miserable the next day at work due to lack of sleep\n\nYou tell yourself to fall asleep you\nYou try to cry yourself to sleep\nYou read a book, Listen to soft music, sleep hypnosis.\nYou work out to punish yourself.\nBut nothing works\n\nDon't give up \nDon't give in\n\nYou will not become that Demon or Monster.\nYou do not have to become that self Image.\n\nReach out and contact someone. A Doctor or a close friend. Reach out on Spaces and The NFT community. You are not alone. You are a valued human being that is 1 of a billion others all connected thru the universe. \n\nYou are unique and special but you are not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
