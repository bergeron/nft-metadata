    "description": "UNIT: SPKTRL QC-725\n\nDATA: The SPKTRL Quantum Containment Vessel—the QC-725 (the first of its kind)—was developed in response to the need of securely transporting inter-dimensional beings to the SPKTRL research and processing facilities located in every corner of the multiverse.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: Engaging the electromagnetic ion trap causes the inter-dimensional being to become trapped in phase with the device in the physical plane. The QC-725 renders all inter-dimensional travel impossible by blocking the quantum entanglement with particles in other dimensions and districts.\n\nWARNING: The Quantum Shielding Mechanism is to be used only for temporary transport purposes and should never, under any circumstance, be used for long-term confinement. A core meltdown must be avoided at all cost.",
