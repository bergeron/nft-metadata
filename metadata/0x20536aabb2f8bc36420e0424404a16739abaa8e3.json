    "description": "A look into... a painting 5.22 - is the first Non-Player Game (NPG) I've made, where each simple AI entity is interacting dynamically with the world around them and the world as a whole uniquely evolves over time. There is a calming river in a forest where butterflies, chickens, crows and a small multitude of other animals reside and make their way in the world. This token gives you access to the NPG to view and witness as it unfolds, for Windows, Linux and Mac.",
