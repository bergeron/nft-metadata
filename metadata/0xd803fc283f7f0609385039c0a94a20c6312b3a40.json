    "description": "Our new captain informed us that this would be a voyage the likes we hadn't ever experienced, and we laughed and drank and told him we'd be along for the trip if the pay were right. There wasn't much laughing on the third day, when the ocean before us began to bubble and churn, changing into a mist of clouds before our eyes -- two men went overboard in a panic, a third began to weep, the rest were silent.",
