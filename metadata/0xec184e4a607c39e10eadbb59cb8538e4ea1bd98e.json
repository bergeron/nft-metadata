    "description": "In Wish #1, a girl was holding a red balloon.\n\nThe red balloon expressed hope and wish to me.\nAnd the girl blew a balloon into the sky, which expresses that she wished to heaven.\n\nAnd what caught it is now the scene from Wish #2.\nThe rescue ship has arrived. Everyone must be happy.\n\nAlso, I actually had a hard time these days.\nBut while I was drawing Wish #2, I realized, \"This is how fun drawing is.\"\n\nThis picture has the same meaning as a rescue line for me.\n\nAnd\nIt's the description of the daisy flowers on her head.\n\n\nInnocence, especially with white daisies with yellow or pale centers.\nPurity – also shown by daisies that are as white as possible.\nNew beginnings, which is why they are often found in bouquets for new mothers or as gifts for children.\nTrue love – because each daisy flower is really two flowers blended together in harmony.\nThat the sender can keep a secret. Keeping a secret is one way a person can exhibit that they truly love another.\n\nsilo\n\nWish , worked in 2022",
