    "description": "If we could see the wind as it flows around us, we would see an endless number of particles dancing with incredible synchronization, to the rhythm of the dictates of the universe. **Stage IV•Winds** seeks to capture these dances and expose them through generative art.\n\n## **ConFUSION. A generative art alternative**\n\nUnlike more traditional forms of generative art, this collection is not based on one code specifically designed to produce lines or curves but is the result of mixing various algorithms where each produces a predetermined type of graphics. The enormous advantage of this system is an infinity of variables that can be intermingled to give surprising results, always maintaining that wonderful characteristic of generative art of achieving unpredictable and surprising results. In ConFUSION there will be proposals of vastly different types, and we will be presenting them progressively in this wonderful platform. Welcome to **MyGenArt**.",
