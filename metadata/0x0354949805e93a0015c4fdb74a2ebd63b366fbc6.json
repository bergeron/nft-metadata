    "description": "Resolution: 4583 x 4993 | Medium: Oil on Canvas\n\nThe Plastic Age series has been exhibited internationally including showings in the USA, Taiwan, and Europe. All artworks in this collection are originals created by renowned artist, C.J. Yeh. Every files was digitally optimized for large-scale printing or projection.\n\nYeh is a tenured professor of Art & Design at State University of New York. In this series, Yeh manually painted repetitive imageries in the same indifferent and faithful manner how you would “cut and paste” pixels on a computer. It was Yeh’s process of trying to resolve the conflicts between his fascination with new media and his classic training as a painter. While the medium is traditional, the aesthetics embedded in these paintings are digital. What is most striking is the intricacy of play between conflicting images, which Yeh uses to redefine dignity as an honest and unflinching vision turned toward one’s self.\n\n[Artist Website](https://linktr.ee/cjny)",
