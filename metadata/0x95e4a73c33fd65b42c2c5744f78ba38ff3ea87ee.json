    "description": "Where is the beginning, and where is the end? Are we in the loop? Or are we stuck? \nYou never know. And damn, who cares? \n\nDigital art and music are the answer. \nThe new collab Bad Gallery x DJ and producer Kito Jempere makes a new reality. Nostalgic aesthetic visual by Bad Gallery mixes with the latest exclusive DJ Kito Jempere track reminiscent of the polyphony of arcade game machines. \n\nBack to basic. \nJust in case, imagine that you can use your VHS like digital art. I bet most of you didn't touch VHS since childhood, or some don't even know what this is.\n\nThe main idea of the project is hidden inside the video like an Easter egg, VHS cassette, which connects the digital and the real world. The video art and the musical track were recorded on this VHS. The owner of this NFT gets an opportunity to own the tokenized idea physically.\nThrough our new NFT, you can create a new round in this endless loop of meanings. No matter which gadget you use, digital or analogue, you can continue this chain of the infinite cycle. \n\nDon't try to find the answer, just stay here. \nCreate your art through VHS, listen to music, and have fun with a high percussive journey!",
