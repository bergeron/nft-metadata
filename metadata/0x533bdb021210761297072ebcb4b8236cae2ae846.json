    "description": "\"Liquid Scanner\" aims to introduce the uninitiated into the world of web3 by being a fun, affordable project. Tokens are very limited to add to the excitement!\n\nChroma Code uses photography & A.I generated pieces that are often composited/modified using image editing software, then sent through an analog signal chain via conversion, which renders the edited image directly onto a CRT TV manufactured between the year(s) 1990 & 2002.\n\nThe signal chain consists of converters, modulators, circuit bent modules, & guitar pedals â€” all of which are working in tangent to color-grade, warp & manipulate the artwork displayed on the CRT TV. Each piece is then resampled in 4K using a DSLR camera, which captures the footage directly from the TV screen & is then imported into a video editing software for fine tuning & re-sizing. \n\nThis is a simplified explanation of the process.\n\nVideo Size: 2000 x 2000 px  \nTV Model & Year: Sylvania, 2002",
