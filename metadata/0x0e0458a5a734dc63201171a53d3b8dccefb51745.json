But do you develop mindfulness of death?\"\n-AN 6.19 (The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha)\n\nMaranasati (mindfulness of death) is a Buddhist meditation practice that uses contemplation and visualization techniques to meditate on the nature of \"death,\" understood as the interruption of the life faculty within the limits of a single becoming/existence. The cultivation and refinement of mindfulness of death is conducive to developing the right effort and urgency towards liberation.\n\n7200 x 12600 | 300 dpi | .jpg",
