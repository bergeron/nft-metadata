    "description": "In the middle of the endless taiga near the Chersky Ridge in the Verkhoyanskiy region of northern Yakutia is the Batagai thermokarst depression. Similar faults are found in Canada and Greenland, but the Siberian crater is three times larger and twice as deep as they are. Its length is more than 900 meters, and depth in some places reaches 100 meters. On the slopes of the trough, geological strata of different eras can be easily seen, by which one can easily trace the history of our planet - its climatic periods and inhabitants.",
