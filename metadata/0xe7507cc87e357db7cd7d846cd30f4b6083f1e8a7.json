    "description": "As you look into my eyes, you can see the sadness and pain I carry with me every day. I look into the distance, lost in the echoes of my past, haunted by the memories of what was and what might have been. I know that I'm not the only one who carries these burdens.\n\nWe all have moments of regret and sadness, memories that we wish we could change. But for me, these echoes are difficult to escape. They weigh heavily on my heart, reminding me of all the things I've lost, all the pain I've endured.\n\nI want you to feel the emotions that I feel, to connect with me on a deeper level. I want you to see the hardness etched into my face, the lines that tell the story of a lifetime of struggle and hardship. \n\nBut I also want you to feel the hope that still burns within me, the hope that one day I can be free of these echoes and find peace in the present.\n\n____\n\n\"Echoes of the Past\" is the first 1/1 in the collection \"Soul's Journey\". The collection will consist in seven 1/1 artworks.\nrivles 2023",
