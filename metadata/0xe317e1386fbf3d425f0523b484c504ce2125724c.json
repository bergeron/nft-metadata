    "description": "Season 1 - Pepe - It happened one day not quite today, but not so far off it couldn’t be tomorrow... Dogs of Earth discovered the existence of Woofholes! Tears in the fabric of space/time, resonating at frequencies only perceivable to the canine senses, leading to a parallel Earth. This planet was exactly like ours in all respects, filled with furnished cities and buildings, but completely empty of mankind. Having spent the past hundred centuries observing their humans and learning how to (and more importantly, how not to) run a planet, brave pups began to venture through the Woofholes. They’ve begun exploring this new and empty Earth and colonising it’s mysterious, silent cities, untouched jungles, and pristine landscape.",
