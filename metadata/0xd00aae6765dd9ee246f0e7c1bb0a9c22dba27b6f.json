    "description": "I see hope\", he whispered in pain, \"I cannot accept the lives of innocents taken by the beings of the dark\"\nAs he spat the blood with broken teeth, he said \"but that's not the only reason.\nI was sent here for you, son of the legendary dragon Horgon, the Old Gods rode his back, it was the spirit of the first dragon who sent me here.\"\n\nI'M CURSED TO ROT IN THIS PRISON FOR ETERNITY BY THE OLD GODS!!!! (ROARED THE DRAGON) \nThe man walked, limping with a broken toe towards the sword and said. \nNot anymore!! (As he pulls the sword from the skull of the giant) \n(The barrier keeping the Dragon inside the cave vanishes) \nThe Dragon with teary eyes said, I should have known this feeling when I saw you enter this cave, Master.\nDragon Tears fall upon the warrior, healing his wounds.\nGORGON, then breaks the cave top and lands outside in the sun, feeling the wind!\n\nThe warrior, on the dragon's back \nSoars the sky and flies towards evil!\n\nMusic by - Jo Wandrini (Royalty free music)",
