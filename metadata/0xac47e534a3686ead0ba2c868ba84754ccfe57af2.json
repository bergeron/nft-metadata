    "description": "Inspired by the idea of light above the visible spectrum, HYPERCOLOR utilizes alternating colors as a tool to reshape and redefine color. Continuing JIMMY’s explorations into programmable artwork, the images create the illusion of light as a digital material.\n\nBlocks of vibrating light are projected onto a 2D canvas, creating composed geometries and divisions that bounce from side to side. The work’s behavior has a scanning quality, fluctuating between states in which the beams glide calmly, pulsing and with energetic movement.",
