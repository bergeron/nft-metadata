Seagulls and pigeons fight for the crumbs. \nI am standing there, and illuminate the scene with my solid, full blown flash.\n\nAbout Céline Pannetier: \nShe is a French Photographer based in Barcelona. She is a Street Photographer whose work was finalist in several Street Photography International Festivals. She exhibited her work in galleries in NY, Paris, Barcelona and Rotterdam.\nShe also works as Events and Congress Photographer and recently started to explore Creative Food Photography for which she was finalist both of the Sony World Photo Award in 2022, and the Siena Intl Photography Award in 2021.\n\n",
