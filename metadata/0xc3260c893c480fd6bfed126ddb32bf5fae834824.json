    "description": "‘Peace for Ukraine’ is an Anti War poster inspired by some of my favorite artists, BANKSY and Shepard Fairey. It’s an original painting created directly on a sheet of 30 uncut Ukrainian Hryvnia (the local currency) which my dad got from a rare currency dealer.\n\nWe ‘fractionalized’ the original painting into 30 one-of-one NFTs which we’ll sell individually. At the same time, we’re auctioning the original IRL painting- which comes with a 1/1 NFT of the entire piece.",
