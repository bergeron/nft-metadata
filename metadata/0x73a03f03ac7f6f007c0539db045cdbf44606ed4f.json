    "description": "Times succeed one another in an endless dance of reality. It is difficult to say whether time really exists or whether it is all a fad of human consciousness. But variability and impermanence define the essence of things, and this entity also appears in those moments of existence when the cardinal changes of matter and time intertwine in a whimsical dance to reveal to us new reality\n\nBio: Bio: MelsKim is Houdini FX artist. With the help of 3D magic, he brings various stories to life in works of art in order to open up new facets of human reality for people.",
