    "description": "Mom forever. Having a child is both a blessing and a prison. In the few moments we have with our friends, we feel like zombies recovering from a war. This is a tribute to all mothers, who have the courage to stay strong and educate, a lifelong role. Gift your mother with recognition and love!"
