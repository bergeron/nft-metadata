    "description": "This is a dance video made with the rotoscoping technique. The model is Lia Kim. Music used free YouTube Music. The logo motion above is the work of motion graphic designer 'Youngae Kim'. I worked on about 200 pieces a day, and after it was made into a short clip, it was an effect collaboration work. The video you are viewing has been edited and reconstructed by the original editor.",
