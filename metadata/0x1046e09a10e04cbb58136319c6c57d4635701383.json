Feelings of inadequacies and a lack of control over personal situations compelled me to create a \"doll\" like figure.  \nHer long dark hair is ever present and manipulates her situations, good or bad. Her eyes are intense and mysterious. \nHer figure is exposed. Her feelings are exposed. She is raw and unapologetic. She is Marinette.",
