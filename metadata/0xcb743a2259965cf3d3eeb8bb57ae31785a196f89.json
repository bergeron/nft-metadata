    "description": "I've revisited this song a few times and each time was during very critical moments in my life. I first wrote the initial idea when I moved back to New York City after the initial wave of the pandemic. Then I continued to write lyrics and build out the song as I left New York and moved to Los Angeles earlier this year. This is probably one of the most personal tracks I've ever written. It's about being antsy and knowing that there's so much out there for you, but with every decision you make there's always more difficult decisions attached to it. This track is a part of my EP \"TASTE\"\n\nThis one couldn't have been nearly as special without my good friends Parker & Eldar. \n\n",
