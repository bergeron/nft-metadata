    "description": "This is my Genesis piece on Foundation!\n\nIt's part of the first collection I've created named \"Faded Dreams\"\nA collection of forgotten dreams that have nearly faded out of existence.\n\nThis is the first in the series.\n\"Floral Prism\"\n\nTook me almost 2 weeks to complete.\nI wanted to create a piece with some of my favorite colors merging and flowing together.\n\nI imagined a field of flowers as far as the eye can see all of my favorite colors.\n\nStarted this piece on September 26th 2021 around 3am. Was working on it while my 2yr old daughter was laying next to me wide awake trying to see what I was doing on my IPad for some reason lol. \nI ended up putting Bob Ross Painting episodes on the TV and his voice helped rock her to sleep.\n\nThis is one of my favorite pieces from the collection. Give it a Good Home :-)\n\n3000px X 3000px  2021",
