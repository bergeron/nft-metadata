    "description": "In the summer, it may turn red shortly after the moon rises.\nThis photo was taken by using a telephoto lens to capture the supermoon and a traditional Japanese castle (Gifu Castle) by matching the timing of the location, the moon, and the castle.\nIt is one of the most ideal photos I have taken in this series.",
