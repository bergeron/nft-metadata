    "name": "Ghost In Smoke",
    "description": "Black and white is the soul of photography. It has a different spirit, far from the tiring of colors. It continues to maintain its reputation since the beginning of photography history.\n\nThe man in the photo, Aşık Cafer, lives in a very old village in Anatolia. He is a folk poet who plays baglama and has hundreds of song compositions. He is said to be one of the last talented artists to practice this art in Anatolia. He continues to live in this remote village with his rosary in his hand, a local hat on his head and a cigarette that he never drops.\n\nThe most important detail in my portrait work is the silhouette of the ghost in the upper right part of the smoke. If you look carefully, you can see it too. Perhaps it represents the mood of the poet.\n\nCamera: Nikon D810\nLens: Nikkor 14-24 mm\nDimensions: 3998 × 4852\nResolution: 300 dpi\nLocation: Ardahan, Turkey\nDate: 05/08/2021\nEdition: 1/1",
