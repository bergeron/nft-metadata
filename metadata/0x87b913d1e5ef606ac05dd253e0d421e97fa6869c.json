Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs and Kings were entombed holding the Ankh to preserve their immortality. It unlocked their passage from this life to the next, and the Afterlife was equally important to this one.\n\nMyth and Magic drops are blackwork tattoo designs. Those who are dropped the artwork or purchased the piece on secondary have a license to get the artwork tattooed on their body.\n\nYou may also use the art as your PFP.",
