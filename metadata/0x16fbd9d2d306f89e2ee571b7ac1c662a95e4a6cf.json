    "description": "A piece I made as a study at the beginning of my journey as a digital artist. Jean Michel Basquiat is one of my favorite artist. While watching a documentary about him I discovered when he was little he was hit by a car and in the hospital for months recovering. During this time his mother gave him the book Gray's Anatomy by Henry Gray. He read this book to understand his injuries. This would go on to inspire his Anatomy Series.",
