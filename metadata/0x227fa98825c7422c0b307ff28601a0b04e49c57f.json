    "description": "In the afternoon when the sun begins to descend, shapes start to form around the stairs of the bridge. As seen in the photography, the lighted area does not stay in that shape for long. If you are lucky, you can capture a single person, preferably wearing black in that very spot with a minimalistic approach.\n\nTaken w/ Fuji XPro-2 XF8-16MMF2.8 R LM WR on March 17 2019",
