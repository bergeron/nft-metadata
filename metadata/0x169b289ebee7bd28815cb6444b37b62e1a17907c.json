    "name": "Fluffy Female ",
    "description": "During the first 2 days we were only able to see foxes from a far distance but then on the third day this beautiful and fluffy female came close to us at a perfect timing when the sun started to show up while the strong wind was blowing off the fresh snow making this exceptional condition. This is the first photo of this collection and the collector will receive a signed fine art print.",
