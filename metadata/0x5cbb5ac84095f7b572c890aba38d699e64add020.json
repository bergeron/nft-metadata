    "description": "This card inspired by Marseille tarot deck. \n \nThis card named Puppeteer. And this puppeteer is FOMO, and you are its puppet. This card symbolizes a tendency to spontaneous momentary and rash decisions. It may seem like you can't change the situation, but think of it as a chance to renew yourself and chart a path that will help you become a better version of yourself. \n \nWhen the Puppeteer card is reversed, it suggests that you have a strong will, you clearly know your goal and strive for it. The situation is under your control. \n \nHolding this card reminds to owner that being a puppet is his own choice. This card helps to control owner's FOMO.",
