    "description": "When looking at her, the men lost their heads ...\nThe young man stood at the door in a daze.\n\n\"I should have left, but as soon as these thoughts run through my head, my knees give way treacherously\"\nThe only thing he wanted at that moment was to wrap his trembling arms around her shoulders. Gently touch her lips with your lips. But no, she won’t allow it, she plays with feelings so skillfully ...\n\n- \"A few tears fall on the floor, and I look at them with a bit of surprise, because I don’t even remember the last time I cried. Men don’t know how to cry ... I turned myself into a stone, but some water suddenly broke through it ... Funny and stupid, to be honest... But still, tears bring relief and even liberation, which I have not felt since... Since the very day I met her...\"",
