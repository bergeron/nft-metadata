    "description": "â€œQuiet Storm Hourz\" is a modern song that draws inspiration from the classic 1970's radio program, The Quiet Storm. With evocative lyrics that blend real-life events such as the passing of rapper Takeoff and the experience of having his car repossessed, alongside dream sequences, all set to moody and atmospheric production from Divus. Featuring incredible artwork from Brooke. D, the track pays homage to its influences while presenting something fresh and innovative. As an extension of Dom's AfterhOurz brand, \"Quiet Storm Hourz\" showcases his unique sound and aesthetic, creating a captivating and emotionally resonant experience. ",
