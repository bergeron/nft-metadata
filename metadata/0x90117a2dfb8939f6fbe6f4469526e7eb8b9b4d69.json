    "name": "Marylin Monroe (Chinese) - China 1950s",
    "description": "Marylin Monroe, to this day, remains a WorldWide icon of both fashion and beauty but… what if she wasn’t born in Los Angeles. What if instead she was born in CCP China, and had to live out her days working on a farm with her family? \n\nInitially, I thought her life would be worse off… but then after some research… I learned that Marylin passed away depressed, at 36, from a drug overdose… and the question arose: Which version of Marylin would be happier… my version in the NFT… or the one that lived in real life? \n\nOverall, this is my take on how situation and location, which we can’t predetermine, plays such a massive role in our lives. After all, there were probably hundreds of versions of Marylins living all over the world during the 50s… but only one of them became this glorious icon that we still talk about today! \n\n(A Chinese Version of Marylin Monroe, working on a farm in the pouring rain. - Check out the detail in the background and Enjoy :)",
