    "description": "The AquaAngels manifested themselves in my work and they have become part of my visual alchemy, always exploring transformations and transmutations. \n\nThe AquaAngels belong to  my personal  subconscious mythologies, after finding out the original ArchAngel Gabriel, yes, the same Gabriel who appears in classical religious stories and also in contemporary narratives ( Evangelion), is also known as “The Angel of All Waters”, and some occult books talk about barely known descendants of the Archangel, some becoming true Angels, others turning into Fallen Angels.\n Several names have been used to call him: Taliahad, BTharsis, Niksa, etc, and is endlessly cited in the Urantia Books.\n\nThese mysterious yet beautiful AquaAngels, appear in my work with beautiful feminine forms and can only be seen  by humans  displaying their subtle wings, during just a  few fractions of a second.
