    "description": "I resigned myself to insomnia, the aimless lying and inactivity poisoning me and opposite my whole being. My gaze was also directed into the void, but this time to the one inside me. It repelled me, but each time I tried to delve deeper into it, to know what I was dealing with. The viscous, sinking feeling felt like black glue. It enveloped me with my hidden emotions, my unspoken words, and a strong wistful feeling of...\n...Loneliness?\nI was jerked wildly out of the void. I found myself in the kitchen with this pillow, already an attribute of my helplessness and a reminder of my problem. \n\"I need new ways\" it sounded in my head.\nNow there were only two: give up or fight. The problem is that once you choose to give up, you can't make any other choice.\n\nI will fight. And this time I won't go against myself. I will look for a way out, not a way to kill my identity or dissolve.\n\nWork from the series \"Loneliness\". The second work of three.",
