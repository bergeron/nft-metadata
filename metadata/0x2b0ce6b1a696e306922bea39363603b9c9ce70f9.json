    "description": "Vibrancy, colour, decadence and joy. I never felt any of these for the most part of my childhood.\n\nI was constantly being reminded that there was so much colour and beauty in the world that surrounds me.\n\nMy eye however, couldn't see past the gloam and murk that I was made to feel. And these were painted in eerie shades of black. \n\nI was expected to set myself on a path of linearity, instead, I found myself walking sideways.",
