    "description": "Virtual Product Design ™️\n( Item : Camera ＋ EVF )\n\nThis is the world's first NFT Camera Collection. As a former employee at a camera manufacturer, he is the first product designer to pioneer the field of Virtual Product Design™️\nThis project explores the possibilities of designing new products that are distinct from objects in the real world.\nThe virtual products he creates have parts floating in mid-air, or use high-quality exterior designs that are difficult to achieve at real-world prices.\nOnly with his extensive experience in creating actual products in the real world is he able to gain mastery over these products residing in between reality and the virtual realm. It is also possible to make these 3D data as objects and hold exhibitions.\nPlease enjoy these works, which have been crafted with meticulous attention to detail, for yourself.",
