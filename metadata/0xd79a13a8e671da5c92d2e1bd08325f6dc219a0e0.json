    "description": "After Land DAO’s success launching James Peter Henry’s first NFT collection, Cartels (sold out in 20 minutes), we are collaborating once again to expand James’ twisted and unique universe.\n\nStep into the Devour series. Land DAO brings something novel to the NFT ecosystem by pushing the boundaries of where art and technology meet. Land DAO teamed up with Ebay Luxury and GBK Brand Bar to bring a novel art showcase at one of the most notorious art events of the year Art Basel 2021. At the GBK’s closing night event as a part of unique live performance art experience, each Devour art piece was digitally broken down into five 'shards'. Each shard became a separate NFT and will be revealed after public mint.",
