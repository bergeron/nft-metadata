A journey with winding roads, unknown paths, sometimes hidden traps and stunning miracles.\n\nThroughout our journey we make friends, foes, find sadness, loneliness, despair but also kindness, friendship, love, happiness and hope.\n\nIt’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. Enjoy it.\n",
