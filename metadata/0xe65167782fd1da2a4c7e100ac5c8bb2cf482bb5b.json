    "description": "To my friends, listeners and collectors. \n\nYou have empowered and supported me through a transformative year for me personally and creatively.\n\nMy hope is to build a creative career that defies the stereotypes and allows me to be creatively free in the face of industry trends and dated views of what an artist should do and be in order to be 'successful'.\n\nYou are the foundations that I didn't know i needed, and I can't wait to share the next year with you all\n\nIf you would like join the community to gain access to behind the scenes content, exclusive perks and just general vibes then find me on socials and join the collectors telegram via the link in my bio\n\nThank you \n\nJamie x",
