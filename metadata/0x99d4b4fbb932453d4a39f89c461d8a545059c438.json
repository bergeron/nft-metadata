    "description": "This was the first ever track I fully self-produced that didn't sound like a basicbish beat. It was also the first music I made after completely abandoning & deleting my old artist project. Something awakened, literally over night. The Talking Palm Tree was essentially the official doula for the birth of ALYSS and the first offering from my upcoming Answers EP (track 1/5).\n\nAt the time of writing the lyrics, I was learning about the Lilith archetype in both astrological and mythological terms. Symbolically, Lilith represents everything natural, raw and untouched. She is the place of total freedom within each of us. The place we are unashamedly who we are without limitation, self-judgement or fear of what the world thinks. Energetically, she is the unconfined wild side we've locked away and after having caged myself creatively for so long, discovering her felt like a huge kick up the ass to all the blocks I’d built up inside.\n\nThe same way she initiated a dormant voice within me through 'The Talking Palm Tree’, it only felt right that she lay the ground for my genesis footstep into the terrain of web3. May this song activate a core essence within you. We see you <3 ♅\n\n\nLyrics\n\nThat's the first connection\nYou should treat all things as spirit\nThat's the first connection\n\nNever seen a place\nNever been like this one here\nCrystals fallin' down\nKinda like on Jupiter\nMirrors everywhere\nReflecting back all of our fears\nAnd there's faces not like ours\nSwear we've landed in Utopia\n\nCause we're in freedom\nAnd this is what it feels like\nCause we're in freedom\nAnd this is what it feels like\n\nPicked an apple from the tree of life\nHope no one saw\nYeah, we tried to push the boundaries\nThey all clapped their hands and cheered us on\n\nCause we're in freedom\nAnd this is what it feels like\nCause we're in freedom\nAnd this is what it feels like\nAnd we are so high, so high, so high\nTalkin' 'bout this freedom\nCause we're in freedom\nAnd this is what it feels like\n\nThat's the first connection\nYou should treat all things as spirit",
