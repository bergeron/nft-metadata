    "description": "Following up on her 2022 single “Yeehoo!” Lauren Juzang returns on March 1st,  with her second single “It’ll Be (Video Game Song)” !\n\nThe song “It’ll Be” describes the brutal emotional process of evaluating if a relationship is still serving you or not. Naturally, there’s a back and forth that occurs, but ultimately, the disappointment settles and growth can begin from it. Lauren’s ethereal voice and words of contemplation are accompanied by electronic synths that weave with acoustic guitar and banjo to create a track that is completely singular.\n\n“I got to play around with a lot of melodies and rhythms on this one,” Lauren says about the writing process. “Sonically, it’s a bit more experimental of a direction that I haven’t ventured into before. My roommate also said it sounds like a video game, hence the title.” “It’ll Be (Video Game Song)” was co-written and produced by Aidan Spiro at Heavy Duty Studios in LA.",
