    "description": "Call it my Genesis artwork.\n\nHonoring the beginning of Crypto, this piece is dedicated to the origins of Bitcoin. A birth against the backdrop of the financial crisis 2008/2009, deep forum discussions and cypherpunk mailing lists.\n\nRemember, when the Chancellor was on the Brink of the Second Bailout for the Banks. When finally someone solved the double-spend problem. When Timothy May's vision came an inch closer. When Nick Szabo and Hal Finney had to admit defeat.\n\nBit gold was lost, the US Dollar was lost, Bitcoin was born.\n\nYou know what I mean, you have been following this.",
