    "description": "Dreaming Awake.\n1/1 by Sara Boychuk.\n\nMist rolls into the depths of the mountains and surrounding lake.  A calm and quiet exists here without a single soul.  \nBalancing on the natural log bridge without descending into the lake - stillness is necessity here. \nAn ongoing lesson of stillness and meditation no matter the destination. A constant practice in daily life.\n\nThis is what dreaming awake feels like.\n\n\n\nThis image is part of a series of ethereal portraits in the Canadian wilderness.  A subsection of Sara Boychuk's work that focuses on adornment and exploration.  The constant search of the juxtaposition of stillness meets wilderness.  These peaceful moments in the harsh conditions play on our perception of what's possible.  This body of work is meant to show boundless potential and infinite possibility.  Be Boundless.\n\n",
