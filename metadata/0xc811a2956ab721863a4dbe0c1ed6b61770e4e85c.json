    "description": "A gleaming white retaining wall bisects two vibrant blue salt ponds. The crystal clear turquoise water reveals patterns and textures from previous salt harvests. \n\nI captured this abstract image while flying over the salt ponds at Useless Loop near Denham in Western Australia. The ponds get their colours from different types of algae, and the vibrancy varies depending on the time of day.",
