    "description": "Somewhere in Spain, the sun rises to light up  this little village. \nIt is lost behind the mountains, by the sea, yet quite well known because it is the village of the famous Salvador Dali.\n\nI arrived there a morning, a lovely weekend with a woman that i never saw again.\n this village is for me a true piece of art, I will forever remember this morning which was like a dream.\n\nthis timelapse was very difficult to achieve.\n there was a lot of wind.\nBut as Salvador Dali said: “No masterpiece in laziness!”",
