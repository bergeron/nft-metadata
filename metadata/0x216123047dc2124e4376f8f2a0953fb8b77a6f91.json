    "description": "Land pollution can affect the earth's environment in general. Land pollution leads to the reduction of forest cover. This, in turn, affects the amount of rain. Less rainfall means less vegetation. The effects of different types of pollution eventually lead to problems such as acid rain, greenhouse effect, and global warming. All these problems have already started and must be stopped before the situation gets out of control. So let's help save the earth for future generations.",
