    "description": "Dreamworld is a piece that showcases everything I love about capturing low fog. This photo comes closest to realizing the surreal feeling that being above the clouds and witnessing them roll over the hills below gives me. Soft sunsets like the one on this particular evening are special as they enhance the atmosphere even more and make for these surreal, dreamy conditions. Looking back at this picture takes me right to the moment it was captured, during a warm summer evening on my favorite mountain top with a few great friends. I get lost in photos like these often, partially due to the memories associated with them but also the soothing feeling they give. The fog waves have mesmerized me since I first saw one and even though I rarely get the opportunity to get above the clouds these days, it will always be one of the most stimulating photography experiences I can imagine. \n",
