    "description": "Sculpture/Photography\n15 inches x 20 inches PNG\n330 ppi\n\nE. Tulving’s theory of Chronesthesia inspired this sculpture made of wire and white bandages. Chronesthesia is a kind of “mental time travel”. Put simply, it says that as humans, we have the capability to remember our past and thus be aware of our future. It is a major part of our evolution, but also comes with the burden of anxiety, depression, and over thinking. \n\nThis sculpture depicts a person experiencing the weight and loneliness of such burdening thoughts. The bandages represent the various things we do to distract ourselves from bad thoughts and anxiety- but no matter how many pills you take or movies you watch, it is still there. The negative space represents exactly that- the negative space in our heads that isolate and bring us down. It is overwhelming and all-consuming. ",
