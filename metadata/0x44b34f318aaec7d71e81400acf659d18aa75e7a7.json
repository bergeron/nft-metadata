    "description": "Proof of Work is a series of manually generated images. Each graphic pixel corresponds with one keypress, resulting in images where visual density is directly correlated with physical effort. The artist attempts to enter colour values randomly, but the difficulty of this task results in patterns in the image, which attest to the manual process of creation. The images were generated daily, the pixel canvas size doubling each day until one image could not be completed in one day.\n\nVideo: QmSUcs2dV6TWaSxS5ZEdWvhm9aDHB1ZuDMCbfsgWtD3VFb   \n\nCollector Information: QmcUxoiWcqC3a4pzJWg4wdRMEk25RxkWvLVtPh76kHykCD",
