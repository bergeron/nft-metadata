    "name": "The Photo That Ruined My Life",
    "description": "In 2013 I participated in a TechCrunch Disrupt interview called “Founders Stories with Rap Genius.”\n\nI wore a floral Moods of Norway sport coat and blue-tinted Ray-Ban sunglasses, both of which I came to regret, especially the sunglasses.\n\nThough this image is almost nine years old, it is the first Google Image result for `tom lehman genius`, the easiest way to find photos of me.\n\nI don’t want this photo to represent me, but I cannot remove it from Google Image search, and I fear I could only unseat it from the #1 spot with a photo that made me look even worse.\n\nHaving unsuccessfully fought this image for years, I have decided that acceptance and opposite action is the better path.\n\nThis NFT flips my approach and the photo on their horizontal axes, indelibly inscribing it into the Ethereum blockchain so that I never have to worry about trying to delete it again.\n\nPhoto: Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\nLicense: [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en)",
