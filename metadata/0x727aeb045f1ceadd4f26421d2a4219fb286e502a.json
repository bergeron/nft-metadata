    "description": "Times Square, August 2022\n\nIt felt like forever since I had a chance to shoot early enough to catch that ever so elusive morning light. Times Square was my first stop. As the sun began to peak through the valley of skyscrapers, a truly magnificent orange glow began to emerge. I knew that If I shot directly into it and had my shutter set fast enough, the result would be some super clean silhouettes. I also couldn’t help but notice the daily commuters paying absolutely no attention to their surroundings, catching up on whatever it is they use their phones to catch up on. Then, it was only a matter of patience and timing to capture this “tech neck” phenomenon in action. We’re in fact doomed.",
