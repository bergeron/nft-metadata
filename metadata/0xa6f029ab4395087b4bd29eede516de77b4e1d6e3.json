    "name": "Beauty behind the madness",
    "description": "History likes to display madness as a force that overwhelms the masses and as such was rejected. Indeed there were times in which it almost lead us into insanity. \n\nNonetheless, for the good occurences, once one finds comfortability in madness, the beauty behind it reveals itsself. \nSuddenly we love the new things, ideals and progress that come along with madness. \nYou wouldn't want to live in another age of time. \n\nWinner gets a Certificate of Authentcity along with an acrylic photo print.
