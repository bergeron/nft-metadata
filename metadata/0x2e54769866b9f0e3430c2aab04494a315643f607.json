    "description": "In the depths of despair,  \nA human being does dwell,  \nLost in the darkness,  \nOf their own private hell.\n\nThe weight of the world,  \nRests heavy on their soul,  \nAs they struggle to cope,  \nWith a life out of control.\n\nTheir thoughts spiral downward,  \nInto a bottomless pit,  \nAs they drown in sadness,  \nAnd can't seem to quit.\n\nBut amidst the shadows,  \nThere's a flicker of light,  \nA glimmer of hope,  \nThat can make things right.\n\nThough the road is long,  \nAnd the journey is tough,  \nThey must keep pushing forward,  \nFor it's never enough.\n\nThere's beauty in the struggle,  \nAnd strength in the pain,  \nAs they rise from the darkness,  \nAnd find peace once again.\n\nFor the human spirit is resilient,  \nAnd can overcome any test,  \nSo let hope be their guide,  \nAs they rise above the rest.",
