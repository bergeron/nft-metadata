    "description": "This is my 4th 2-panel mosaic I've captured since the dark nights returned in September here in Scotland.  I really wanted to challenge myself this time round and mosaics seemed a good place to start!\n\nThis is a total of 15.5 hours of integration time over the 2 panels.  I captured this using a telescope and camera on top of an equatorial mount to capture the data from my back garden. \n\nI then calibrated, stacked, stitched and processed it in PixInsight with my desired false SHO colour palette that I've started to use for some of my narrowband work.  I then added the stars to the nebula image separately in Photoshop.\n\nThe California Nebula also known as NGC 1499 is an emission nebula located in the constellation Perseus.  Its name comes from its resemblance to the outline of the US State of California.  It lies at a distance of about 1,000 light years from Earth.  The California Nebula was discovered by E. E. Barnard in 1884.\n\nLicence: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
