    "description": "Our character grew up in a very poor blockchain. As he got older, he reached the top of the metaverse. During the day, he is a very respected member of society, but when the night comes around, he becomes a ruthless gangster. He has a split personality, turning into a mutant during a solar eclipse. Heâ€™s developed into the villain of the metaverse. \n Meta Street Code is a very exclusive project with the highest quality artists, designers, and businessmen standing behind it. To make this project as exclusive as possible, the overall supply of this collection will be 3000 NFTs. Out of those NFTs, 1,000 will be sold to our Whitelist Members (to avoid paper hands) for a special price of 0.075 ETH. We will mint the rest (2000 NFTs), so that we will all make money on the secondary market (OpenSea) together as a community!"
