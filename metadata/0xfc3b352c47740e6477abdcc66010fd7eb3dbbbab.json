Khanaman\nTitle: “Toward the Light”\nCreation Date: 9/17/2022 - 10/5/2022            \nMedium: Acrylic \nSize: 40” x 40” Stretched on canvas 1.5” gallery wrap \nProject: Toward the Light as commissioned by Brian Carson https://briancarsongroup.com/\n\nDescription: The equinox is here, yet the balance we expected is not. Struggles persist; dark reminders of loss and pain remains prevalent. Collectively we must gather in peace and pursue a bolder path forward. Escaping the burdens that seek to weigh us down, we then emerge into the promise of a brighter tomorrow, carried on the wings of the dove.",
