    "description": "Working as a dancer in the Chinese nightclub with my dance group and being a photographer at the same time I had a huge luck to capture the most interesting and cinematic moments of the behind-the-scenes life. \nThere is more burlesque than on the stage, the concentration of sexual fluids is more powerful than oxygen. There’s no falsehood – it’s not a scene, it’s their everyday life, our life, or rather mine.\n\nWork 71 of 82\nChina, Chengdu, 2016\n\nFor each collector of this series of works, I have a present - an exclusive video which consists of backstage photos and videos where I am showcasing some life moments of the behind-the-scenes. \n\nThe physical series was exhibited and is in private and public collections in Hong Kong, UK, France, USA, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Lithuania, etc.\n\nLeica Oskar Barnack Award Newcomer 2017\nParis Photo 2017",
