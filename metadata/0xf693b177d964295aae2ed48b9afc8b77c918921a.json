    "description": "Imagine you are trapped in a dark and small room; you will feel suffocated; Fear of potential suffocation in a limited space; psychologists call it Claustrophobia; the irony is that most of us spend most of our lives in confined spaces - we call home and we feel safe! \nThe same psychologists who call fear of a confined spaces chlastrophobia, call \"the need for confined space for living\" a primary element for feeling safe in life! \nSo what is the difference between feeling claustrophobic and safe? The difference is the \"way out\"... \nSeeing \"there is a way out\" makes us feel safe in a confined space without feeling claustrophobic. \n\n Now, what about our thought limits? Why we feel claustrophobic when we are confined in a space without a clear way out, but we feel ok without seeing a way out of our thoughts and beliefs. Should we be claustrophobic when we think we know it all and right?",
