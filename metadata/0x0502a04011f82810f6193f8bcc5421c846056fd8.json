    "description": "In late 2021 I was in a twitter space with 2 nft art legends @blockmuse and @ArtAsAnarchy where Art started to question me about my techniques and someone called Sugimoto. I had no idea who this was but it opened my mind to this great artist and style of photography. \n\nOne day I hope to be on his level.\n\nMy first but not last offering in this style.",
