    "description": "The 2117 citizenship comes with a full set of unique benefits. Citizens will be called Bedu as an ode to the Bedouins, the semi-nomadic people who survive life in a harsh desert environment and are celebrated for their hospitality. To be a Bedu in 2117 means you are ready for the tough journey and settling of a hostile planet, while you embrace all those that come with you. \\\\n\\\\nCITIZENS (BEDU) BENEFITS: \\\\n\\\\n • Lifetime citizenship income (a % of the revenues made in 2117 get redistributed to the citizens as dividend on a quarterly basis). \\\\n\\\\n • Free drops across the 2117 seasons. \\\\n\\\\n • Contribution into building the different elements in the 2117 world.",
