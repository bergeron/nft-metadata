    "description": "Earth, our one and only home. One that we as a species are single-handedly destroying, right before our very eyes. It's an incredibly harrowing thought; to think that we are witnessing the utter destruction of our only home.\n\nIt always disturbs me how people treat this Earth. How they treat it as something disposable, willing to trash it without a second thought.\n\nI always thought that if more people spent even just the tiniest bit more time outside, especially in places like Sequoia National Park, where you feel so small and insignificant below the towering trees, that they might think different. That they might realize that we humans are not above any other living being. We are all part of one ecosystem, and that we must live in harmony with it; not to treat our Earth as if it were here ~for~ us. \n\n100% of proceeds from this sale will go directly to Rainforest Foundation US who are trying and take action against climate change and the deforestation of our Earth. \n",
