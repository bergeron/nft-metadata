    "description": "\"DEKOTORA\" is a particular culture in Japan. These trucks have large bodies that are decorated with lights, chrome-plated decorative parts, traditional artwork, and other bright exterior decorations. \n\nThe number of DEKOTORA has been decreasing since the boom of the 1970s. One time, there were over 3,000 DEKOTORA cars in Japan, but 2022 has reduced the number to 500 because of a lack of corporate compliance. \n\nWe create a 3D work of art of the existing trucks and inherit the DEKOTORA culture to future generations.\n\nThis DEKOTORA appeared in GUCCI's PV for Fall/Winter 2016-17. Mr. Sekino, the truck owner, has been a trucker since he was 18. He has always had a humble personality and trusted everyone. Misaki's beautiful decorations are mostly DIY work by Mr. Sekino, and the beauty is truly an art. Also, please note the painting on the side of the truck in memory of his late niece.\n",
