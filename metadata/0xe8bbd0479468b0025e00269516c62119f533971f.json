    "description": "LandTrust Vault #1 NFTs are backed by Sandbox land. By purchasing the NFT, you become an owner of the Sandbox metaverse land fraction.\n\nLandTrustâ€™s Vault #1 pools together ETH by selling NFTs. It then bids below the floor to buy Sandbox land. The acquired lands will be listed at 2x for the next 360 days and once sold, you'll receive proceeds proportional to the number of NFTs you own in the Vault #1.\n\n- Vault #1: Issuance: 80 NFTs\n\n- Strategy by LandTrust: 2x Flip or auction off at the end of 360 days."
