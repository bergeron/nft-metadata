I'm so grateful for all the artists and collectors I met during the last year.\n\nI want to celebrate this one year anniversary with a special drop.\n\nEvery wallet that bids on this artwork will receive a free commemorative NFT from me.\n\nThank you so much to everyone who supported me!\n\nI can't wait to see what the next 365 days will bring me.",
