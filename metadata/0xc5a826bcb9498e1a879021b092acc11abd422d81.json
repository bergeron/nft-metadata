    "description": "This is my first generative art infused artwork on Superrare, digging deeper and deeper into my artistic exploration.\n\n\"Heimdall stands up and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his strength. He wakens all the gods who then hold an assembly. Odin now rides to Mimir's Well, seeking council for both himself and his followers. The ash Yggdrasil shakes, and nothing, whether in heaven or on earth, is without fear.\" Gylfaginning, Chapter 51.",
