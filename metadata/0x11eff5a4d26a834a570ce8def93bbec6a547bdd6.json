    "description": "We did not know of the existence of the Tolteka Mekas until the 40's, when a group of archaeologists discovered  the first one. This finding caused a lot of controversy in the academic environment of traditional archaeology, for them it was inconceivable that this technology existed for more than two thousand years.  \nThe first Meka was activated a year after its discovery with the help of a group of unionized electricians who did electrical connection work in the surrounding towns. From this first find, archaeologists began to find more and more Mekas buried within inches of the jungleâ€™s surface. From medium Mekas to small toy Mekas that resembled monkeys or deities relevant to the ancient Toltecs.  \nThey immediately set about connecting and reactivating each of the new Mekas and the news of each of these findings caused excitement in the national and international press. The Mekas were immediately the sensation and people began to create their own Mekas, thus reactivating an ancient culture.",
