    "description": "In commemoration of The Flip's podcast episode on The Ownership Economy in Africa - in which we explore what permissionless, web3-enabled tools and platforms mean for African creators and consumers - we've partnered with Senegalese digital artist Linda Dounia to mint this AI-generated art collection, Dawn of Bugs. \n\nBoth the episode and this collection explores questions of value - at the intersection of creativity and technology - as African artists take advantage of new web3 tools and paradigms. What is valuable? And who gets to decide?\n\nInspired by Frank Herbert's Dune - and the sandworm whose larvae is the most valuable commodity in the universe - Linda's work focused on the social construction of power and the cultural implications of how it is distributed. \n\n4000x4000 pixels / 20 sec animation",
