    "description": "Back in 1829, travelers led their trading caravan from Texas to Los Angeles.\n\nFor many miles around only the desert stretched, and the scorching sun exhausted the already tired travelers. They lost their way and it seemed that the road that should lead them out of these places was irretrievably lost.\n\nAll that was left for them was to go in search of a source of water in order to survive in this desert.\nThe daredevils did not give up and soon they found a saving oasis, in which there was a source of artesian water.\n\nThis Place was called Las Vegas, which means \"fertile valleys\" in Spanish.\n\nThe Mojave Desert in Nevada, which never seemed to have life, is now a legend to anyone who hears its name.\n\nThis city rightfully occupies an important place in the Utopia Universe, as a symbol of hope and fortitude. \n\nEveryone can find their own oasis. A place that can breathe life into it.",
