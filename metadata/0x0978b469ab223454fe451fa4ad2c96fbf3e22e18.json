    "description": "»**Between Ice and Fog**« is the story of the final day of my Antarctic voyage on the sailing ship Bark Europa near the Melchior Islands in the Palmer Archipelago, told in nine photographs.\n\nWatching as giant icebergs materialized from the ghostly fog, surrounded by the sound of wind and water, I was struck by their surreal textures and immense size. The unreal landscape and unique wildlife I encountered in that beautiful place is something I may never fully grasp. \n\nAs we started the return trip across the Drake Passage bound for Argentina, I already knew I had to return one day. Until then, I am grateful to be able to share my experience in Antarctica with the world through this collection.\n\n**64° 19′ 12″ S, 62° 56′ 9″ W**\n\nCollection: Between Ice and Fog [**NLS-001**]\nby [Northlandscapes, Jan Erik Waider](https://www.northlandscapes.com), 2022",
