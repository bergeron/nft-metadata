    "description": "\"Blue Monday\"\n\nThe moment when physical and digital, comes into contact\n\n\"The contact\"\n\n\"The Contact\" is a project that explores the relationship between the physical and digital worlds.\n\nThe artist uses tools to create His work on the screen. There is an exact moment when the physical, comes into contact with the digital and it is at that point that the work of art is created. This contact allows the digital to influence the work of art, creating a unique experience for the viewer.\n\nAll that happens in the moment of contact is uncontrollable, the digital begins to create completely autonomously.\n\nThe result is a harmony of color and shade that brings the observer into a meditative state",
