    "description": "Pysanky are traditionally decorated Ukrainian Easter eggs. The egg is dyed one color at a time, and for each color, a layer of wax is drawn on, protecting those areas from the next color of dye. Once the last color has dried, the wax is melted off, revealing the final design.\n\nPysanka #1 is based on a traditional pattern. (My grandfather once dyed an egg in this same design!)\n\nArt by SAWCHAK.eth  \nSoundscape by AbelOkugawa.eth\n\nMP4  \n30 sec  \n2048x2048\n\nMade in 2022\n\nAssets used: \n\n\"flowers with the vase\" (https://skfb.ly/6RtYS) by Gajk.Mv is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nhttps://freesound.org/people/squashy555/sounds/269244/",
