    "description": "HitWavez x Hurric4n3Ike, a monumental Music NFT to this dreamy, inspirational BANGER and opening song of my first ever Metaverse concert the 'HitWavez' x Hurric4n3Ike . I play this song at almost every metaverse concert. Being an Artist with no permanent home, this song documents my story of the one thing that DID stay consistent in my life, making hits. From Houston, to Indianapolis, to Dallas, to Austin, to Orlando, to Costa Rica, 'We Makin' Hits Up On The Road Though!'. Ladies and Gentlemen The 'HitWavez'.\n\n“The odds of making a hit song is about 1 in 10^7. The Odds of YOU simply existing is 1 in 10^2,685,000. So You, my friend, are a hit millions of times over.” - Hurric4n3Ike ",
