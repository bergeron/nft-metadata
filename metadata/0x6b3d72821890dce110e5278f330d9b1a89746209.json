    "description": "Invitation is an unpublished self-portrait and is part of a series of portraits related to feelings and states like reflection, resilience or desire.\nIt represents the shyness and the impossibility of saying what we want, and only our body language tries to communicate with the hope of being read and decoded by the receiver. This image moves to the darkness, which is always an uncertain exploration and where anything can happen; we decide to move in or out, or in other words, we can hold his hand or leave it and think how would have been such an experience.\n\nOriginal dimensions: 2592 x 3888 px\nBlack and white portrait, original.\nSelf-portrait.\n\nTags: desire, sensual, pansexual, polysexual, body language, communication, shyness, lgbtq+, black and white, concept, darkness,\nsex, love, sensory, ",
