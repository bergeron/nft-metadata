    "description": "In a dystopic version of Gotham City, the streets are filled with crime and corruption, and the city is ruled by powerful criminal organizations. The atmosphere is dark and oppressive, with towering skyscrapers and grim, dilapidated buildings looming over the streets. The streets are littered with trash and debris, and the air is thick with pollution and the smell of decay.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Batman patrols the city, a dark and brooding figure shrouded in mystery and secrecy. His costume is a sleek, retro-inspired outfit with a bat-themed emblem emblazoned on his chest. He wears a long, flowing cape and a cowl that hides his face, and his body is toned and muscular from years of training and combat.\n\nRoBot",
