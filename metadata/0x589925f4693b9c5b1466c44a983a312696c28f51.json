    "name": "Ravenness",
    "description": "Travelling across a desolate town, you catch a glimpse of a dark figure.   The name “Ravenness” comes to mind and you attempt to get her attention, but no sooner than you try to call her, she is gone without  any signs of her, without even a footprint.    As you turn back around to retrace your steps back home you again see Ravenness.  This time you call her name and the woman has no reaction, but the Raven on her shoulder lets out a loud screech.   It is at this time that you turn your gaze elsewhere as you know that any additional gaze in their direction would be your last.",
