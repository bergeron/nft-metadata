    "description": "Who are Beachcrimes? We’re a duo from LA and we spent the last year making songs in hotel rooms around the world. Beachcrimes is the soundtrack to that adventure.\n \nWe made a lot of songs, and we’re excited to share them. All of them. This year we’re releasing 24 songs in 48 weeks. If we’re being real, it’s actually two albums – there’s AM and there’s PM. AM is the lite stuff, PM is the nite stuff. Think of it like the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, but for dance music.\n\n\"Melody (In My Head)\" is the 4th of these 24 songs. It's the 2nd single from our AM album and we made it in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. What would 75 & sunny sound like? We think it would sound like this. Heartbreak wrapped up in a tropical euphoric piano-house banger. If you happen to find yourself on a boat, pair to the bluetooth ASAP and be sure to give this one a spin. It will play just fine.\n\nNext single will be out 2 weeks from today, and the following single 2 weeks after that.",
