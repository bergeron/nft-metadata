    "description": "Persian Calligraphy is an amazing way to explain what is happening in history of Iran. Because artists who now live or have lived in this country and even emigrated now, they can not discribe very clearly what they want to say, not only for the restrictions imposed by the government, but also for the \"Shame\" that can not be itself. Yes, \"Shaming\" and in fact a \"Historical Shaming\", so the artists of this land have always said their words in an aura of ambiguity;  And this is the secret of the beauty and difference of Iranian Art, unlike Western or Eastern (japoneas) Art.  Now this NFT ART is my first digital artwork in the Iranian or Persian Calligraphy (typography) style, And this is a collection of several paintings that I could not display in time due to migration, and this collection continues.",
