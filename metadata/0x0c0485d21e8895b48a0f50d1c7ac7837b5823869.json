    "name": "The Great Heart Schism",
    "description": "Along the edge of the Catarine Wail, lies an impossible boundary known as ‘The Great Heart Schism”. We are very familiar with this cluster of the void as it was first discovered by the Catalog nearly 300 years ago. This area is known as the Gald Vortex, and it was one of the very first targets of study after initializing the lens. Surprisingly, we still do not know whether or not we are looking at our own universe. Even after all these years. All these names. Personally I see imagery like this to be cathartic…or somewhat spiritual considering the vast amount of stars within the window. There could be an array of life portrayed within the image…or there could be nothing but dying luminaries. Either way, the lens guides the imagery, and for whatever reason it has allowed us to witness the Schism for many, many years. There was initially a great debate as to why the lens first showed this to us, hence the name. The Great Heart Schism….one of the oldest windowed images we have on record.",
