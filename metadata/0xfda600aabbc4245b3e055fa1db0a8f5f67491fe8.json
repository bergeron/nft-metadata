    "description": " A tinge of color is all we need to make the ride of life from black and white to lively. My morning stroll on the Ghats of Varanasi blessed me with a moment where nature painted itself in beautiful hues of the sky as well as human characters. \n\nOne step closer to the banks of river Ganges I saw an elderly woman praying to the holy river while the boats were traversing the distance which meant that all of us need that hope which helps us on the journey to the other side of the world. Faith in her eyes and the colors in the sky made me feel that beyond those dull mornings with no sign of hope we can bridge those gaps. The birds flying in the rally were instances of unrestrained imagination. \n\nThis site where everything came together so flawlessly is the most prized memory for me.\n\nLocation- Varanasi, India\nEdition- 1/1\nDimensions- 5561 x 3713",
