    "description": "This work should be experienced as a radio edit single of a rather heavy conceptual audio-visual sound art piece. It consists of distinct elements as such: image-to-audio conversions of the Writing Token and anticommune. thumbnails as white noise; gokhan telling himself that he is still sitting in a smart contract; a loop trial in Logic Pro; a modular synthesis of no source colors on a modular video synth emulator. All media utilized into the production thereof are pro-licensed.",
