    "description": "Fluid universe why? Because\nI have started liking things in motion,\nMaybe cause there's so much of me in motion,\nEverything happened so fast, by the time I realised it,\nIt was over and people were in motion,\nI kept holding on,\nBut everyone else was in motion,\nI still kept holding on,\nJust looking at people in motion,\nSomedays it broke my heart,\nI tried to be in sync with other people's motion,\nBut I couldn't do it,\nI lost myself,\nAnd in search of myself,\nI started being in motion,\nRunning, jumping, exploring,\nJust to find myself,\nThat's why I like motion cause,\nThat is the only way I can find myself.",
