    "description": "The symbolism of the ancestral warrior. Encoded throughout our DNA is the prayer: the spiritual negotiation between one's heart, mind & soul that calls in our ancestors.\n\nThe Universal Guard and God.\nThe protector against the mob.\nThe tribal yell inside the wishing well.\nThe dreamy spell awakens the rebel.\n\nDreamglyph Pearls and promises.\nAncestral scars are inscribed across our faces.\nThe language of the Divine etched by Goddesses.\nThat is what we behold in one another's countenances.\n\nScarred and skewed, marred and maimed.\nEnduring life's hardships are not in vain.\nBeauty comes from living through pain.\nBreathing through the injustices and strain.\nPower and purpose pulse through each vein.\n\nWe are the spoken for, never broken more.\nHerein lies behind our eyes the open door.\nDiving deep into our soul's ocean and shore.\nIs the message that guides us to Evermore.\nWhere there is no war, just the Divine's mystical lore.\nThe garden of God where life's goodness has an everlasting encore.",
