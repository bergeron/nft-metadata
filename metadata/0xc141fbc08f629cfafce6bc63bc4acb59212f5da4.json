    "description": "This token grants mxtter DAO Membership \n\nArtwork from the collection: AZAR \n\nAZAR, the mxtter genesis collection, is inspired by the \"test prints\" of screen printing. Screenprints are created one color, one layer at a time. Typically, artists or printers test each layer before starting the print run, using pages from previous prints or misprinted paper. These sheets slowly gather more layers of color and artworks from different artists. \n\nThe resulting prints are impossible to plan -- accidents and imperfections are welcomed. \n\nWith AZAR, MendezMendez and Ger wanted to transfer this concept to the world of art generated by code. They have created layers and layers of textures, color spots, halftones, collages, and various illustrations to create unique pieces, letting the code randomly define what will happen to each one. AZAR is a tribute to imperfection, mistakes, and randomness, from which beautiful things are born.",
