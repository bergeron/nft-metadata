    "description": "This series of images created as an Ai experience, portrays women as warriors adorned with flowers instead of weapons. This series is inspired by the first memory of my childhood suffering domestic violence with my mother and sister. The memory of that event has been etched in my mind and has inspired me to create this series as a form of catharsis.\n\nThrough these images, I aim to subvert the traditional portrayal of women as weak and vulnerable. Instead, I showcase them as powerful, fierce warriors who are capable of overcoming any obstacle. The flowers in their adornment serve as a symbol of growth, renewal, and beauty in the midst of darkness and pain.\n\nMy hope is that this series will inspire and empower women who have experienced trauma to find their inner strength and beauty. I also hope to spark a conversation about the prevalence of domestic violence and the need for change in our society.",
