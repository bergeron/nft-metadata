    "description": "Traces is the first release from my debut ep Real Friends.\n\n“Traces is inspired by the way memories and experiences trigger your emotions. In particular, the way that the tiny moments are what stick with you most about a person when you are faced with losing them; The touch of a hand, a look, the air … these tiny traces of a moment that encapsulate all of your emotional connection.” - Jamie\n\nThe Traces music video is a collaboration with visual artist Jackson Ducasse (Dua Lipa, Jc Stewart, John Legend, Blondie, RITUAL). A beautifully directed analog-influenced film that invokes a deep feeling of escapism.  Drawn to the way Ducasse is able to convey beauty in life’s simplicities, Jamie says it’s his gift for story-telling and evoking emotional connection that made him the perfect artist to collaborate with.\n\nNFT grants access to:  \nFull Res File  \nUnreleased Extended Mix  \nFuture unreleased music for NFT holders only  \nExclusive mashups and remixes",
