    "description": "We had to go up the rocky and rough (yet remarkably stunning) mountains for a small shoot. The only gear you can take there is the one you can carry yourself and the one that can be carried by the mules (up to a certain point). The latter would be equipped by the locals - an incredible mixture of sincere hospitality and \"marks\" of a rather rough life experience.",
