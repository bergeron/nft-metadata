    "description": "One day, walking down the street, I looked into the yard to shorten the path and I saw a mannequin, he was put up to the garbage containers, he was all in gold,it was not broken and I was even sorry. In the middle of rotten old boards, mud wrappers. It made a strong impression on me. I just approached and took a picture, 12 years have passed, but it still evokes in me those first memories and feelings of what I saw. Thrash and gold, made in black and white technique.",
