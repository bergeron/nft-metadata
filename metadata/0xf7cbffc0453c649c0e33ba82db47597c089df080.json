    "description": "Its is quite dangerous to walk the field full of grass if you use brain implants without special protection. Kolosok can intercept the cache file with Electromagnetic radiation, hold it for a short period and disassemble it. Every brain implant maker company assures that their devices are full protected and secure because of its unique encryption. But this grass can easily crack it, so be careful, it could be used to steal some info from short-term memory. \n\nBenefits\nCan be reconfigured to mute desirable sectors of short-term memory. Big amount of Kolosok-dissasembler can even affect and mute any fragment of long-term memory.\n\nDangers\nHigh quality coupler stabilizes Kolosokâ€™s energy. Using Kolosok without it can fully erase the memory.\n\nUncareful picking from the stem power source brakes the dissasembler and leave a burn on hands.",
