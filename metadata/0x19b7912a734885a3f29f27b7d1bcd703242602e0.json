    "description": "\"Guernica\" is one of Pablo Picasso's most famous and impressive works. This large-scale black-and-white painting depicts an attack on the city of Guernica, which was destroyed by German and Italian air raids in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\"Guernica\" carries a strong political message about the horrors of war and inhuman violence. The painting features dismembered and distorted figures, animals and objects. As people writhe in pain, expressions of helplessness and horror appear on their faces.\n\nPicasso abandoned traditional painting techniques when creating \"Guernica\" and expressed it with hard, sharp lines and abstracted figures. This increased the emotional impact of the work, allowing it to leave a deep impression on the viewers.\n\n\"Guernica\" not only describes an event, but also deals with the horrors of war and inhuman violence in general. Today, the painting has become a symbol of the struggle for peace and human rights.\n\nPicasso's \"Guernica\" is recognised worldwide for its power and influence, both for its importance in art history and for its political message. This painting has gained an important place in the art world with its power to express the destructive effects of war.",
