    "description": "\"Opps\" is a collage art animation music video inspired by a track off of my 2019 \"Shadow Work\" EP. I wrote this song during a trip to Cairo, Egypt, and the visual encompasses the vibe of both the trip and the song itself. I produced the beat, shot the green screen footage in the living room of my apartment, and collage art animated the visual with sourced MP4 and PNG files.",
