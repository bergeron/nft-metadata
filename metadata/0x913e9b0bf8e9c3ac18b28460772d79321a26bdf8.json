    "description": "This is our genesis music NFT and we are excited to debut our lead single \"3AM\" exclusively on Sound. Web3 is the future of our community and is a direct connection between us and our fans.\n\n“3AM” is a Valentine’s dance floor hit for the hopeless romantics that’s helping to redefine the modern love-song with Via’s sultry vocals and melancholy lyrics sitting atop Na’el’s funk and groove laden production.\n\n“3AM” is dedicated to the late-night lovers, the ones who may be ashamed to hold hands in public. To us, this song embodies the feeling of being at a party and wanting someone to ask you to dance so that everybody in the room knows that you are together. It’s also about the experience of being single and watching your friends fall in love, and questioning yourself because of it.",
