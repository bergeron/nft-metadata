    "description": "War always leaves a dark and cold memories even plane crashed didn’t far from the site.\n\nIn 1973 a United States Navy DC plane crashed on the black beach at Sólheimasandur, in the South Coast of Iceland, 1 hour walk from historical site back on WW2.\nI may not live in the world war era, but when I saw this site my body froze, the coldness of the weather ran into my blood.  It was one of the greatest moments in my life.  Not only the object when I capture this site but also the moment and its history.",
