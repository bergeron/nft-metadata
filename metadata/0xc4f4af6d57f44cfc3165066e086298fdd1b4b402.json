Legend has it that one such creature left a fragment of stone somewhere deep within the dunes. A blood red eye said to hold a corrupted power. If you bring me this stone I will exchange it for my finest goblin mercenary. You may take him into your service, and I will take the corruption into mineâ€¦\"",
