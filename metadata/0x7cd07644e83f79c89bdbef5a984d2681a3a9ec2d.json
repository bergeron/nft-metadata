    "description": "\"Artist Point\"  \nArtist: Byron Fichter\n\nYellowstone National Park, the first national park in the US, and widely accepted as the first in the world. When Ulysses S. Grant passed this historic designation on the park, he also preserved one of the most diverse, and majestic landscapes for generations to follow. \nComplete with vast canyons, wildlife, waterfalls, and geothermal features, Yellowstone is impressive in its endless wonder. \nI spent approximately 11 hours at this location, which flew by in minutes. Easily lost in the grandiose of the scene below me. That time would boil down into a fraction of a second when the clouds would break, allowing a ray of sun to glance off the mist, in the wake of the falls below. This moment of eternal erosion, and cosmic light would combine to create a scene of unimaginable beauty. That of which perfectly represents the magic of Yellowstone.",
