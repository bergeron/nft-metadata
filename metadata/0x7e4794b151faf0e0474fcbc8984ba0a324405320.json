    "description": "Superyacht designers Bannenberg and Rowell are led by Dickie Bannenberg and creative director Simon Rowell, and carry the legacy of one of the most famous yacht designers of them all. It was superyacht designer Jon Bannenberg – Dickie’s late father – who is often cited as the father of modern yacht design, and it is a tradition that Dickie and his team continue to this day. Dickie Bannenberg worked alongside his father for 15 years on an array of iconic superyachts, and the current studio still holds a formidable reputation. Rowell joined the team in 2003, and Bannenberg & Rowell yacht designs can be found all over the world.",
