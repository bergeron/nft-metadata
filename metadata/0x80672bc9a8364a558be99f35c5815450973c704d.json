    "description": "Long ago, humans held their place at the top of the food chain. They considered themselves the supreme species on Earth, righteously subjugating all of nature for their own selfish needs. In their pride, the human race believed that nothing could dethrone their rule. But this hubris would blind them to a great existential threat, for lurking in the shadows, animals were studying the human race with envious eyes. The humans were smart. They walked upright. They had advanced technology and weapons. But the animals had learned much from their years of observation, and slowly began to formulate their plans.\n",
