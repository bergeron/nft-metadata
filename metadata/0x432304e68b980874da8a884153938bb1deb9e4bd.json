    "description": "Have you ever met someone that has made you reconsider your beliefs about every emotion in existence?\n\n'One Who Got Away' symbolizes a deeper dilemma that dwells within mankind - Should we express our love whenever we can or hide it deep within us? \n\nThe artwork represents a story of two lovers. Certain about their feelings for the other yet they are a victim of hesitation. What will it be? Will their lives forever drift in isolation or will they muster the courage to accept their feelings for the other? \n\nThe shining outline represents what will be if they take a moment to tell the other that they love them. The lives will be eternally intertwined and they shall have the life they have desired. That fated moment is represented by the sparks that fly when the feelings are reciprocated. \nAll that fear and anxiety, maybe it was worth it all?\n\nTell them that you love them. You never know when it might be too late.\n\nCreated in: Procreate\nAnimation in: After Effects\nResolution: 3000 x 3000",
