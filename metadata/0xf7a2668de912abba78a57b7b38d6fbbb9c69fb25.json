    "description": "\n“Birth of consciousness” investigates the inner self of the viwer. It is a mirror between them and their own realization, self awareness that they are God’s image and thus, a God themselves. \n\nThe main subject has a connection with the world above, to it’s higher state of being through a beam of light becoming inspired, empowered and aware of its own flesh, sould and mind.\n\nIt is taught to us that we are fragile creatures, circling and wandering the land, the waters and the sky in search for greatness, riches and love, but that journey forms a stronger being, and it ends where it began, with the being itself.\n\nWhen we realize we are more that our thoughts, more than our bodies and heart beats, we will be able to step out, step into a new state of mind and awareness.\n\nHand drawn in Photoshop.\n\nAnimated in After Effects.\n\nMusic: Bleach Boy Beats\n",
