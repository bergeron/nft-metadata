    "description": "Like the interior decorating of any house, Clothes on each rope  are a representative of their consumers.\nThe clothes are our molds. \nEven if we chose nakedness, the last thing we wore was our mold.\nClothes have something to cover.\nOr perhaps something is trying to be sheltered under the clothes.\nHere in the most timeless and placeless space in the world someone has hanged some clothes; A place where people always wear white.
