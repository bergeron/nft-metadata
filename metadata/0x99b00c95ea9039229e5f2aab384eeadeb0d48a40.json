    "description": "Throughout the latter part of the 20th Century until today, international borders have become an area of conflict, with issues ranging from illegal migration, drug smuggling, violence, prostitution, etc. The social cost as well as the economic implications of these border regions has resulted in an almost single-themed conversation on the subject. The Frontera project aims to propose a different approach towards a new interpretation of the Mexico – US territorial border. Its purpose is to generate an alternative visual discourse which will challenge the prolonged conversation about borders and which aims to open up a new dialogue closer to an idea of collective self-understanding.\n\nEdition: 1 of 1",
