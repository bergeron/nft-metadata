    "description": "When I looked back my past, I saw myself through my arts. I realized that I have done many artworks that I like. My brain has been filled with art things. I glad that I have persevered, entangled with beautiful communities, have connection with many amazing artists. Many inspirations, colors and strokes. This is my dream since I was little kid, to be an artist.\n\nThis art was made by digital art painting, acrylic, tissue paper and wild dry flower.\nArt Size 2000 x 2500 px\n",
