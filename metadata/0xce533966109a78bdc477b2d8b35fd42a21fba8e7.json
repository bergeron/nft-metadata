    "description": "The Ocean is a magic that I love deeply. I love living by it and its regulating and invigorating effect. It is nature at its most palpable. Vast·blue·beautiful·powerful·ever-changing. I was messaging a friend on one of my ocean walks, they were having a hard time, and I’d wished there was some way I could transport her, so she too could gaze out into that vast indigo sea with the salt air in her lungs. So I told my DALL·E all about the Big Blue, and its many ways of being. ‘INDIGO DAZE’ is a collection that brings my ocean to you. Love Georgina × DALL·E",
