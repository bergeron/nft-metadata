    "description": "This is me trying something new. \nA song about not appearing to have human emotions.\nI started making a lot of videos in which I tell stories on TikTok\nIncluding this song. A few weeks and viral videos later I'm feeding \ninto the anticipation built up around this song.\nWhat better way to do it than dropping it on Web3 first?\n\nPutting on my Mongolian fishing boots and I'm getting to these rare fish.\niykyk\n\nProduced, written, recorded, Mixed & Mastered by Luca Maxim",
