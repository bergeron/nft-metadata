    "description": "\"THIS IS THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT\" by Daniel Gebhart de Koekkoek is part of the exhibition ALGORITHMIC EMPATHY. THE PROMISES OF AI, presented by EXPANDED.ART and VerticalCrypto Art at EXPANDED.ART in Berlin, 18-23 April, 2023.\n\n16 artists explore the vast potential of future relationships between AI and creative expression to hypothesize on the not-so-distant future.\n\nIn a world where technological advancements happen in the blink of an eye, AI is being pointed to in the cultural zeitgeist as an example of a potentially bleak and ominous future. It is worth considering, however, the ways computers and machine learning can push forward creativity, human connection and philosophical dialogues.",
