    "description": "There are many thoughts swirling in my head. I try not to let them out and it's getting harder and harder to do it hour by hour. Sometimes I think my head is going to explode from everything that's going on.\n...\nUnfortunately, I can't control everything that happens. People cannot stop a lightning strike or a thunderclap. We try to remain calm, but the hurricane inside us breaks out. The time will come and I will release his consciousness.\n...\nBRAIN STORM.\nCollection \"New Era\" 3\\10\nNFT consists of 2 pictures 420 x 594 mm.\nDrawn by hand. Used black ink, watercolors.",
