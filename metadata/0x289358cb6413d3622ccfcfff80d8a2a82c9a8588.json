    "description": "\"output 1\" is the first piece out of the \"TL;DR: the human race was a kind of bacteria that flourished in the electronic ether;\" digital project, commissioned by the art platform \"As We Leave The Window Open\", initiated as part of Liste Expedition. \n\nIt was produced by the new media artist fictionofmatter with the assistance of two artificial intelligence models: GPT-3 and VQGAN. It comprises an exercise in cybernetics that seeks to probe into the more liminal yet hallucinatory outputs generated by human-machine interaction. \n\nDrawing from open-world game aesthetics, the history of modern painting, critical theory, psychedelic and consumer culture tropes alike, it points to a mapping out of an incipient hybrid space that both connects and counterpoints the neural net and the human mind in particularly composite ways.\n\nLink [https://preview-offspace.netlify.app/preview-vinicius-duarte](https://preview-offspace.netlify.app/preview-vinicius-duarte) .",
