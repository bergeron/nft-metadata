    "description": "It was a beautiful day in the state of Oklahoma. I had been driving countless hours through Route 66 as I was making my way to New York. No responsibilities to worry about for a few days, windows down while blasting to music and taking as many photographs as I could. It was a really fun road trip that I would never forget.\n\nArtist: JennVisuals\n\nLimited Edition of 10.\n\nLicense: NFT holder is free to use on social media, private display, and in virtual galleries, as long as the creator is credited.
