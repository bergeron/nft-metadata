    "description": "Viṣṇu is all-pervasive and omnipresent. Viṣṇu is a deity in Hindu mythology who is considered one of the three main deities along with Brahma and Shiva. He is depicted as the protector and preserver of the world. \n\nIn Hindu iconography, Viṣṇu is typically depicted in one of his incarnations as a four-armed human figure with blue or black skin, wearing yellow clothing. In his four hands, he holds four attributes: a lotus flower, a club, a conch shell, and a chakra (in the form of a disc or spiral).",
