    "description": "The photo was a self-portrait clicked in 2012. I was trying to escape the never-ending questions in my head that I couldn't figure out the answers to. \nTwo photos overlayed resulted in something that I could connect from my soul. The urge to \"set me free\".\n\nAfter 10 years I find myself in a similar situation. \nIn desperation and hope! \n\nDedicated to the importance of Mental Health.\n\n",
