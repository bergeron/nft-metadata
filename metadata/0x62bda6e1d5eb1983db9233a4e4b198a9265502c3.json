    "description": "Pioneer is a project designed and dedicated to us, web3 pioneers, creators and builders of this incredible space, which unites and sometimes divides. Which makes us frustrated but sometimes happy. I imagined each of us as a solitary astronaut who, traveling in the immensity of this space, finds his place where to build his little house. Each of us, a single person, but who all together create a community. The pioneer community.\n\nEach work was created using AI software combined in several parts so as to make images customizable.\n\nCustomized work for Gelo_Arch: if one day Gelo goes to mars, he would surely build a skyscraper.",
