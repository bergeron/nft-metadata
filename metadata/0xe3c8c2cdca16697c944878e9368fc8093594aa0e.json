    "description": "How beautiful the people's hearts\nHow unabsurd the madness\nHow free the bird, how at peace the tree\nWords cannot convey the awe and majesty\nFeeling the beauty of nature\nI can but kneel in wonder at exultant diversity\nAnd feel, not trying to understand\nI can but let my eyes leak\nProclaiming the joy and the pain\nJust being the beauty of nature\nFeeling the beauty of the heart of the trees\nFeeling the deeper connections\nAnd love the nature in my heart\nAnd live the poetry\nFeeling the beauty of nature\nAs the river flows my heart is flowing too\nThe bounteous gifts we receive with love\nThe blessing are all here\nWe must look after them\nSeeing the beauty of nature.\n\nArtist:sunzilla \nPoetry:Durand",
