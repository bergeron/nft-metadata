    "description": "Academy of Fine AI Arts - Year 3039 \nIt is the present future, a lesson of AI Art is given to that humanity that has stopped teaching to learn what it does not know about itself. Much has happened since the last time it was observed, but its reflection on the canvas describes the interior that cannot be seen in the eyes it carries. Existence now becomes present and narrates the environment, the reality in which lives. The same reality of which we are a part.\n\ntattoos, graffiti and the sketch on the canvas are a collab with the AI \"Midjourney\" produced one by one with the AI under my descriptions and then intervened and integrated with PSD to the piece.",
