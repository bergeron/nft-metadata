    "description": "In the heart of the artist, a fire burns bright  \nFueled by passion and the will to create  \nBut when the world fails to see the light  \nThe pain of unsold art is hard to mitigate\n\nLike a tree that bears no fruit  \nThe artist feels the emptiness and hollowness  \nFor art is not a means to earn, but a pursuit  \nYet it's hard to ignore the material success\n\nBut as Rumi says,  \n\"The wound is the place where the light enters you\"  \nPerhaps in this pain, lies a deeper truth  \nFor the artist, it's not fame or wealth  \nBut the joy of creation that holds the proof\n\nSo let the artist create, with an open heart  \nFor the beauty of art, will never depart  \nIt will find its way to the right eyes  \nAnd the artist will be forever immortalized.",
