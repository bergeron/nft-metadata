    "description": "This is the first piece of the three that form the collection and it is called “Love: Leave/Stay”.\n\n\"Balloons” is a collection of three 3-dimensional artworks. Each piece is an inflatable balloon sculpture floating and hovering in the digital space with 3 different words concealed in itself to discover by orbiting the model. The words have a specific meaning that is reflected by the look of the balloon itself and they are connected to each other in the way that one word is always the “input” and the other 2 words are the different choices that one can make given that input. This idea is to represent the two different forces that pull us in opposite directions every time we have to make a decision at a given moment. Those forces coexist in all of us like two faces of the same coin and the choices we have to make are often determined not only by our character but also by our current state of mind.",
