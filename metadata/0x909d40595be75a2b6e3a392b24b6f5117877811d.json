Together, they represent different facets of music, from its roots to the various forms it has taken today. \n\nThe use of recycled glass and Abalo's special resin mixture in each unic piece demonstrates his commitment to sustainability and the environment. Each work is an artistic representation of the culture and music of the specific genre it represents, using colors, textures, and designs that evoke the unique history and spirituality of each musical genre.\n\nThrough this series, Abalo can showcase the diversity and richness of music, from its roots to the many branches it has grown over time. Each luminous relief is a vibrant and beautiful expression of a different aspect of music, inspiring those who seek a deeper understanding of the power of music in our lives.\n\nVidroresin Relief 41 x 46 x 8",
