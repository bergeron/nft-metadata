    "description": "While walking the alleys of the historical center of Athens, you can witness except the ruins and the great architecture that ancient Greeks had, music coming from different directions…\n\nThis wonderful man with this great energy sitting in one of the most remote and quiet alleys in Plaka, downtown Athens, playing his guitar while being in a flow state, was captivating. He was different than most street musicians I’ve ever met. Distractions didn’t have any effect on him and were keeping doing what he love; not that many people were passing by from this spot. Had to take the shot before his music drifted me even more to his emotional state, his flow state.",
