    "description": "Sometimes it seems that now is the worst time in our life. I realized that this feeling is often with me. In some things everything even is better now. Just problems exist with us all time. They are just different. When we go through them we become stronger. \nWe just have to be in balance between sadness and happiness all time. It is normal to be between both of these feelings. \n\nTechnique: Procreate\nSize: 3000x4300, 600dpi\nRGB"
