    "description": "I got stuck on the side of the highway with a flat tire while my sister was driving us. We ended up trying to wave somebody down not because we didn't know how to change a tire but we didn't have the right sized wrench in the car. Two people stopped... but they didn't have the right size either. Most people just drove by... I wish we lived in a world where more people would just stop and help... but one of the people told us they were scared.. I guess times are changing... ",
