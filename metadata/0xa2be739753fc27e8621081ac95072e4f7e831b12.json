    "description": "On January 20th 2017, I had the sudden urge to escape. That night, I got in my car, picked up my friends, and drove straight to our spot : THE GLADES. The sky that night was beautiful, completely isolated in the swamp, not one noise... While I was taking photos, a friend of mine turned his phone flash on. In Complete darkness, the shutter button was ready.\n\n1/1",
