    "description": "The Hug from the Human Dilatations series. Video Full HD, 1920x1420px, col. 00:01:00\n\nHuman Dilations NFT series is an anatomical journey of human bodies in ultra-high definition, extracted from the homonym physical art series.\n\nHuman Dilatations is a glimpse of the lack the contemporary human being, bared of the two elements that distinguish his quest: the physical perfection and the actual power/role of the mind. Each image represents a body whose proportions are partially distorted and prevails over a head that dissolves, leaving only few traces of their initial recognisability.\n\n",
