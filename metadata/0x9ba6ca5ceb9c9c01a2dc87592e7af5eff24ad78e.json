    "description": "This work combine several elements from historical painting into one beautiful collage work. \nOne of them is a painting from Evelyn De Morgan 1880\n\n\"The theme of death was an increasingly common theme in Evelyn’s oeuvre as time went by. The Angel of Death I is the most overt representation of the subject and demonstrates Evelyn’s spiritualist belief that death is to be welcomed and not feared.\nEvelyn depicts the Angel of Death, who is symbolised by his grey hair and scythe, as a beautiful and benign figure, gently comforting the frail female figure he has in his sight. The young woman appears to have had a hard life - signified by the arid landscape behind her. In contrast the way forward is illustrated with a fertile landscape and spring flowers, demonstrating Evelyn’s view that the path of the Angel of Death is not to be feared.\"",
