    "name": "Her Grief",
    "description": "While the world has changed, many of her initial thoughts are still present today because it's difficult to let go of \"what could have been.\" Her strongest grief is no longer a part of who she is but one day it was all she knew. Her heart is torn asunder. In a moment and for eternity, it has crumbled down. The negative space that remains leaves her with nothing to hold onto; she hurls herself at the wall like a brick crashing into concrete. She wants to feel it too. She needs to feel the roughness of reality, caress the sandpaper coarse walls of grief and walk through the muck.",
