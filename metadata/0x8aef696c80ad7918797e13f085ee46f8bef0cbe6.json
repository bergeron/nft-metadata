    "description": "Living a slow-paced life can be quite frustrating at times. It feels like everything moves slowly and we are always stuck on the same page. But to see life from a slower perspective is to see the beauty in nature and the time it takes for things to happen.\n\nSeasons come and go, giving way to new beginnings and endings, life always manages to keep moving forward. It is also a reminder that life is never too short or too long, it just moves at its own pace.\n\nHachimi (2023)",
