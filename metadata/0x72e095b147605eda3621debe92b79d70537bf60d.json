    "description": "“Born with graceful wings and soft red feathers, she has become a creature that does not know how to fly. The wind, jealous of her freedom, carried away her feathers and dispersed them across the sky long ago. She no longer bares her soul to the skies but sits and waits for a gentle breeze to stir her memory.”\n\n— bird no. 03, Birds of Paradise\n\nBirthed from the buried dreams of artificial intelligence, the Birds of Paradise live between the objective truths defined by written and spoken canon and the subjective truths of invisible, unwritten histories. The series emerges from a recursive conversation with AI that excavates the lore ingrained within a collective consciousness and probes the boundaries of memory for a point of origin. Each bird perches lightly on the multiplicity and reimagining of truth, questioning the conditioning of a past that would continue to shape a present reality.",
