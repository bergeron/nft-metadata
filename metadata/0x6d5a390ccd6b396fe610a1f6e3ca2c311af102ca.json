    "description": "little frail!\" Su Han heart murmured.\n\n\n\nHe could feel the broken meridians in his body. These meridians were all the meridians of the martial arts. Although they were broken, they did not affect the body and limbs.\n\n\n\n\"But in retrospect, was not my body so weak when I began my practice, eons and eons ago?\"\n\n\n\n\"In my last life, I could step upon thousands of bones and sweep the world to rule the holy land. In this life, I can do the same!\"\n\n\n\nGently exhaled breath, Su Han cross-knee and sit, eyes slightly closed, the mind emerged a method.",
