    "description": "Hey guys it’s SLOE JACK. I’m stoked to be back on Sound to premiere my upcoming track, “LOCUST”.\n\n\"LOCUST\" is about courage, strength and bravery in dark circumstances. The lyrics describe the struggles and challenges that must be faced and overcome to achieve personal growth and fulfilment. The metaphor of a locust represents the journey from a hopeless existence to a life of purpose. This track is my personal favourite out of all my upcoming releases.\n\nThanks Sound for welcoming me back to their platform. I am so thankful for the opportunity!",
