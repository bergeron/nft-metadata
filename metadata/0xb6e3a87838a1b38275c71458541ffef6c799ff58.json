    "description": "This work was created spontaneously, without a pre-established concept. Despite this, the result ended up becoming a real reflection of my inner state at the time of painting. In the end, this piece represents a personal celebration of the imperfections and the unexpected positive events of life and above all, it is a package of raw human energy. The entire work was hand-painted using 2D painting software.",
