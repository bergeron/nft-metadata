    "description": "The Apple 512k is my Gairden of Eden as an artist collaborating with a computer.\n\nSome of my earliest memories around creation involve me using Mac Paint or drawing on paper in a notebook.\n\nI would doodle an idea digitally, print it out on the dot matrix printer and then draw on the printout with whatever medium I had laying around.\n\nThis piece represents my present skillset and capabilities with Ai using the tooling of 2023.\n\nThe sound you are hearing is me typing a couple paragraphs of instructions from the original MacPaint manual: \n\n\"How to begin:\n• Insert the MacPaint disk.\n• Open a MacPaint document by clicking the Paint disk icon and choosing \"Open\" from the \"File\" menu, then clicking the MacPaint icon and choosing \"Open\" again.\nIn a few seconds, the screen will look like this:\"\n\nThis is where I leave you, enjoy. This is a piece of me and my artistic journey.",
