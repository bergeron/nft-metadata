    "name": "The Equilibrium",
    "description": "The “Equilibrium” represents a vèvè of Erzulie Freda, a respected goddess who reigns over love and refinement. The painting is a mixture of several opposing colors which together reflect a work of art. It considers all aspects of life: relationships, work, health, emotions but also differences between species including humans in a world in constant balance. Despite the differences in life, together we are a whole, a perfection in love. Moreover, united, vèvè forms a heart which, separated, would break the perfection of life.\n\nAbout Ferlando:\nFerlando is a self taught artist since 1993. His style has evolved over time. From a comic book designer, his artistic bent tends towards his spiritual origins and respect for Mother Nature. ",
