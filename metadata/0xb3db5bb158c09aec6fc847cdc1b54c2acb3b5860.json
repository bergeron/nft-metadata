    "description": "Observe GAN-generated human being is morphed in and out of the matrix. Please keep quiet, it is very shy.\n\n>sh gmi\n\nA single command unwraps hundreds lines of code that brings into existence weird and glitchy creatures, visions and dreams. To bring them about I use my 15+ years of experience in digital media and coding. All gmi.sh works are generated by bash scripts with no third-party premade materials used. \n\nAlgorithmically determined computer-generated art (synthetic media) is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases, the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.",
