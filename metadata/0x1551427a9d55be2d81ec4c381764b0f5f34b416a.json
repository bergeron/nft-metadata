    "description": "by Hulki Okan Tabak, 1/1 minted on it WAS yesterday, 2022\n\nit WAS yesterday is my experimental playground where I can take risks but I don't have to.. Where I dump ideas and then get dumped by them.. Where I overanalyze, oversympathize, overemphasize and overempathize.. Then go under and survive to fight, to think, to love, to create, to talk another day.",
