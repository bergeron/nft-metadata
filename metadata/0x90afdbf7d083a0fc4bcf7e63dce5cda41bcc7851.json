    "description": "The first work of the collection was prepared based on the habits of Victor Hugo.\n\nIt is said that Victor Hugo drinks raw eggs and takes a shower with iced water to keep his mind and body young, therefore believing that he could write more efficiently.\n\nSince Medieval Europe is mentioned in detail in the author's books, Paris was chosen as the background.\n\nThe composition has been made by the light of these unique elements.",
