    "description": "The same person who told you that you can be anything in this world... might end up being the one to tell you that it's unrealistic when you figure out what that is. To be such a light in this dark world takes courage! Once you see who is making all these rules, you might not feel so bad about bending them. The other side is calmer than you think once the storm passes. Although our horse blinders tend to be on most days, never forget the gifts that you hold within and the power that your love has. Move with grace, set intentions and the sunny side of the street will be at your feet!",
