    "description": "The sunshine has a pleasant way\nOf shining on us all the day,\nIt makes the little window bright,\nAnd fills the room with pretty light.\n\nWe were in a house under construction. The sun was coming through a little roof window. I used strips of tape to form these shadow lines. Melissa laid down on this white sheet that was there to protect the floor from paint. I told her what pose to take and triggered the camera.\n\n40x60cm Fine Art print and signed version may be requested for the collector.",
