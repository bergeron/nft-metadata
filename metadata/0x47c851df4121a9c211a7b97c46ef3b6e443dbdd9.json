    "description": "Original artwork - Oil on wrapped canvas  36\" x 36\"\n\n2020 was a hard year for nearly everyone on planet Earth. My wife, Amy, and I came up with the #time2unite2020 challenge. Its purpose was to do something kind for a random person. Even though it didn't reach viral-share levels, it helped us remember that service to others is a key element to the pack mentality. We all need to remember we're on the same team. Let's work to unite.\n\nDone in an open impressionist or pointillist style, this exotic animal was painted in bold, split-compliment color schemes and high contrasting value scales. The \"shattering\" effect as I often refer to it, adds energy to the spaces and helps transition shapes and perceived lines.",
