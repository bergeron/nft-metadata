    "description": "This Meta Card gives its owner early access to features in the book games tool: bookgamestool.eth. The art for each card was created by Karl Cross as he imagined bringing each book games strategy to life \n\n The Hold strategy is for those with diamond hands and a good sense for high value tokens. The style of this minted card is a reminder that patience comes from understanding the value of what you have without regard for the noise (positive or negative).",
