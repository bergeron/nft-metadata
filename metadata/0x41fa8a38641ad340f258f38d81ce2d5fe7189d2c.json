    "description": "A lovely smile of mine. A flower I received this morning. It smells so good, feels soft on my lungs, laying deep on my heart. And let it bloom, be endless spring season in this barren heart.  \nShiny red crystal. Light and fragile. As it crack a little bit, all just perished into dust, and may hurt all around it.  \nNo lands to stand on, no wings to flap. Guess who fell into the deep blue again. I have to face the water to find out.",
