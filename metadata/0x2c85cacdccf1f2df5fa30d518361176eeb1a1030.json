    "name": "Vulcanus",
    "description": "Vulcanus is a powerful and imposing figure, standing tall and broad-shouldered. He wears heavy armor and wields a massive hammer, which he uses to shape the earth and forge powerful weapons. His skin is a deep red, as if he has been tempered by the fires of the forge, and his eyes blaze with a fierce intensity. Despite his fearsome appearance, Vulcanus is a wise and just ruler, respected by all who serve him.",
