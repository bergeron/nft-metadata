    "description": "- Created by Serkan TEKIN\n- 1/1 Edition\n- Taken in Bakirkoy/Istanbul - 01/03/2017\n- 4594x2584\n-300 dpi\n\nAstral travel or projection is when your soul leaves your body while alive and goes to another place. It is a term used in esotericism to describe an intentional out-of-body experience \n\nThis photo was taken on the coastal road in a foggy weather. When I saw the statue on the beach and the gloomy landscape, this thought came to my mind and I waited for someone to pass by. It is as if the consciousness separated from the statue is walking in search in a misty world. It's like the journey has come to an end and it's back to its essence.\n",
