    "description": "Welcome to PIN002.\n\nEvery month I will be going to a new location with a friend and making a song with them. \n\nWhatever demo we have at the end of the trip will be minted on Sound, along with other activations across Web3. No additional edits, no overthinking. Just making music and throwing it up for the world to judge. I've always wanted to drop songs at the same time that the NFT drops and this is my way of taking steps in that direction.\n\nFor the second episode I went to Ojai with DLG. where we were graciously hosted by Sojai studios. We made a few records but Cage was the first one we did and it was the one that ended up sticking the most. The song has a lot to do with a conversation we had on the drive up where we talked about the necessity of restrictions when it comes to creativity.",
