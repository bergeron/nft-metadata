    "description": "This piece is about how the words that are said to us can shape us especially when we are younger. If there are kind words said to us that can be a reflection of how we treat others. If you are surrounded by unkind people you tend to assume that all people are that way and you act in the way you know. This piece is a representation of being treated as if you were evil so then you are shaped as such.",
