    "description": "3000x3641px\n\nI painted this artwork at a turning point in my life, it seems fitting for her to be my first NFT art. At that point of my life, I kept repeating this phrase in my mind, \"It doesn't matter if you fall down nine times, as long as you get back up ten times.\" I want to show her scarred, bloody but she still rises, with a fierce smile on her face, the tiger is her determination and fierceness incarnate. \n\nTo a better life, to a better Self. \n\nI hope wherever, to whomever this piece ends up with, she can bring you the same courage and support as she did with with me <3 \n\nLove,\nE V ÆŽ",
