    "description": "The citizens that came to stay in Dragon City has been forged by magma and dragon fire, their skin turning into a shade of stone and ash. Little by little they learned how to find the beauty in midst of danger. \n\nThe world hasn't had it easy last few years. It made me want to draw strong people, who could persevere.\n\nThank you to my community who decided to lend me their person to be included in this artwork!"
