    "description": "In the ongoing CrypToadz lore, Evil King GREMPLIN has been imprisoned! In a weeks-long battle, Colonel Floorbin and the Lil Toadz pressed the king back into one of his choglat storage caves.\n\nThough well guarded, the Lil Toadz with their special skills were too much for The Fronkz guarding the cave. Mouth dripping with choglat, GREMPLIN was cuffed and dragged from the hideaway. Now, the CrypToadz want ALL of their choglat back!\n\nTo be continued...this piece (series 1.01) is one of many in the works, which WILL be released over the next few weeks, and they MAY or MAY NOT be relevant later.",
