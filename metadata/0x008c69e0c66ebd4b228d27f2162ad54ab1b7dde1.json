The league is creating a new model of ownership by leveraging blockchain technology to sell NFTs that represent ownership-like value in its twelve teams. All editions include voting rights towards team actions, priceless gameday experiences and VIP tickets to all games, and limited-edition team, league, and championship merchandise and memorabilia. Fire editions also include exclusive intellectual property and licensing rights to team names, logos, and merchandise as well as additional gameday activations.",
