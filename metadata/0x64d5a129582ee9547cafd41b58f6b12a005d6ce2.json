    "description": "*/ \"all that glitters\", is very personal and unique for various reasons. \nit has many references/easter eggs all over the artwork from fashion and music culture that inspired me and led me to where i'm now like Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, Heaven by Marc Jacobs, Chrome Hearts, Aphex Twin, Sanrio, and so on.\n\n the skeleton is holding a Tamagotchi with an eye on the screen that represents the hidden \"more alive than ever\" feeling of the skeleton._\n\nthis piece took me around 2 months to be finished and was made using only a default round brush as a form of personal challenge.",
