    "description": "The Papiliosson brothers' mother often told them that their birth was not vaginal. According to her, they came into the world from the enormous pupa that their uncle-to-be hung from the garage ceiling. Where he found it he never told. But probably in the fantastic dreamland where  beautiful, kind-hearted, two-headed human butterflies live. \n\nThat's the story that shaped the lives of the Papiliosson brothers, and the origin of all the otherworldly beauty they managed to spread across the world before the terrible tragedy of February 23, 1989.\n\nimage size: 4096Ã—4096px / file format: PNG / file size: 805 kB",
