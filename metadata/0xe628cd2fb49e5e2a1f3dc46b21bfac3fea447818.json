    "description": "One day, when the girl Kiki fell asleep, she had a very strange dream. Everything was so unusual there... The trees are alive, you can see ghosts, there were bugs instead of earrings, and the buildings were able to talk. Although they were a little scary, Kiki was not afraid of them at all and really wanted to return to this strange world again",
