    "description": "What \"Dried flowers\" can teach us.\n\nAnimals including people are able to move, but there are many sterile conflicts. \nBecause plants are immobile, they use different survival strategies from animals. \n\nDried flowers are freed from their original need for \"air\" and \"strife\", and their final appearance fascinates people.\nI don't know myself whether it is a living thing or a corpse.\n\nAll NFTs are made with real dried flowers and glass shoes, which are most beautiful at the moment of completion and slowly wither and decay afterwards.\nI use the life of the plant to create artworks, and it is my mission to photograph these beautiful moments.",
