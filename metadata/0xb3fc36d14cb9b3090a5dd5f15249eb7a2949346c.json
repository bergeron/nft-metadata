    "description": "The brain's electrical activity sparks billions of connections within our neural pathway. Creating the bridge between code and our brain's functionality is a fascinating idea which relates on an extremely relative scale. The processes our brains execute without complete conscious guidance relate to the way code writes without the need for complete physical interaction. Grids further explores my fascination with connectivity, drawing inspiration from the format of large city grids. Urban grids have a directional chaos characteristic and streets are often oriented towards true north, sometimes magnetic north. I wanted to convey the theme of chaos deep into the outputs of Grids, as well as imprint the billions of connections our neural pathway births while still pertaining a sense of organization. Organized chaos. Placing thousands of agents drawing into a seemingly organized canvas, following the principles of a flow field, each output portrays a populous grid.",
