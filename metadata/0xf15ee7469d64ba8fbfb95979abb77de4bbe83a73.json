    "description": "The Secret Tsuka Society awards the Tsuka Honor Medals to those holders who witnessed the awakening of the sleeping dragon. These medals are made of different materials and are limited in their quantity. The Secret Tsuka Society believes that the Great Dragon will flyhigh and bring prosperity and peace.\n\nThe original Tsuka honor medals always have the ETH address of the Secret Tsuka Society and the contract address of the Dejitaru Tsuka himself on their surface. In addition, original Tsuka Medals of Honor are always and only distributed in rotating animations that slowly rotate around the medal itself. This makes it difficult for counterfeiters to distribute copies of the medal of honor and makes it easy to distinguish Tsuka medals of honor from counterfeits.\n\nThe Tsuka honor medals come in different editions. Platinum is the most limited and valuable edition with 25 editions. Followed by the Gold Edition which covers a larger availability of editions with 250, Silver with 500 editions and Bronze with 2500 editions. Additionally, the Secret Tsuka Society mints other very limited special editions from time to time.\n\nThe Secret Tsuka society is trying to create more variety around the Dejitaru Tsuka and has the goal of raising visibility for the great dragon and spreading the message of its arrival.\n\nExpects the dragon ~The Secret Tsuka Society (@TsukaSociety)",
