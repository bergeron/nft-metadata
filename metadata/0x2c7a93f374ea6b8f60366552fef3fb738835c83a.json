    "name": "The Wabi Space ",
    "description": "This canvas was inspired and designed by the wabi style philosophy aesthetics using roughness and natural material with modern furniture. The idea also was to combine wabi style with the deep tones and lighting mood like in the art of Caravaggio, Orazio Gentileschi, Artemisia Gentileschi and other greatest Italian artists.\n\nBuying this canvas you support the artist and inspire him to continue creating more products like this.
