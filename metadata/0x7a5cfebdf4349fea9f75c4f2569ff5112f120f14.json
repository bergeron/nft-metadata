    "description": "Perhaps the most famous of the seeing priests - or Augurs, as they preferred to be called. Like the rest of his kind, he appeared shortly after the plague arrived. Roaming the countryside in tattered robes, and offering the village folk protection from the plague. In exchange for this service, Agmund asked that the villagers open their homes to the vermin that sought shelter from the cold. They were to lay out food and drink, and share the warmth of their hearths with the rats that soon came after his visits. \n\nIt was said that the villages that accepted his offer somehow managed to hide from the plague. As their neighbours were rotting in the wake of her visits, these rat infested villages seemed to stay untouched. \n",
