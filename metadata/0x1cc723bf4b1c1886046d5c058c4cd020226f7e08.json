    "description": "During the 2022 94th Oscar telecast Chris Rock and Will Smith had an altercation.\n\nRock appeared on stage to present the Oscar for documentary feature and made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith being in “G.I. Jane” because of her shaved head. \n\nSmith then took the stage to slap Rock. Although it appeared to be a joke at first, Smith returned to his seat and yelled at Rock, \n\n“Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!”\n\n\nThe holder of this Nft will help to keep hope and respect in this world.\n\nHonor on you.",
