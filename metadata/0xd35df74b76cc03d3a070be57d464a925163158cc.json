She died three days later while still in police custody.\n\nProtests erupted across Iran after news of the heinous incident broke (thanks in part to reporters Niloofar Hamedi and Elahe Mohammadi, who have since been imprisoned by the Iranian regime). Women led them, ripping off their hijabs, cutting their hair, and chanting \"women, life, freedom.\"\n",
