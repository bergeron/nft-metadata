    "description": "This artwork is created by a 3 year-old girl, SANA, and colored by SANA with her pure, fun, energetic, innocent and yet unintentional mind. \n\nNo one can make anything the same as or similar to this, even SANA herself. She keeps growing up and will gradually expose herself to the society, which makes it hard for her to retain this status of mind. \n\nPhysical-wise and time-wise, This artwork is her “one and only” , so I titled this “Purple Diamond”.\n\nPixel Dimension: 10000 × 7084px\nResolution: 300 dpi",
