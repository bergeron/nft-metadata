    "description": "We often hyper-focus, be engulfed by daily life and the grind. If we let this take over we will succumb to various elements draining our energy, our sanity.\n\nAnywhere you may be, just don't forget to take a moment - absorb what's in your surroundings. You just might catch a glimpse of something that will either brighten your day or change your day.\n\nIf you look at the right time you just might catch something like this (but in color obvs).",
