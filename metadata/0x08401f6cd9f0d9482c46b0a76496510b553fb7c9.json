    "description": "Forest Melodies\n\nIn the midst of the dense forest, a lonely piano stands, overgrown with moss and surrounded by nature. It almost seems as if the piano has always been there, as if it has become a part of the landscape. The scattered music notes on the ground tell stories of past melodies that were once played here. The forest seems to have taken the piano under its protection. The harmony between nature and music is tangible here and makes us forget that there is a world outside this idyllic environment.",
