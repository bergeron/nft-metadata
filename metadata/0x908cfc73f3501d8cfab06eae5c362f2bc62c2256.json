    "description": "If you ever wondered what could have happened in the room where Gauguin and Van Gogh had their famous argument, when their demons were set free, then this could be the vision shown in this Neo-expressionist painting : raw imagery of tribal themes and action, contrasting with the apparent calm of the room; What has been going on? We wonder and can't help but imagine the night before.",
