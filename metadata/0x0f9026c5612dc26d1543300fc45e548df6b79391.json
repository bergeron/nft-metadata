    "description": "This NFT Collection is inspired by Elon Musk and his SpaceX Team of brilliant engineers and scientists. The project is called \"Mars & Beyond\" the road to making humanity multi-planetary.\n\nMars is an excellent place to study because it is the most similar planet to Earth in the Solar System. It is far away but still within reach. Mars was once full of water with a thicker atmosphere offering an inhospitable but perhaps habitable environment.\n\nWhile we must focus on the many problems we face here on Earth, having a bolder vision, Mars, is exciting and significant. \n\nWe must work to extend consciousness to the stars and understand the Universe.\n\nJoin us at Milky Way Art in celebrating and saluting Project Mars & Beyond.\n\n\"You want to wake up in the morning and  \nthink the future is going to be great - and  \nthat's what being a spacefaring civilization  \nis all about. It's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can't think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.\"\n\n- Elon Musk  \n ",
