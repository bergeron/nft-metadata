    "description": "Artist: Maurits Kool  \nEditions piece: Love in a hopeless place\n\nWalking around in an industrial area looking for interesting structures, lines and building. All we were greeted by was cold concrete, steal and lonely open spaces with white steal pillars. Among them was this one pillar with a bleeding heart on glowing in the light. Just like a beacon of love in a hopeless place. We all search love and happiness in life and sometime life can feel cold and lonely, just like this industrial area. But remember, there love can be found anywhere. So keep looking and who knows, you might find love in a hopeless place!\n\nMuch love MJK\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use for private display and in groups including virtual galleries.
