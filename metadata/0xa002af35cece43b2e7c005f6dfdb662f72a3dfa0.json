As we try to understand our place in the universe, art can be an important part of the dialogue we can create and share with each other. In my work, I seek to reveal the mysterious with arcane imagery and techniques that make sense to me on a deep level that words cannot quantify. There is an underlying dichotomy of the power of technology and our quantum connection to our Universe. How might our use or misuse of technology permanently alter the future of humanity, and what is our personal responsibility for our effect on the world and on each other? It is my attempt to capture the complexity and beauty of the underlying mechanisms that bind us in an emotion.\" - Diaz\n",
