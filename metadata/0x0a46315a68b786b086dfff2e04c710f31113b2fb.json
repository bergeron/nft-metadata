    "description": "“Alec Empire - The Jaguar” \nall tracks were written, recorded and produced by Alec Empire between 93-96 \n\nmastered by The Hellish Vortex, Berlin 2023 \n\nvisual art by The Hellish Vortex \ncover art by Nic Endo \n\nThe Jaguar was an alias that Alec Empire used for 3 years (93-96)  \nwhen he was active in the early techno underground scene. \n\nSome vinyl records were released, often as smaller quantity white labels and none of those ever made it to CD or mp3. \n\nAlec always did his own dub plates that only he would use in his DJ sets at warehouse parties or for (often illegal) outdoor raves.  \n\nMany fans have asked for those tracks to be released to the public because they were harder and had so much energy to them. \n\nRight after New Years Eve in 2023 Alec took the analogue tapes and digitized them (after 30 years!) and decided to work with his friends from Hellish Vortex Studios to create a collection of single item NFTs. \n\n\n“A dubplate existed only once. Now I can create these special NFTs for people! \n\nIt’s so much fun because every NFT feels like a very personal link between me and the collector. \n\nIt only exists once!” \n\nAlec Empire\n\nThe fact that Alec decided to skip 2 decades of web2 music streaming and mp3 sales and went straight to NFTs for this could be seen as a statement in itself. \n\n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🏴💻💾💥💥💥💥💥💥🦾🌎 \n\n#alecempire #atariteenageriot #NFT #ethereum #cryptoartists #EthereumNFT #NFTcommunity \n#electronicmusic #techno #acid #berlin #DJ",
