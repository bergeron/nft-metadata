    "description": "Missed the Otherside public sale? Not a whale to afford land for 2+ eth? Not a problem! Just join The Otherside DAO! We are a NFT community and running the Otherside's DAO to help others participate in NFT show by Yuga Labs . Our main goal is to collect funds from Pass minters and to purchase Otherside land on the secondary market. Every Pass holder will be a part of our Treasury fund and will own a part of the Otherside land. We plan to collect 50 eth. With 10 Otherside lands purchased we will have a good chance to get Koda airdrop. We're also planning to use this DAO in future sales by Yuga Labs.",
