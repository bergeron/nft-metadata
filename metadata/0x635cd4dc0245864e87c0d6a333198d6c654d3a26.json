    "description": "Tales of Time, pendulum #1  \nThe wonderful Time Machine center piece of the films, operated by the Keeper of time, a fitting opening piece for the films as it is my  \nGenesis Ai film art work.  \nThe first Ai infused artwork from director Sundog. \nAfter starting this collaboration with Derrick,, I got stuck in and studied these wonderful Ai tools. As always, I want to stay one step ahead of the technology growth and tools avail to me, to make films and art.  \n4 months after starting the collaboration, watching, learning, doing online tutorials and getting wonderful advice from the Ai art community I am able to now do this myself.  \n in this time I have studied the Google collab notebooks, Disco Diffusion, Turbo and warp, I have been blessed with being invited to become one of the early Beta Testers for the wonderful new  Stable Diffusion from Stability.ai , I have been invited into 3 other Ai art collaborations. Using most of these tools in a single workflow and adding them to my already vast digital image manipulations skills via post production, DaVinci resolve, fusion premier editing photoshop aftereffects etc. This has turned into a wonderful decon-reconstruction of my film making and artistic career.  \nWhen we started this Ai infusion to the original Cold Fusion short film (unreleased) there was no such thing as Ai video Turbo or Warp. All of this has been invented in the past 4 months. This tech is moving faster than we can finish the film, the looks have changed and will continue to change as the industry catches up to what we started out to do and making it a lot easier, opening new avenues I have not yet started to consider using, as those workflows are all there for the next film I make. only then I will be thinking and filming with Ai artistry in mind..  \nTherefore, I will be releasing the clips individually, a wonderful collections of a time stamp of AI film making  \nI filmed the clock tower  pendulum in the clock tower at the waterfront in Cape Town South Africa and designed the Ai  infusion art with the Disco Diffusion V5.4 with warp\n\nWhen you compare the genesis supporter tokens, You can get an idea of the film we are making.\n\nI created the film with friends and family,  \n\nThis token will grant Access to token gated experiences and screenings,  BTS screenings in our complex of virtual portal connected cinemas and dens in Spatial (Vr and Ar enabled_) and other distribution platforms.\n\nworking with film footage shot on RED digital cinema cameras by Sundog, and fusing it with the brilliant AI Artistry from Ai artist @Psychederic  \nthe delicate wonder the Ai is adding to the film is mind blowing",
