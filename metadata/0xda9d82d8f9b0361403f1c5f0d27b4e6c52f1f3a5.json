    "description": "Why do I paint animals ? \n\nAnimals are the creation of the creator, just like nature and we humans. They are graceful and delicate. They are majestic and powerful. They are infinitely beautiful and noble. Yes, they don't know how to talk. But Elvira believes that inside they are very smart and can know much more than a person. They are very kind and only want to live peacefully in their own world. But what are people doing? Using our strength and capabilities, we catch these defenseless creatures, put them in cages, take away the most important thing from them - freedom! We abuse them, create zoos, circuses, and again in order to only satisfy our selfish need: entertainment. Is it correct ? Would a person want to be treated the same way? \n\nLook at the animals in my paintings. They cannot convey their thoughts to us, but they are able to feel, think, love, be kind. Animals do not interfere with man's life. But man? The complete opposite.\n",
