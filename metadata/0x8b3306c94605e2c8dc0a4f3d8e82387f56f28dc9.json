    "description": "Sometimes you have to wait for the last hours of the day. I was very tired from the trip near sunset. I wanted to go home as soon as possible. Then I saw the shepherd and his flock, the sky was colorful. I immediately reached for my camera and pressed the shutter button. It was then that I had the opportunity to capture the colors of distant lands.",
