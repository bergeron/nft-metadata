    "description": "\"Play golf, have a walk in the forest, fish at the lake with your friends... escape the infernal heat of earth and rediscover the pleasures of natural areas\". The white rabbit's hole invites you to explore a landscape of digital nature and live virtual experiences in a world where global warming doesn't exist. Nowadays, we're confronted with the violence of climate change and yet we dream of living in virtual worlds and continue to deny the harsh reality. Are we going to wake up in time or do we prefer to enjoy the pleasures of wonderland until the end ?",
