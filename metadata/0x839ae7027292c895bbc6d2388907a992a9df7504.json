    "description": "\"Grizzly Encounters\"  \nArtist: Byron Fichter\n\nFresh out of hibernation, Grizzlies are on the move! This was my first time spotting this majestic beast in the wild. I was lucky enough to snap off a few quick shots with my telephoto lens, as this male was intently focused on his queen a few yards away. \n\nMoving with the agility of a house cat, adult grizzlies can tip the scales at nearly 800 pounds. Moves that gain this magnificent mountain of muscle instant street credit. Undoubtedly, the king of Yellowstone National Park. \n\n**WARNING** Grizzly bears (and all wild animals) can be extremely aggressive, and dangerous. Please do not approach wild animals. Yellowstone National Park suggests keeping a minimum distance of 100 yards (or a football field) distance between yourself, and grizzlies.",
