    "name": "EYE IN THE LAKE",
    "description": "This photo was taken with a drone in the Yarisli lake of BURDUR province, from a height of approximately 400 m.\n\nThe dryness of the summer months has reduced the water level in the lake, the birds and other creatures living in the lake are having a hard time.\nEspecially the habitats of migratory birds are disappearing day by day.\n\nThey walk for hours on the lake, which has started to dry, in the hope of finding food and feeding. The shapes they create during this time are interesting.\n\n  I likened this image formed on the surface of the lake to the eye .\n\nMaybe mother nature is trying to attract people's attention, trying to reveal the situation of drying lakes, birds and nature that are in danger of life.\n\nMother nature creates wonders with her art, it is pleasant to watch these images, but the truth is that nature disappears.\n\nPlace: AFYON / Turkey \n\nDate: 18.09.2022\n \nCamera:Hasselblad-DRONE MAVÄ°C 3 PRO\n\nOriginal size:4200 x 3146 px 300 dpi\n\nOriginal format :RAW\n\nEdition: 1/1\n",
