    "description": "As my family entered 2020, we were preparing for the arrival of our first baby. The first couple of months came and went as we waited to meet him. Then, March came and with it COVID came to America. We welcomed our son to the world in June of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic. The world worked to flatten the curve, but people kept getting sick. World-wide supply lines came to a screeching halt and basic staples like toilet paper became scarce. My wife captured this image at a Target in Fort Worth, Texas on September 2, 2020, when our son was just over 2 months old. His life will be very different from ours; not because of advances in technology, but instead because the fear of the next global pandemic will never subside. To my family, this image represents pain, fear, restlessness, anxiety, and - most of all - hope. While the world suffered and lost many souls, we survived and we will thrive, whatever may come.
