NFTs in this collection represent an upgradeable on-chain credential, turning a positive contribution to the world of open data into a flex! The NFTs design and music will evolve to reflect one's contribution. The more you build, the better the art and music. Made in collaboration with French 3D artist [Armel Marchadour](https://www.instagram.com/armel_marchadour/) and [Le Minist√®re](https://www.instagram.com/leministere.studio/) music Studio.",
