    "description": "In the year of 2666, humans have found a way to survive on the red planet. There, they are still doing terraform process by blowing up nuclear bombs as many as possible. Unexpectedly, they find a treasure in the underground of the red planet. And to be able to take it, they need a lot of human resources. So, they have a plan to take the teenagers on Earth to help them find the treasure. Earth is already too messed up! For that reason they offer a bright future on the red planet. But the future isnâ€™t always bright. After arriving there, Mars is still like hell and the teenagers will only be enslaved.\nSome teenagers are forced to follow all their orders. And some teenagers escape to a town called Solis Planum, a dead city with giant skull monuments and blood-red rivers. That's where the teenagers hide, commit suicide, have fun and plan for their revenge.",
