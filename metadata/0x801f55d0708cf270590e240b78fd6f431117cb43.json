    "description": "I took this photo in 2017 during my trip to Yazd\nYazd is one of the ancient cities of Iran and the first brick city in the world.\nThis living atmosphere reflects impacts of environmental and cultural conditions of the city.\n\nIn Yazd, architecture of the city is strikingly unique due to considering residents' ease and protecting them from the oppressive heat and burning sun of the desert\n\nSabat, a roofed structure on some parts of narrow streets, was used as a feature of traditional architecture in hot climate areas to avoid sunlight making pedestrians feel relaxed for a moment in the breeze drifted in.\nBy providing shade and getting the air to flow in, Sabats cool and soothe everyone walking beneathâ€Œ. \n\nThis photo won the Khayyam Gold Medal at the Khayyam International Photo Festival, an honorary diploma of the Bristol Festival in England : \n\nhttps://khayyam.photo/Result/View/2017/2/111192/False\n\nJPEG image\nEdition: 1/1 \nSize 3000 *  4500 px",
