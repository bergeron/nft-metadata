    "description": "Undress to the nakedness of love.\n\nVenus in Pisces.\nLove in exaltation.\nA force that invades just like the ocean and transcends everything.\n\nA hopeless romantic, she seeks only what satisfies her deepest fantasies. She is enchanted by ethereal love, she longs for sacred connections, and to experience love like a deep state of meditation.\n\nBut she can get lost in the sea of idealization as well.\n\nVenus in her exaltation operates in her highest expression. If thereâ€™s any part of you not yet receptive to love, Venus in Pisces is bringing the healing, the forgiveness, and is supporting you to soften up. \n\n\nInsights: Astro By Nala\nArtwork: Midnight Moon Visuals",
