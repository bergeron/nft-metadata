    "description": "This is one of my favourite shots of my trip to China. We stopped by this temple near Beijing just after visiting the Great Wall of China. \nAnything compared with the Great Wall may seems small and negligible. However, I was amazed by the sense of peace and silence you get by walking through the gardens of this mystical place.\nEvery time I look at this photo, I remember that feeling of being safe and at ease with the world.",
