    "description": "A clown with a bad haircut came to the door.  He was old, or at least looked it.\n\n“Hi! I’m here to practice my clowning. Are you the neighbors? I was told to come here.”\n\nI wondered if he was too thin.  He looked at me blankly, then repeated himself in a different tone of voice, “Hi! I’m here to practice my clowning. Are you the neighbors? I was told to come here.”\n\nIt was an audition, I presumed.\n\nI ushered him into the living room. My friends stared at the clown as he stood in the corner. They were appalled. “This guy looks awful... What is his name?”\n\n“Ronny! He’s a clown.” I said.\n\n“Is he here to join us?”\n\nRonny smiled nervously. “I'm here to practice my clowning.”",
