    "description": "Mola Art Parrots - a bird, often vividly colored, with a short down-curved hooked bill, grasping feet, and a raucous voice, found especially in the tropics and feeding on fruits and seeds. Many are popular as cage birds, and some are able to mimic the human voice.\n\nThese spectacular birds, the red and green macaws, are one of five macaw species that live in the rainforest of Panama. \n\nParrots represent voice, communication, and the power of words.",
