    "description": "Salvator Mundi (Latin, ''Savior of the World'') is a painting attributed in whole or in part to the Italian High Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, dated between 1499 and 1510. Although long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with a repainting, it was rediscovered, restored and included in a major exhibition of Leonardo's work at the National Gallery in London in 2011-2012. Christie's stated, just after selling the work, that most leading scholars consider it an original work by Leonardo, but this attribution has been disputed by other specialists, some of whom argue that he only contributed some elements.\n\nThis digital restoration of the work, has been done with different image editing techniques, resulting in an improved replica, retaining attributes of the original, the piece is digitally unique.\n\n",
