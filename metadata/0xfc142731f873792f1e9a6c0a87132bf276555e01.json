    "description": "first open edition!! \n\nETH raised will be used to film a live full band session of the song.\ngolden egg winner will be airdropped the video <3 \n\ni started writing and producing this one back in August and immediately became attached to it. something about the acoustic guitar and simple lyric concept just had a hold on me. it was written about the final stages of getting broken up with, when you know it's over and don't really even care to continue talking about it. although most of my stuff I've released has been self-produced, i really wanted someone else's ears on this one... so, none other than Petro AP (who i met at Afterparty !!) joined in on the production. Petro really helped me take the song where it needed to go. it then was mixed by his brother, Yianni, and mastered by Théo Quayle. - bay area dream team! the entire process from start to finish was so much fun and i am so hyped for it to be out.\n\nwritten by Peter Saputo\nproduced by Peter Saputo & Petro Anastos-Prastacos\nmixed by Yianni Anastos-Prastacos\nmastered by Théo Quayle",
