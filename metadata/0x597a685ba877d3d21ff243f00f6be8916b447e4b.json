    "description": "DDC Rings are very special rare rewards sent out to the holders of Demon Death Cult: Season 1 NFTs with the rarity traits \"Chaos Goddess\" and \"Cosmic Horror\".\n\nIn total there will be 3 different rings in this collection, with each new ring being sent out every 6 weeks to anyone holding these particular demon types from Season 1.\n\nIf you collect and hold all 3 rings, you will receive a valuable, special, mystery gift on October 1st and December 25th of 2022.\n\nIf you continue to hold your 3 rings past that date, there will be more future rewards announced in 2023.\n\nIf you arrived too late to DDC to receive an older ring as a free airdrop, you can try to buy one on the marketplace.\n\nJoin the Discord community and read the FAQ channel for more information here: https://discord.gg/ddc\n\nFollow the project on Twitter: https://twitter.com/demondeathcult",
