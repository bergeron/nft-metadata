    "description": "I'm Oomm, a non-swimmer who fell in love with the sea after overcoming her phobia. Free diving was one of the first things I learnt to do.\n\nI feel that anyone who gets the opportunity to discover the underwater world, which interests me, will be fascinated by the sea's magic without even recognizing it.\n\nTo represent the story that takes place beneath the water, I used a pretty pink color in this piece of art. Because I know the undersea world is a distinct planet full of pure love, calm, and breathtaking natural beauty. Various creatures with eye-catching hues that draw the spectator in.\n\nIt makes me and a lot of other people love them and want to explore it.\n",
