    "description": "We are so conversant with the statement \"Appearance is not reality\" \nBut in reality, we tend to be carried away by just what we see, hear and feel without really paying attention to the underlying state which is most times hidden by the surface appearance. \nIf we could only go a bit deeper we may find out things we never thought were, and by so doing, help people when they face some challenges that they have no courage to talk about. \nShowing real concern will make this world a better place.",
