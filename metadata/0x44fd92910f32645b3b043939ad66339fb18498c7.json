    "description": "Sneak, slink, climb in. Moribund and ignored, despite the wisdom steeped within these walls.  As the building draws its final breath, it divulges more about you and I than it ever couldâ€™ve in its prime. Listen closely and you too can hear the secrets it shares.\n\nLost Cause is an ongoing series documenting the wistful allure of desolation and decay. Many of these abandonments are no longer with us.",
