    "name": "Embryo Moon",
    "description": "I'm sure we've all sat and studied the moon for a long time on one of those long beautiful nights. And each of us likened the patterns on the Moon to different different beings.\nI have an analogy, too, of course. I have likened the Moon to an embryo in the womb every time I look up at the sky.I wanted to turn this scene that I saw every night into an illustration.And I did this illustration three years ago. Today, for Mft, I processed this scene in every phase of the Moon and brought it together in one frame.I would like to share this work with an art lover who, like me, likes to study the night, the sky, the stars..",
