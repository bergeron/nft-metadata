    "description": "The journey has just begun.  Usually, the first couple are easy.  It took me 11 days to reach my first milestone.  \nToday, 10/21/22 I went to the duck pond by my house. \nThe ducks and geese were playful. A man and his dog arrived, almost like it was their routine. They were beautifully lit along the bank, and I found myself in a perfect spot for a backlit image.  Luck has found me this day!\nThe sun is warm and fall is in full swing. It is the season of change.  I am changing. \nThis is the first image of this collection. \nI will celebrate every 5 because it means I am progressing and moving forward to my goal.\nOn to the next image! See you at 10lbs!",
