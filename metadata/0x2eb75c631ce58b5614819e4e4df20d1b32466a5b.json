Driving into town I could see the dunes towering above and realized this wasn't like any desert I had been to before, the scale here was much bigger.\n\nAt sunset, I climbed up one of the tallest dunes and was met with this extraordinary view. Sandunes stretch as far as the eye can see, glowing in the golden light. An evening I will never forget.",
