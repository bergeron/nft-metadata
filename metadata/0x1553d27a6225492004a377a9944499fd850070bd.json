    "description": "It all started with this one drawing, so it will help me start over!\n\nBasicaly I was living a web3 dream, almost able to quit my IRL job, become a full time artist and move to the place where my heart belongs. It was so fucking close. But then... I got scammed. \n\nI lost almost everything I ever made with my art, almost a year of work, its all gone, completely lost. My wallet was left empty. Im ashamed and angry and the thoughts of leaving web3 and give up has been on my mind for quite some time now.\n\nBut even with that, I still have the support from the community, the many friends and experiences I got from working with so many amazing people, the feeling of finally belonging somewhere and, most important, the family I have found.\n\nThank you for helping me one last time on trying to rebuild what I achieved and got lost!  \nMy deepest thanks to every single one of you that have been with me in this journey. I'll never forget your support and kindness. Now, let`s keep building, be safe out there, may this Dragon always protect your wallet and shall we never give up on our dreams!",
