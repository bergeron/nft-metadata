    "description": "Abandoned in the zoo by her father when she was a little girl, Lana grew up surrounded by animals, boundaries and the sounds of a subdued wilderness.\n\nRaised by animal trainers, the zoo is the only world she knows. She learns to appreciate the graceful steps of the hippo, the elegance of the giraffe, the dignity of an elephant flipping it's ears. As time passes, Lana forgets her father.\n\nOne day, a handsome young man enters her world, a charismatic cowboy who knows some magic tricks and charms her. Lana falls in love and becomes his assistant in performing magic. At his side, she leaves the zoo for the very first time.\n\nDigital Art\n4000 x 5600 px\nJPG",
