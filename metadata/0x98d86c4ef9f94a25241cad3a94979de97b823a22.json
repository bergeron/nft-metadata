    "description": "A couple years ago I decided to DM one of my favorite artists, Blackbear. That resulted in him following me on instagram (we love to cold DM). A few months after that I posted a video of a song I had just written that morning, and he messaged me and said let's work on this in the studio together. After the shock wore off, I went in with him to work on it, and then I went in with one of his most trusted producers: Aaron Harmon. Working with both of them was such a good time, and it was so inspiring. It's one of my favorite songs I have ever put out, so I'm so excited to be able to put it on Sound. \n\nI hope you like it :)",
