    "description": "Gaia in her human life was a priestess of the forest, she would tend to nature and listen to the voices of the trees every waking moment. Gaia, The Saviour was trampled in the chaos of the great fall. The spirits of the forest looked upon her with great kindness and gave her a blessing. She returns as a physical embodiment of these spirits, wielding unparalleled strength. She wanders the battlefield, seeking revenge on those who dared to attack her precious Munsay Flatlands."
