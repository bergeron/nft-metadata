    "description": "Chromesthesia is an ongoing project in which I take AI generated imagery, original drawings and fractal creations and run them through various applications multiple times until they are deconstructed into glitchy abstractions. \n\nThis new series is a collection of hybrid paintings that combine my Chromesthesia artwork and abstract paintings in digital collage.\n\n4000x4000 JPG",
