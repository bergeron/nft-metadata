    "description": "Years ago, we spent summers on a Black Sea beach that was part of a former military zone, and very few people knew of its existence. Golden sand, turquoise water, cool forest nearby. In such a place, someone, millennia ago, probably invented the concept of heaven. \n\nToday, the site is protected by law as a habitat for rare species of plants and animals. A group of activists continues to fight for its preservation. However, the area became famous, began to fill with people, and resembled any other popular site.",
