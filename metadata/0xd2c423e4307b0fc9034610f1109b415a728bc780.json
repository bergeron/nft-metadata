    "description": "Enervation was coined from the Latin word 'ENERVATUS'\n\nThis piece expresses how the world feels exhausted as one organism. \n\nUnwritten rules govern the written rules in the real world aspect of society, which maybe we don’t talk about more often but we know it and it eats us up from the inside like a parasite. \n\nNuance is only seen only when it suits us. We gotten so used negativity that even positives become a scarce commodity. \n\nUnknowns try to put us into groups so as to put out differences between the organs that make us up as humans, spreading us too thin. \n\nHence our exhaustion, our Enervation. \n\nNimi, 2023✨",
