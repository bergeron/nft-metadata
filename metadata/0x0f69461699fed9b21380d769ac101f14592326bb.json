    "description": "My first paid minimal mint, marking a new stage in the sickart.eth/A5ht4r art journey.\n\nThere is a contemplative and meditative quality to extreme geometric minimalism.\n\n- In some cases the spaces are as important, if not more important than the painted shapes. The spaces can give us a place to relax, to defocus and then take in the piece as a whole.  \n \nThe name is a tribute to one of my favourite ambient albums by Boards of Canada. I think it resonates a lot with the theme of extreme minimalism and the name fits with the arrangement of two columns of squares.\n\nIf you print it out and put it on your wall please show me on my Twitter at https://twitter.com/a5ht4r - I would love to see it.\n\nUse as you please for non commercial purposes but please give credit. If you want to use for anything else please contact me on Twitter.\n\nNB: As always no guarantees are made for future value. This is for the art and if I can earn back some money to pay my costs like gas/taxes and perhaps enough to buy more art that would be fantastic but you never know with such things. Please enjoy!",
