    "description": "Art is our way of contributing to the rich beauty of our world. The medium of AI embeds a sense of reverence for humanityâ€™s technological progress, highlighting the harmonious relationship between human creativity and artificial intelligence. \n\nGuided by a handcrafted dataset, the artificial intelligence has learned to paint visions of an abstract world. A vivid landscape existing only within the digital mind of the machine, otherwise inaccessible to humanity. The Visio(n)s collection consists of 383 pieces hand-picked from thousands of artworks painted by the A.I, each derived from a direct relationship between man and machine.",
