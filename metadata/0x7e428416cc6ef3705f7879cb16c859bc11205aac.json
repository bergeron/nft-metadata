    "description": "The work is the process.\n\nThe proposition in the PROGRESS project is to explore the process of painting on an endless canvas. One file, no layers, no undo, no edition, no end. It is an infinite painting, and every minted piece is a snapshot of a moment when the painting has an interest by itself. And then keep going, moving forward, with no possibility of going back.\n\nAll the pieces reflect the evolution of my skills, my thoughts, my interest, my state, and my PROGRESS. It is a project that aims to explore the artist's journey and the painting process through digital media, the abundance of resources and the scarcity of on-chain ownership.  \n____________________  \n\n\nDigital Painting  - 4096 x 2732",
