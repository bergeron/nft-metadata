    "description": "\"Love\" is a reflection on the fact of loving and an apology on the need to love above any fear and overcoming any obstacle.\n\nThis work is a joint creation between the digital artist Josué Moreno, the musician Ernesto Cisneros and the actress Saray Casares.\n-----------\n\n\n\"Love.\nTo love the emptiness in a form of a window.\nLove in the sheepwreck\nAnd to love like a stranger,\nin silence,\nperfectioning the remoteness.\nLoving with bons are tramble,\nthe endless nights existing.\n\nLove.\nBecause one can not love with so much wild\nand demented ego,\nwith so many bodies in the way,\nwith so much fear to the own body.\n\nLoving like a burning paper,\nthe fogging sight of invisible clothes,\nthe heart vibrating\nthrough a pinhole;\nand beyond the lightness\nof a moment,\nloving this tiny life,\nthat blossom and die after,\nand this is her essence:\nexisting.\"\n\n-------------\nPoem, animation, editing: Josue Moreno\nOriginal music: Ernesto Cisneros\nVoice: Sarai Carares\n\n1920x1080\n2´ 13´´\n\n\n",
