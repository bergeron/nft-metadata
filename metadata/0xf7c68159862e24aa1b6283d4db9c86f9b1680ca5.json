    "description": "ब्राह्मी(Brahmi) goddess to all knowledge, music, art, speech and learning.\nBrahmi is another\r name for Devi Saraswati, which means the energy of Brahm(Supreme God).This artwork\r\nconcludes my growing interest in murals, graffiti and poster art. It is a tribute to Goddess\r Saraswati for everything I've learned. Merging a deity with India's emerging pop art culture\r was my perspective throughout the art process. Starting with a portrait by choosing the right\r pose and painting it all in b/w.\nSaraswati Ji is always seen with a veena,\r\nVed and a Jaap-maala.I gave the Veena a fantasy approach to show the enlightenment and balance of knowledge throughout the\r universe. The mural background includes various mantras, chants and symbols ॐ of Hindu\r mythology.\r\nTools: Ibispaint mobile-4k\nArtwork by afterlife\n\n\r** Music/Vocals by Samarth Saxena,recorded in studios with pro musicians, exclusive to the Rebel Club's Diwali Collab, with 15+ artists.\n\nLicences\n\nArtwork: CC BY-SA\nAudio: CC-BY-NC-SA",
