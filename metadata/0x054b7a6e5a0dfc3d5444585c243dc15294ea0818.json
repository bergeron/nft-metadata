    "description": "Title: Mujer Hongo\nDate: 2021\nPhotography-based digital manipulation.\nThe work arises from the idea of ​​representing the end of the life cycle. When our bodies unite with the earth and soil. When the little that remains of a human being serves as food for the flora. \n\"Mujer Hongo\" is an allusion to the fusion between two living beings with different anatomy. It is a representation of the stability of living systems as a community of fungi and frogs, as well as different roots and rocks.\nI seek to represent in the most dreamlike way possible the final stage of death and how life can arise from it.",
