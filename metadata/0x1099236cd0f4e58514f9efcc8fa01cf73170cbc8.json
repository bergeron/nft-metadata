    "description": "Sometimes nature reminds you that she is unpredictable, dangerous and powerful, like on this day along the Bretagne coastlines in France. The weather forecasts announced a cloudy day with light rains, and till the last minute was not wrong. Then suddenly my luck came back, the sky started to get clearer at the horizon, allowing the sun to appear under the clouds and offering this brilliant sunset to my eyes.\n\nTake a seat, breathe deeply and let your imagination go. Imagine the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks, the song of some seagulls resonating from the steep cliffs, the smell of the sea salt brought to you by the wind. Imagine a fresh breeze stroking your cheeks and the thin sand running on your feet. Look up, admire the clouds moving, and feel the warmth of the sun on your skin.",
