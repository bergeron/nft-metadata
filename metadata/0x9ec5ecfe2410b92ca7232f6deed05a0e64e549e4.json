    "description": "If there is something more powerful than a thousand punches, it is a look. In this analog photo I will call you beyond boxing and punches. Because you cannot beat emotions, emotions are above all physical blows. So is a look. Sometimes it breaks silence, sometimes it mobilizes an army. Sometimes a look expresses only sadness, sometimes a look is poetry. But in the end, a look is stronger than all blows and punches.\n\nThe eyes always win.\n\nCamera: Yashica Fx3 Super 2000  \nFilm: Fujifilm Fujicolor c200",
