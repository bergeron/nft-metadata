    "description": "Kalapootu is a Bull Race conducted in Kerala, India by a farmer's community. It's a big festival here in some parts of Kerala.\nIn between the competitive junior category bulls and rider runs through the track for training purpose.\nThis rider couldn't run as fast as the bull and he started to fall down but he tried his maximum to hold on, this effort resulting me with this awesome frame giving a feeling that the rider is flying in the air hence the title \"Bull Rider Flight\"\n\nCAPTURED WITH NIKON D7500 + NIKON 200-500 MM LENS\nCAPTURED AT PALAKKAD, KERALA, INDIA\nCAPTURED ON 20 JULY,2022",
