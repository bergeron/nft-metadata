    "description": "The scenery of Mount Fuji at Lake Kawaguchi. I took this photo in the fall of 2016. \n\nI still remember the feeling that day, because the previous day had been raining heavily all day, causing a thick fog that morning. the fog was so thick and I couldn't see Mount Fuji at all. I can only hope that when the sky is clear the fog will fade. \n\nAfter waiting for about four hours,the mist began to fade and Mount Fuji appeared. At that moment, a fisherman's boat passed by and stopped in the middle of the frame. The picture I saw gave me the impression that nature was truly grand and humans are just tiny creatures.\n",
