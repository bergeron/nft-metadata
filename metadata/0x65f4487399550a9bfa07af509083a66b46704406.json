    "name": "New England Aster",
    "description": "At first glance, the New England aster looks like a single flower. Itâ€™s actually a composite consisting of ray flowers that each produce one petal and a multitude of disk flowers at the center. This is a brilliant collaboration. The petals provide attractive landing pads for bees and other insects, while the disk flowers serve up nectar and pollen sought by pollinators. Think of it as a restaurant with outdoor seating.",
