    "description": "This is a collection by Itonk Studio, inspired by an architectural term called Béton Brut, meaning “raw concrete”. It refers to the aesthetic of unfinished concrete after being removed from formwork. This is an important term in the architectural world -  the appearance of Béton Brut was a pinnacle of modernism. Subsequently, the aesthetic of Béton Brut led to the style of brutalism. \n\nThis is the base of Itonk Studio’s new body of work. The drawings are exploring the volumes, perspectives, depths and shadows found in architecture, combining them with Béton Brut-typical roughness, rawness and washed-out colours.",
