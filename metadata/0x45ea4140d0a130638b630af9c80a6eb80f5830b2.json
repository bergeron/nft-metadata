    "description": "Every time I look at this photo,I think about all struggles we have in life. How sun rises and it sets,how ships confront small and big waves to arrive to their destination, just like human's life. When I'm a little disappointed in my life I look at this & it makes me continue,it makes me believe in my cause & try to accomplish my goals even harder.",
