    "description": " Elizabeth I (1533 - 1603) was the Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 until her death in 1603. She is also referred to as the Virgin Queen as she never got married nor had any children. Elizabethâ€™s reign is generally seen as marking the beginning of the British Empire, during which English privateers and explorers were making expeditions to America. Protestantism also consolidated its hold in England while the country fought off the threat of conquest by Spain, which was the superpower of the time.  \n - This quote was the remark that queen Elizabeth uttered when she was told she would be a queen.
