    "description": "Onyema is a girl filled with questions and curiosity\nBorn into a world filled with longing thoughts 'Who Knowsâ€™, \nAgainst all odds, Would I triumph, \nWho knows what the future holds for me?'\nShe spent the early years of her life afraid of never fitting in. \nAfraid to try, Onyema watched life pass her by.\n\nLooking for answers, unsure of possibilities,\nIn search of relief, She stumbles upon her past self\nAligned with her present, She comes to realize\nAlthough there aren't certain answers to her questions\nOne thing remains Constant, Which is in fact HER\n\nWho she is, a person, living, working, dreaming\nHer Past, Present, and the Unknown\nHer Values, and Her Knowledge\n\nI am Onyema and with me comes these endless questions,\nI've chosen to live in the moment \nNo one has the answers to my questions except God.\nAlthough it seems unclear, I haven't been more sure\n\nI believe we are all Onyemas at a certain point in our lives\nBut I urge you in times of uncertainty Keep Trying.",
