    "description": "If you look into the darkness for a long time, does the darkness begin to look at you?\nIt is already there. Darkness does not always mean evil, and light does not always bring good. \nDarkness is attracted by the unknown, it attracts our hearts. In the darkness, everything is just beginning.\n\nComposer Victor Zharov-Bulgakov",
