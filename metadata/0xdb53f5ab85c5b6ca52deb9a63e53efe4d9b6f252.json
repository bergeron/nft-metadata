    "description": "With only one day available to capture images on safari the pressure was on to find a leopard and get the dream shot for Nikon. Not an easy task but with some persistence and tenacity a serendipitous sighting in an iconic tree where a leopard had never been found before ended up yielding a shot of a lifetime. The sighting lasted about 2 hours and there was time pressure to leave but my experience told me this would probably be the only opportunity that day to get the shot. The risk paid off when this magnificent and stunningly beautiful large female turned her mesmerising gaze towards us just once. In that instance I knew I had captured the shot of my dreams and one that gives a strong sense of place to an apex predator relaxing in her jungle kingdom. A different photo of this scene became one of the key visuals chosen for the campaign.\n\nEdition of 15\n\nNikon D810 + Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8E FL + 2x teleconverter at 400mm \n\n1/320 f/5.6 ISO 800\n\n8400x5600 pixels\n\n300ppi",
