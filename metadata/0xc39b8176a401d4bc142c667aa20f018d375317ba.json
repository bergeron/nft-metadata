    "description": "We spend lifetimes outside of ourselves to find the Divine.  When It resides within us all along.  The journey of a monk to divinity is my piece - Monk in translation.  Detaching from the noise of this world and things that hold us back.  Reconnecting with our Atman, our soul and breathing life into our spirit.  The meaning of life is knowing there is no beginning and end itâ€™s a continuous cycle of lessons.  The only way through it, is thru self love, introspection and compassion.  ",
