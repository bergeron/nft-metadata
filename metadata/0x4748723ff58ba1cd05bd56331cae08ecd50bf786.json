    "description": "Sweetness is associated with the feeling of love, compassion, and kindness. Just as the taste of something sweet can bring pleasure and delight to our taste buds, experiencing sweetness in a spiritual sense can bring us a sense of joy and contentment. This can manifest in the form of a deep connection with others, a feeling of oneness with the universe, or a sense of gratitude for the blessings in our lives.\n\n## Find Hidden Objects:\n\n-\tA feather\n-\tAn apple\n-\tA crocodile\n-\tA cat\n-\tA fish",
