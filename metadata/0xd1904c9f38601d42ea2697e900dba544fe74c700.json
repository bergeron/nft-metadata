    "description": "A new work made of SVG, just 53kb minified. 'Known Function' is inspired by TV 'testcards' and an interpretation of one of the first ever digital paintings I ever made,  (Unknown Function, 2016)  – an all-time favourite. It's experimental in nature - hence the SVG, but still too large to put on-chain (gas!) which is a technically possible, albeit prohibitively expensive.\n\nThere will be 250 editions. I plan 150 on ETH, 50 on XTZ and 50 on SOL. Any buyer of an AltJames artwork from 2021 and 2022 is eligible to claim a copy or will be airdropped one. 1 per collector per chain. The rest will be placed on the open market.",
