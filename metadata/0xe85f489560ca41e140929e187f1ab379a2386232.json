    "description": "My little cousin’s painting is on my design as a print. Cocktail dress: metal embossing on textured fabric\n\nI love children’s random drawings they are just so perfect to me. \nLet me introduce him. His name is Asaf. He is 6 years old and he just started school this year. His favourite activities are fighting with her little sister, puzzles, scooter and swimming.\nHe is from Bursa, Turkey and he did this painting when we were in a lockdown in corona. He is sometimes so outgoing but sometimes you really don’t wanna mess with him:D ",
