The CatrickMuffy were generated from a smart contract using over 200 different hand drawn traits. These uniquely designed NFTs will help members to unlock future exclusive perks, drops, raffles, content and more, but most importantly help animals and people in Ukraine, as we are donating 1/3 money from earnings. And other 1/3 we will invest in CartickMuffy future development to collaborate with other artists, to make CatrickMuffy more unique and involved into metaverse to make them more versatile.
