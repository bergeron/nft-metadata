    "name": "Anjali the Courageous ",
    "description": "Anjali is an Indo-Fijian woman who struggles with perfectionism OCD. This causes her to redo her job assignments repeatedly until they feel “just right”, so she often misses deadlines. Her coworkers call her lazy and nickname her “the crazy girl”. When Anjali catches wind of this, she feels ashamed and discouraged from speaking up.\n\nA graphic artist who adores fantasy, Anjali draws herself in full battle regalia, tearing a sticker from her mouth that reads, “She’s crazy.” She imagines herself breaking free from the stigma that is rampant at her company.\n\nWhen Anjali decides that she will not let the opinion of her coworkers keep her trapped, she summons the courage to ask for help.\n\nAnjali is a Stigma Fighter. \n\nThis piece is a collaboration with 5x TEDx speaker, Inc Magazine Top 100, and inspirational thought leader, Bobby Umar.",
