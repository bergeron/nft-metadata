    "description": "“the mind still gripped hard by the hands that would hold the skull even stiller if they could, that nothing distract, that nothing but the possible be let to filter through” — Jorie Graham\n\n\nSource Material: Manipulated video clips from the films “Choose Me”, 1984; “Wings of Desire”, 1987; “The Hudsucker Proxy”, 1994\n\nProcess: Video clips are “found” on the net, edited into fragments, upscaled via AI software, manipulated in PhotoMosh Pro, edited, layered and further manipulated in Final Cut Pro, then exported from Final Cut Pro to be manipulated again in PhotoMosh Pro and exported into GIF format. Still-images from these GIFS are selected and then layered, edited and manipulated in Adobe Photoshop to result in a final image.\n\nFile: .JPEG / 50.3MB — 7998x4500\n\nTools: iMovie, Topaz Video AI, PhotoMosh Pro, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop  \n",
