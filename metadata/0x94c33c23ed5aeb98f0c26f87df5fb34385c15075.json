    "description": "Hello, I'm not a particularly social person. Nature and fantasy are my substitutes. this is what I would like to present my story in a world surrounded by exotic plants and creatures. as if looking from the third eye\nHere, people and living beings live in peace, but they are filled with truth. It is the experience of traveling and what interests oneself to add color in this piece.\n\n",
