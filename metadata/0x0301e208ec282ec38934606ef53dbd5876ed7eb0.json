    "description": "“The Otherside” is the first music NFT in the hume NFT ecosystem. These 50 limited edition tokens not only grant you a spot on the allowlist for the Hume Genesis, but they are also the first music NFT’s from hume metastar, and the world’s most famous Fluf, angelbaby. \r\n angelbaby and the hume collective are on a mission to build an open and creative metaverse. In the year 3045 angelbaby is close friends with the bored ape currently owned by their friend Gino The Ghost. A collaboration between these two disruptors made perfect sense for this first release.\r\n We are hume. We are many. wearehume.com",
