    "description": "Owning this token gives you access to the Abstract Alpha Server (Gated server open only select bluechip communities). Abstract Originals V2 is a collection of 50 unique backgrounds & 666 supply designed to be companions to your current profile picture avatar. Layered with a new character in the Abstract world. The Abstract Devil. He’s perceived as evil, the villain when in reality this little devil is the hero. The collection shows many sides of the Abstract Devil you would never see unless you investigated. This collection is about breaking down perceptions while connecting you with your avatars on a new level. We’ll constantly be evolving, and finding new ways to connect you with your devil, my art and community.",
