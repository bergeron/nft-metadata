    "name": "Maria Alonso inside the «Fox fire»",
    "description": "This is 1 NFT in a collection of 5 animations that has been issued as a single, unique edition. Each NFT is dedicated to a great artist and his outstanding works.\n\nMaria loves coloring, often doing it when she is experiencing emotional distress. The idea for the fox came at that very moment. The fox's eyes are calm, but there is fire inside. Maria feels the same way.\n\nEvery artist gives energy to his paintings. That energy binds the artist and his painting forever and lives forever. I think the artist deserves to find himself in his paintings at least once.\n",
