    "description": "During the hours, days, and weeks of chasing storms during the monsoon in the southwest, I quite often fill the time listening to audiobooks or my favorite bands.  And yet these are moments of loneliness that I embrace.  I remember the unique sound of shuffling of paws by my German Shepherd and Norwegian Elkhound as they prepare to run into the open fields the moment I park atop a remote hill.  The whipping of the wind through mesquite and cacti gives way to a pelting of rocks and sand as the storm's outflow brings a momentary cooling of the desert floor.  And it's in these moments I am surrounded by bliss of silence from the voice of another human within miles.  It's a unification of land, water, and air when electricity joins the clouds to the ground.  These extraordinary moments allow me to sweep away anxiety and fear.  And soon after, the storm dissipates leaving behind the smell of creosote, crickets chirping, and an enhanced ability to hear my own heartbeat.  ",
