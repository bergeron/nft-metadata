    "name": "Blue and White Bowl",
    "description": "Inspired by blue-and-white porcelain art, this 3d digital art depicts two sections of drawings with blue outlines. The first section shows two kids celebrating and worshipping the tiger, the zodiac of this year. The second section depicts the lady staying near the tree getting a blessing from God, hoping she can do anything luckily as she expects. \nI put the Chinese word (Á¶è, fu) in the inner part of the bowl(which does not show in the video) to show my wish for everyone to live happily. I also stamped my name at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nEach buyer would receive a guidebook with an in-depth description of this porcelain.",
