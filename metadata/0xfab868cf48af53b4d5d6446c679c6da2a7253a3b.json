    "description": "The paradox of \"in and out\" speaks to the flux of life. It explores the idea that life is a constant cycle of coming and going, of entering and exiting. The concept of \"in and out\" symbolizes the impermanence and ever-changing nature of all things, a reminder that nothing is permanent and that all things are in a state of constant flux.\n\nThis paradox also reflects the idea that everything is connected and one experience or event leads to another. The ending of one chapter in life is the beginning of another. The exit of one person in our lives is the entrance of another. The \"in and out\" paradox speaks to the cyclical nature of existence and the need to embrace change and adapt to the ebb and flow of life.\n\nIt is a call to embrace the present, to appreciate the beauty of the moment, and to let go of what's gone and what's yet to come. The \"in and out\" paradox is a reminder that life is a journey, and we must make the most of it.\n\nVisual and Sounds by Joaquim Mutim 2022",
