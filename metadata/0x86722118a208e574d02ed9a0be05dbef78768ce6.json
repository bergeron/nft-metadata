    "description": "This generative art work is heavily influenced by Karl Sims' \"Genetic Images\" (1993).\n\nA composite mathematical function made from sines, multiplications, and additions translates the two dimensional information of position at each pixel to a point in the three dimensional color-space of red, green and blue.\n\nThese six hundred views are of the one equation, at different points in the infinite X,Y plane.",
