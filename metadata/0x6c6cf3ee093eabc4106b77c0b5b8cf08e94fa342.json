    "description": "Astral Pioneers (AP) is a collection of 10,000 trippy alien NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain. Each NFT is a programmatically unique mixture of 195 hand-drawn traits, with some being more rare than others. The AP NFT drop is intended as the beginning of a much larger development project involving an entirely new metaverse. AP also seeks to create a community of individuals interested in discussing topics such as astral projection and aliens. See AstralPioneers.com for details and be sure to join our Discord to participate in discussions about all of the above and more. AP grants users a nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use their owned NFT image as they see fit. Credit should be given to artist Malcolm Smith of Blue Pixie Comics."
