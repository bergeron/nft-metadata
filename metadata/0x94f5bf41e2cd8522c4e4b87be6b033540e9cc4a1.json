    "description": "To celebrate International Women's Day, I decided to offer my collection of digital drawings I've created 10 years ago.\n\nMy intention is to take a poetic look at the female body to symbolize its total ownership.\n\nFor me, one of the first essential rights is to dispose of your body as you wish:\n\n- have a child or not.\n- draw it, tattoo it, paint it...\n- accept sexuality as it's for you\n- refuse to be touched\n\nMy body is mine.\n\nWomen need attention, tenderness, respect.\n\nSome work also symbolize menstrual periods which could be so inconvenient, so rude for some girls and women in the World.\n\nHope this NFT would seduce you by the softness without vulgarity, but enough drawing strokes to suggest whatever sexual or erotic emotions.\n\nThey belong to your eye, dear visitor :)",
