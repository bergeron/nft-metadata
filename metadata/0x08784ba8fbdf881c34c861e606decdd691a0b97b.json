    "description": "In June 2018, in Saint Peter's Square, in the Vatican, there were thousands and thousands of people, many of whom were nuns, priests, Christians and of course tourists. After observing for a while, I began to see this individual praying on his knees in the street, begging for alms, as if it were his last day on earth. After a while, without taking my eyes off him, because it was quite impressive, I saw how he got up and went to a corner, where to my surprise there were two other individuals dressed like him, next to a priest, who seemed to be giving them instructions on how to act, a few seconds later, they separate, each one for his place and continue with the plan. That was just the moment when I decided to take the photo and immortalize it, to remind myself that appearances can be deceiving, so \"Beg or Cheat\", that is the question, what do you think?\nResolution 5184x3456\nLocation 41°54'06.7\"N 12°27'30.5\"E\nDate 28-06-2018, 11:06\n1/1 Series",
