    "description": "ENSpepes are a collection of 10,000 unique Pepe the Frog NFTs that live on the Ethereum blockchain. They are more than just digital collectibles, though. ENSpepes can be used to represent ownership of a Pepe the Frog avatar on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and they can also be staked to earn rewards in the form of PEPEMP tokens. PEPEMP tokens can then be traded on the PEPE Marketplace, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is currently under development.",
