    "description": "Tripper Troopers are surreal characters created by Goa based artist Rohan Joglekar and are part of his larger \"Happy In The Hippocampus\" collection of works. \n\nThe \"Happy In The Hippocampus\" collection is a surreal universe created by Rohan that features landscapes, emotions and characters. The characters in this representation of the artist's dream states are titled \"Tripper Troopers\". Juxtaposed by vivid and evocative backgrounds, the tripper troopers are imaginary characters that are in a state of self reflection. A state in which they apologetically question their decisions that result in pleasure, gratification and self actualisation while questioning their role in the larger universe of reality. \n\nThe Tripper Troopers represent an investigation into the disconnected dynamic of dreams and reality.",
