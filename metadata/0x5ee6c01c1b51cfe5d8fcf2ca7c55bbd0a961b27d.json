    "description": "It's my honor to see that you have chosen my music & paint. \nFor me, music is like painting, on a white canvas on which you pour your colors. I've used every color, without any specific rule, in its own framework and the present work is composed of different layers connecting various spaces and feelings.\nBy the way, the work is exclusively presented to you and i won't be considered the owner after your purchase.
