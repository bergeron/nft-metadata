    "description": "This is the 1st 1/1st NFT in a collection of 4 photographs.\nSize: 2656 x 3984 px\nThe big city is always about speed.\nThis city never sleeps. People are always running and rushing.\nSomeone is late for work again, someone is in a traffic jam taking a child to school, and someone is running to a meeting. Everyone wants to reach their goals as quickly as possible. But sometimes it's important to slow down and remember who you are.\nEvery woman wants to feel like a little princess. To remember their true desires and dreams. After all, so often we get someone else's imposed goals. In a huge city, it's easy to get lost in the abundance of choices and opportunities. It's important to choose your path, it's important to choose YOU.\nAnd do not forget that you are still the same little princess, who knows how to listen and hear HIM and enjoy the moment.\nThese photos helped me to see another side of Myself and to remember that I am still a little princess.",
