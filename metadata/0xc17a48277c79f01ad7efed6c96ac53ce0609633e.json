    "description": "Created by CreativeDepartmint \n\n    The \\V/alue project is about challenging our ideas of money, currency and art as the world moves from physical to digital and fiat to crypto.\n    \n\n    The first series of NFTs have a corresponding physical, IRL counterpart.\n    \n\n    Each piece has been hand-painted on US currency and catalogued with it’s treasury serial number before being tokenized as a high-resolution NFT on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n    \n\n    Some of these physical, IRL artifacts will be spent, gifted or otherwise put into commercial circulation.\n    \n\n    The others will be sent to the first owners of the NFT.\n    \n\n    With this project, I‘m trying to blur the lines and build a relationship between the physical and digital worlds by connecting IRL & NFT collectors of my art.\n    \n\n    Some of you have purposely collected my art while others have come across it accidentally. Some may find it, receive it as a gift or get it in exchange for something I buy from you-- for a dollar.\n    \n\n    My hope is that someday, the value of a dollar can change all of our lives.",
