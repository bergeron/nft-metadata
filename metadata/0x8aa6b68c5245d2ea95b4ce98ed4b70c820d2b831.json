    "description": "Hawaiian sea turtles are known as “aumākua” or spiritual guardians, navigators that guided the 1st Polynesians to the islands, a bridge between humans, land and water.  \n \nOne of the oldest creatures on earth, sea turtles embody a sense of peace and an ability to pull us into stillness. A reminder that everything we are seeking exists for us here in this moment. Inviting us to surrender to the flow and trust in the divine unfoldment of our lives - even when things aren’t going as planned. \n \nWe initially wanted to dive into an underwater cave, when a white tip reef shark patrolling the entrance, put us on a detour. Deciding not to intrude, we were photographing outside when this honu came flying out. \n\nGreen sea turtles are listed as threatened and protected under Federal/State laws. A portion of proceeds of this NFT sale will go towards the protection and preservation of Hawaiian sea turtles.\n\nMay this image bring longevity, protection and good luck to the collector(s) of this photo.\n",
