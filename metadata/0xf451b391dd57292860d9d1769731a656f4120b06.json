    "description": "Founder and creator \nBright idea solutions company (CEO)\nmr. samad Mohammed \nA flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.\nFlowers or clusters of flowers produced by twelve species of Angiosperms from different families.\nSelection of differently constructed flowers at different stages of vascular plant development\nThe two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant. Cross",
