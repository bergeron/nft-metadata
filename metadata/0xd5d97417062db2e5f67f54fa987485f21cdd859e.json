    "description": "We live in an incredibly fast-paced world. Most times, we get lost in a lot of activities and experiences that we really do not take the time to truly ponder and reflect.\n\n“REFLECTION” is an incredibly valuable practice. \n\nIt is a deeper form of learning that allows us to retain every aspect of any experience, be it personal or professional — why something took place, what the impact was, whether it should happen again — as opposed to just remembering that it happened. \n\nIt's about tapping into every aspect of an experience, clarifying our thinking and honing in on what really matters to us.\n\nPracticing self-reflection takes discipline and intentionality. It requires pressing pause on the chaos of life and simply taking the time to think and ponder about your life.",
