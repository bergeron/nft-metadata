    "description": "Spencer Brooklyn has created a series of skull artworks that ask questions about self-awareness and our relationship to time.\n\nAs in Dali's surrealist painting 'The Persistence of Memory', Brooklyn epitomizes Dali's theory of 'softness' and 'hardness' and transforms the concept on living entities. The skull acts as a bone protective cavity for the brain and the human skull is one of the least deformable structures found in nature with it needing the force of about 1 ton to reduce the diameter of the skull by 1cm.\n\nSpencer Brooklyn is exploring and playing with both conditions, on the outside the 'hardness' of the skull and on the inside the 'softness' of the brain. The digital created artworks can be seen as a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order and depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.\n\nAll work copyright Spencer Brooklyn 2023.
