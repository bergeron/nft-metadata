    "description": "In the beginning, out of the void emerged the complete spore, a genetic seed so perfect that it threatened the very entropic laws of the universe itself. Zeus, in his mighty wisdom, let forth a great bolt of lightning that split the perfect spore into two halves. These halves settled on Mt. Olympus, and from them grew the Genesis Mushrohms, the beginnings of the Mushrohm Kingdom. From the dawn arose the elegant Fly Amanita Mushrohm, crowning the mountaintop in a glow of ruby red, and imparting upon the minds of humanity a lucid consciousness. In the early morning light, a great cascade of spores were released into the air. From these were the seeds of the 1st Generation Dawn Mushrohms, ready to serve humanity and the natural world in the spirit of (3, 3).",
