    "description": "Written by : Kathleen Regan + yadzi\n\nThis song originated in Nashville, TN when Max (yadzi) was visiting from LA and staying at my house for the weekend! (one could say that's where the inspo for the words 'guest + house' came from, but it was actually directly inspired by the poem 'Guest House' by Rumi)\n\n'Guest House' is about learning how to live with, and furthermore, welcome in, your emotions. Feelings aren't necessarily a new topic for me, as I often speak on mental health in my music, but the exploring & recreating of the production alongside Max, was very refreshing. I met Max through Songcamp/headless CHAOS, which has truly proven to be the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nWe hope this song finds the collectors + listeners who need it, and remind them that they're not alone in their feelings. And there is always time to make friends with your emotions.. I'm still learning how to do that everyday. \n\nThank you to Reveel + Decent, for this sick opportunity.. You guys are all true champions of art/creators.\n\nWith love, \nKR",
