    "description": "My work is not \"collage,\" but rather the concept of \"bricolage\" as advocated by French social anthropologist Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss in his \"Wild Thought\" (bricolage = a collection of known things, reassembling them out of their original meaning to discover something new.) The concept of \"Bricolage\" is the basis of the work.\r\nThe basis of this concept is based on the idea that matter exists as a collection of particles in the world of science.\r\nThe shape we see now is merely a shape that happens to be created by something else that is not itself.\r\nTo symbolize this, I reconstruct one shape by combining various motifs. The bunny girl is usually conceptualized as very kitschy and sexy, but for me, that rabbit headdress feels very haunting."
