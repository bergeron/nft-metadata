    "description": "This art is about movement and change! That life circulates in us and we can always change everything, you just have to want it! \n\nThis art was created by me with my own hands on a physical real canvas and was finalized with the help of digital! If you wish, I can send the original physical picture! She is incredible and has a strong energy!!\n\nIts real size is 40x50, made with acrylic, with elements of texture paste!",
