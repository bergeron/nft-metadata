    "description": "This was the second in the series of a bird at night with a moon rise in the background. I wanted to explore the theme of having a bird patterned with colorful geometry after finishing the Great Egret piece, and the Toucan is one of my favorite birds. It's unlike any bird really. The big colorful beak says it all, and little swirly twirly zig zaggy patterns are inspired by Gustav Klimt's affinity for decorative details, Paul Gauguin's visualization of water, and a plethora of plants reminiscent of Henri Rousseau.",
