    "description": "Sometimes we lose our way and sight of our goals. We are held back by fear, by self-value, or by what we think others expect of us. By letting go of our fears we can move forward with an open mind and courage in our hearts.\n\nThis is my very first NFT offering, edition 1/1, and the first image in the collection “Evolution of an Artist”. That’s a lot of firsts!\n\nNFT Collector of the artwork will receive the original GIF file and may connect with me @alanaleephoto or www.alanaleephoto.com to also receive a JPG version of the still image, measuring 3000 pixels at 300 dpi, for printing (non-commercial license; personal use only)\n",
