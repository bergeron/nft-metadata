    "description": "The Man Who Fell to Earth is infused with a poetics that evokes a sense of loss, evoking the poetry and beauty of the universe, but also the fragility and transience of human existence.\n\nThe choice to represent an astronaut, a symbol of the conquest of the universe and scientific progress, in such a precarious and vulnerable position, represents a critique of mankind's presumption to control the universe, while at the same time exalting it as a heroic figure.\n\nPannoni invites the viewer to reflect on the nature of the human being, our desire for knowledge, and our constant search for a sense of belonging in the world, with an ode to the beauty of the unknown and the impossible.",
