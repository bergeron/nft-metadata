  "metadata": "{\"name\": \"Butterfly Haus Cannon Ball Figure 1\", \"description\": \"In June of 2021 Osaze Akerejah was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called Clear Cell Sarcoma. He underwent an initial tumor-removal surgery and a tough battle with radiation therapy. Despite the best efforts of his doctors and a second reconstructive surgery, an April 2022 biopsy revealed that the cancer has spread to his lungs, currently leaving him with aggressive Stage 4 cancer that continues to advance.\\n \\nUnfortunately, doctors have given him 12-18 months to live with no treatment and 18-36 months with some treatment. Doctors have prescribed him an expensive treatment medication called Cabometyx. He has decided to be transparent and vulnerable with you all because as of late he has been finding strength in the openness, so thank you for listening to him.\\n \\nAs a musician, teacher and clinical worker for children and families Osaze has dedicated his life to finding a way to utilize the arts as a tool for healing, fostering connection and bolstering a deeper understanding of the human experience, and as he embarks on this difficult health battle, he is seeking financial assistance to help him realize some art projects he wishes to usher into the world as well as funds to better grapple with the costs of battling cancer and ultimately getting his affairs in order in the event of his forecasted death.\\n \\nThere are financial constraints he is dealing with due to his condition and the high cost of producing as an independent creative and business owner. He has several bodies of work he wishes to produce and market with the hopes of them reaching people on a larger scale to hopefully help them navigate lifeb\u0000\u0019s ups and downs, using his story and experience with trauma as fuel to help others with their own battles with lifeb\u0000\u0019s obstacles.\\n\\nYou can also donate here: https://www.gofundme.com/f/musician-clinical-worker-battle-cancer\", \"image\": \"ipfs://bafybeidj76jdfaj7tsbl22plwgdcvhjkwtos33su2t6ieqw765zipm5mle?id=1\", \"properties\": {\"number\": 1, \"name\": \"Butterfly Haus Cannon Ball Figure\"}}"
