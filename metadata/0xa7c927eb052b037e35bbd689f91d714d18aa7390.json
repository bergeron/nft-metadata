    "description": "Take the futurism of mid-1990s graphic design, merged with the fake-nostalgia vaporwave of a reimagining of Win95, channeled through the lens of modern generative art and you get FALLiNGWATER. Swapping Jolt Cola for Green Tea, Coral Draw and Photoshop 2.5 for code and a single poster design for an infinite number of variations, Daniel digs back into what made him love graphic design in the first place for his entry to the Flatlands group show.",
