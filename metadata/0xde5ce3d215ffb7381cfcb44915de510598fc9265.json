    "description": "Once existed a green demon inside,\nTelling her stories of a deadly parasite.\nHer mind and body against her spirit conspired,\nHow could she survive the thought of suicide?\nHer wings of freedom had been roughly tied,\nSeemed she had to give up flying into the starry night.\nShe stretched her hands to the faraway light,\nBegged to take her soul and end this torturing fight.\nWith her eyes half closed, she saw a free white kite,\nShe smiled and closed her eyes with delight.\nIn the infinite sky, she saw her soaring and dancing from the heart,\nThe sky was her home and she was its only light.\n\nFree White Kite\nFaezeh",
