    "description": "Unexpected moment taken a few days after the end of lockdown in 2021, when I was finally able to explore again outside of my city borders.\nSo I've decided to go with a not planned exploration down to my memory lane. \n\nA town that I’ve reached after deciding for a last minute trip jumping on a train, I haven’t been there for quite a while.\nWandering around evokes memories and inspirations, just by looking at details on the buildings, the colors, sounds in little squares and streets, rumors say that it is older than Rome my hometown.\n\nSince the first time I’ve visited has been an important part of my photography journey and my storytelling development. Looking back at the image made me realize the role that has played and still does in the way I incorporate elements in the scene with the subject and the depth of my storytelling.\nBy revisiting it was great to relive in those memory lanes that are still inspiring me today.",
