    "description": "ostinato and quartal harmony pursue movement in a fatalistic way. This was created starting with a piano composition and then visualized using blender and octane. The purple rods are the notes from the sheet music. \n\nAs with every NFT minted in the Experience collection, Long Walk comes with a 4k video, sheet music, and performance footage. Please contact me on twitter @robmon2 to receive these. Also if a certain price is met, an in person private performance will be unlocked(within the continental United States). \n\n",
