Is this how it is intended or how it is to be? Do we seek redemption or need to justify the penance?\n\nI ponder still. \n\nA small glimpse into my own thought process, how I perceive my own actions, past and self. \nConvulted and broken, spiraling downwards into the mist of the light and the dark.\n\n\n1080x1080 | H264 |\nBlender | Photoshop | After Effects | ",
