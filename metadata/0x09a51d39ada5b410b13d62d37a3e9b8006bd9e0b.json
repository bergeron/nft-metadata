    "description": "A simple moment captured on the side of the road en-route to Utahs famed salt flats. Random photos like these are some of my favorites even though they usually aren't your plan A, these photos have a way of turning out almost as good, if not better than that original idea might have. The reason I'm such a fan of the random, rushed landscape photo is that I believe it really pushes your artistic instinct. Pulled off on the side of a busy freeway, I didn't have time to scout around and these clouds were absolutely stunning in the moment, so I photographed what was instantly appealing to me. Shooting in this way has always been quite entertaining, setting up compositions in a hurried manner that pushes your instincts to the limit and usually makes for quite a few really great images. \"Limitless\" is a representation of the best my artistic instinct can do. Hope you all enjoy! ",
