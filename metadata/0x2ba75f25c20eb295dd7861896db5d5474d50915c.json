    "description": "There are some moments that just stay with you. After years of chasing storms, this one still stands out above the rest. A cyclic supercell developed in southeast Montana on a muggy June evening. As it crossed into South Dakota a total of 8 tornadoes would descend from the clouds. This particular twister was not given a rating, because it was well behaved and stayed over open land. From a distance of 10 miles away the rotation of the storm at every level of the atmosphere was obvious. I definitely felt very small staring at this beast of a supercell. The sun had already set but there was just enough light remaining to shoot this time lapse.",
