    "description": "As creatives it's often assumed we have our \"head in the clouds\". For me personally, this can be true both physically and metaphorically.\n\nIn the physical there is nothing I love more than an early morning roadtrip in attempt to catch the rare sight of fog as it combines with first light. These mornings also help me to harness the metaphorical and keep my creativity alive.\n\nMy objective with this collection of images is to inspire more people to do the same... Get away from the daily grind of work, the cement of the city and of course, social media! Get outdoors, slow down and free your mind. Become a child again.",
