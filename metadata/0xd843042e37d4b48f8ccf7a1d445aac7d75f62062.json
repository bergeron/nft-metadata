    "description": "\"strange, strange world\" is a line from a song titled \"Master Jack\" composed by an obscure band from South Africa, Four Jacks & A Jill\n\nthe haunting yet airy vocals from the songs inspire me to come up with this illustration. Many theories surrounded the meaning of Master Jack's spooky-sounding song. I interpreted it in my own understanding\n\nMaster Jack could be a shaman? drug lord? guru? or perhaps a friend? I drew this with one of my best-friend in mind, a friend that was much older than I am. He opens up my mind to a lot of things from musics to comics, adidas jackets to cool t-shirts & most of all, love.\n\nMaster Jack (the friend) is thanked for being so kind at the end of the song, but \"i'd like to see the world through my own eyes\" came after that. So itâ€™s time to move on before Master Jack changes my mind.\n\nMaster Jack is a great song in my opinion and deserves a place in my song list & a visual for it :) \n\nDimension\n(digital): 3071px x 4344px | 300dpi\n(physical): 29.7cm x 42cm\n\n",
