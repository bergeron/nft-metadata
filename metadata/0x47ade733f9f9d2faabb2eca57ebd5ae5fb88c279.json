    "description": "Chinaâ€™s bitcoin miners use a mix of coal and hydroelectric power to power their miners, depending on the season. The use of coal in particular has drawn attention from the government, which is seeking to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nThe State Council of China, one of the highest government bodies in the country, told local governments to crack down on crypto mining and trading in May."
