    "description": "My prized 1/1 from a trip to Jamaica that will never be forgotten. I was welcomed into a world SO far from familiar, being introduced to various neighborhoods by my generous guide named Cornbread, a friend of the Marley family. The ability to witness & mingle in what otherwise would be VERY inaccessible as a white male tourist in Kingston is on another level of appreciation. Being brought to a misty village up in the hills during the harvest off-season, domino games (bones) are played with no end in sight. Barely surviving the drive up, hugging the left side of s-turns ripping up the cliffâ€™s edge, sipping on a Ting, to then have never seen a board with so much bounce, this moment was meant to happen. Everywhere I turned my gaze was a new scene of intrigue to capture. I left this little community with so much gratitude for its people. One Love ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²",
