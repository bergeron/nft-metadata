    "description": "\"The World that I Carry on My Shoulders\" portrays the emotional burden that we often carry within us. Life can be full of ups and downs, and we often end up holding onto negative emotions like sadness, anger, or fear, without even realizing it.\n\nWhen we accumulate these feelings, the sensation is that we are carrying an enormous weight that prevents us from moving forward. The painting shows a man with the globe resting on his back, symbolizing this burden."
