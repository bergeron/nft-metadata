    "description": "Unique NFT\n\n\"I love thunderstorms at the beginning of May,\" it was this poem by Tyutchev that my father told me every time as soon as a thunderstorm started.\n\nFor some people thunderstorms cause or evoke a feeling of fear, but for me thunderstorms are associated with warmth and a breath of fresh air.\n\nEvery time during a thunderstorm I remember cozy evenings with my family, how we would sit on the balcony, sod branches would knock against the window, thunder would thunder, and my dad and I would sit by the window in the dark with hot tea and count who would see more lightning.\n\nAnd after the thunderstorm we would go outside and breathe the fresh, cold air.\n\nThat's why I decided to paint a thunderstorm picture.",
