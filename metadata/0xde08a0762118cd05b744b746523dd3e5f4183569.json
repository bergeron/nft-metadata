    "description": "Only some days do we get to see this. It's hard to find a night with an intense enough solar storm and clear skies, but we were fortunate that day. We got them both. \n\nI had just moved to Lake Louise, waiting for a clear night so that I could go out to hunt for the night sky. \n\n7 pm, my phone rang... \"Hey, what are you up to?\" my friend said. It was the perfect time to shoot the Milky Way. \n\nThat's all it takes, I packed my cameras, jumped in a car, and we drove away. \n\nIt was cold. I wished I had brought extra layers. But a clear sky usually means a freezing night. \n\nClick.. click.. slowly, the moon disappears, and I can see the Milky Way spilling through the sky. Then there's something unpredictable happened. \n\nA rare phenomenon that's quite difficult to see that far south in Canada. The sky started to glow purple, and the sky turned into layers.\n\nLady Aurora had come around and danced right above us. \n\nWe were so excited and happy we didn't realise it was almost sunrise. \n\nThis was The Wicked Hunt chasing once-of-a-lifetime moments under the night sky.",
