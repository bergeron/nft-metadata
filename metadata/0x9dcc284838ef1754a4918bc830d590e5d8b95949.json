    "description": "A miserably cold and drab rainy a day in Boston's financial district in 2010 as commuters headed back to South Station to catch their trains home to the suburbs, there was one bright pop of color amongst all the grey.\n\nThis is part of my ongoing Umbrella Project, a personal photo project I have been doing for over 10 years.  Most people hate being out in the rain... I love it!  When it's raining I often head out with my camera gear and spend several hours wandering and standing around freezing moments in time as people juggle life with their umbrellas in the rain, and sometimes snow.",
