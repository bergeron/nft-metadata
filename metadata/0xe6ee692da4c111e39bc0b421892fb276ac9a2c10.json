    "description": "I am nothing, if not for the women that fought before me. They created the agency through which I now speak.Â \n\nThe world could not contain their magical agitation and called them WITCH.\n \nWitches do not come riding on brooms, they never did. Witches do not look bizarre or different. witches have always walked among us. \n\nWitches have long existed in the tales we tell about women with inner strength that can harm or heal.\nshe has been someone to fear, an uncanny Other who is unapologetically complex and dynamic in a world that prefers its women to be smiling and still.\n\nThis is a tribute to all those women who relentlessly fought for us in the past. The women who paved a path for us to be unapologetically ourselves. The women who taught us how to tap into our own might and magic, despite the many who try to strip us of our power.\n\nThis is for all the Witches I know and I wished to know.\n\n",
