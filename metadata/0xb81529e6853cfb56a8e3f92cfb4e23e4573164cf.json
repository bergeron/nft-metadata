    "description": "Fashion to many is a form of self-expression, to others, it is also a language of Art. The Nigerian Fashion has in time been known for its flamboyant style of expression that root back to ancient tribes who lived here centuries ago. \nIn the 60s, 70s and 80s, Nigerians, both men and women, were known to be fashionable, wearing unique attires and hairstyles.\n\nCity Girl Amaka portrays an elegant rendition of Vintage Nigerian fashion style that was prominent in young women back in the day.\n\nThe entire look was created by me specifically to celebrate the uniqueness of the style and to leave a soothing feeling of nostalgia.",
