    "description": "Urban geometric street photography is more about the beautiful surroundings than the people in the image. Yet, sometimes the people steal the show. \nThe architecture in the image by Santiago Calatrava is totally stunning, reflected in the still water that enhances the shapes and lines even more. \nThe camera was set up framing the architecture, all it needed was the right person to walk through the frame. After hours of shooting: people on bikes, groups of people, the odd single person walking across, the perfect scene appeared in front of me.\nTotally by chance this family walked through in the most perfect formation. As I was seeing the scene live I already knew the title and what it reminded me of. \nEvolution was born. \n\nValencia 2017\nExposure: 1/640 second at f/8\nISO: 100\nFocal Length: 50mm\nCamera: Nikon D810\nLens: Zeiss\nOther: Exhibited in London 2018 winning best in show\n",
