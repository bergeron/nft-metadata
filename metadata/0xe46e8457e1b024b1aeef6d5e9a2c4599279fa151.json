    "description": "『I am surrounded by complete darkness. I see nothing, I feel nothing. There is nothing here. I wonder why I am here? I wonder why I exist? I don’t even feel as though I am human anymore. It was as if I had turned into something else completely. Maybe I am just a monster. The only thing I am able to feel is pain. Why am I in pain? It hurts. I want it to stop. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to disappear. I wish I wasn’t even born in the first place.』\n\nThis artwork illustrates my experiences with mental illnesses, how much loneliness and despair I felt during the worst times of my life. Now that I've made it out alive and well, I hope to show others who might be going through what I did that they are not alone. And that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.",
