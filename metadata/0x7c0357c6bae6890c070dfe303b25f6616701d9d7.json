    "description": "Floating was first sold at \"To The Moon\" Auction by Bangkok Art Auction Center on 19 March 2022 for 95,000 Thai Baht (approximately 2,833 USD)\n\nPiece by Isr Upa-in, Sompot's son, that reminisces his late father's final masterpieces through photography and minute-to-detail styling. As an NFT, the graceful, romantic, yet melancholic brushstrokes breathe life into the figure and  truly brought into actuality.\n\nThe original painting, as of 2022, belongs to a private collection.",
