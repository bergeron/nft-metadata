    "description": "Georgia, Gudauri, February 2022.\n\n Every year in February I go to the mountains to snowboard, a trip to Georgia was an old dream, this year it came true.\n Incredible scale of nature, mountains of breathtaking beauty, height and strength.\n Honestly, with such immense mountains itâ€™s difficult to connect and be one. But it's worth trying your luck.\n\nSo cold, so majestic, so unattainable. And this cold beauty has always attracted me. I have a weakness for such impregnability, the more difficult the mountains, the deeper will be the discoveries about yourself.\n\n It is in the mountains that people hear themselves better than anywhere else, people become who they are.\n\n My favorite state in the mountains is the feeling of frosty freshness, the effort that you put in being there, the silence and that very moment of beauty that will never happen again.",
