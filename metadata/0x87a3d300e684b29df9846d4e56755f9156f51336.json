    "description": "Monika Ertl, daughter of a Nazi that fled to South America after the war, fell in love with a guerrillero.\n\nHe was hunted down and killed. She wrote a farewell letter to him „Christ with a gun, crucified by bullets“\n\nThe man responsible was promoted to consul in Hamburg, Germany. \nA few months later he was shot dead by a German looking visitor.\n\nBack home, Monika,  the „avenger of Ché Guevara“, was found, tortured and shot. \n\nThe traitor? An old friend of the family, secretly working for the CIA. \nKlaus Barbie, the butcher of Lyon.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis was found at the crime scene: https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSvMrudYCdQ9Egj8WWL1VQvueqL8L5udLExJtn9c4jAtP\n\nAnd I always thought it to be an incredibly powerful picture. \n\nFrom it, I crafted a totem. \n\nIn honor of all the women who struggle, and who nevertheless push through with unwavering courage and conviction.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nSound by Michael Akstaller",
