    "description": "Digital sunset explosion created from an original sunset photograph by Joanne Enders.\n\nWhose energy is that? I think I know. Its owner is quite angry though.\nShe was cross like a dark ocean. I watch her pace. I cry hello.\nShe gives her energy a shake, And screams I've made a bad mistake. The only other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.\nThe energy is eruption, wide and deep, But she has promises to keep, Tormented with nightmares she never sleeps. Revenge is a promise to keep.\nShe rises from her cursed bed, With thoughts of violence in her head, A flash of rage and she sees red. Without a pause I turned and fled.\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
