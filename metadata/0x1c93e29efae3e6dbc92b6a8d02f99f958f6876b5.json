    "description": "<p>Love it or hate it, F.U.D. (FUD) will always be a part of our cryptocurrency and NFT worlds. For those that aren't familiar, FUD is an acronym for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. It's the type of behavior, usually in written form, that can have a pretty strong affect on whether a cryptocurrency or NFT project is successful or not. On the flipside, more nefarious, weak, or even lazy projects tend to use it as an excuse to censor people from asking the 'wrong kind of questions'.</p> <p>This is a project of 9,999 CC0 NFTs that are intended as a bit of satirical commentary on today's crypto and NFT world. You can use these NFTs in any way that you wish, heck, you own them!</p>",
