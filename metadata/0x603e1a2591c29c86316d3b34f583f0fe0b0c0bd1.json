    "description": "The NFT elevates the classic genre to still life 2.0 â€” NZZ. This collection is an artistic collaboration between the globally renowned photographer Michael Wesely and Flowtys, creators of the first generative 'aging' NFT PFP collection. Together, they created still life NFT photography artworks which age on-chain. The flowers were captured by Wesely's unique ultra-long-exposure technique in 8 to 12 days exposure time each. Here, every minute a one minute long long-exposure image is being created and added to the previous minutes. The on-chain aging mechanism is made possible by Flowtys' smart contract, which changes the artworks' meta data as time passes. The nine individual flower NFTs come with Real Time Aging (about ten days for three limited edition 1/100 artworks), with Slowed Down Aging (one year for three open edition 1/TBD artworks) or with Accelerated Aging (eight hours for three unique 1/1 artworks).",
