    "description": "apparent thermal inertia (ATI) - An approximation of thermal inertia calculated as one minus albedo divided by the difference between daytime and nighttime\n\nachromatic vision - The perception by the human eye of changes in brightness, often used to describe the perception of monochrome or black and white scenes.\n\nangular resolving power -Minimum separation between two resolvable targets, expressed as angular separation.\n\natmospheric correction - Image-processing procedure that compensates for effects of selectivity scattered light in multispectral images.\n\nforward overlap - The percent of duplication by successive photographs along a flight line.\n\ngeostationary orbit - An orbit at 41 000 km in the direction of the Earth’s rotation, which matches speed so that a satellite remains over a fixed point on the Earth’s surface.\n\n",
