    "description": "The coast of the Black Sea in the Georgian city of Batumi pictured by Kirill Tarushkin (@tibetskoe_tango)\n\n\"It's nice to start the new year with a little trip, and it's unusual to see a sunny beach in early January. This is my first New Year's holiday spent in a place where snowy winter is rare.\n\nI took this photo on the way to the Park of Wonders. There is one of Batumi's main attractions — the mechanical sculpture Ali and Nino by sculptor and painter Tamara Kvesitadze. The figures of a man and a woman tend to each other, merge into a single whole for a short moment, and then, passing through each other, they separate again\"\n\nCamera — Fujifilm X-T10\nLens — XF18-55mm",
