The job of an artist is not easy. I chose this to find my path and inspiration. I want to find something more, my purpose and meaning in life, something that will get me out of bed every day and go out into the world. I'm a little excited, so let's walk this road together.\"\n\nDigital work done by hand in Procreate.",
