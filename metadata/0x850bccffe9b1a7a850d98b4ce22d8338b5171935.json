    "description": "1st in a series of unretouched, long-exposure photographs. \n\nEach photo depicts a light(s) on a decaying pendulum letting nature reveal the beautiful patterns only visible through exposures often minutes long.\n\nManipulating one or multiple variables can change the photos dramatically, resulting in uniqueness to each revealed pattern and subsequently to each future release.",
