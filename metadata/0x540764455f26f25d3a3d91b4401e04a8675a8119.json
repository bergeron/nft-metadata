    "description": "With Enough Luv, we decided to steer away from the usual Pop/R&B world we tend to live in and take a risk. Taking risks is what web3 is all about so for this one we took a more Alt Pop Rock approach. \n\nThis song is about giving your all for love but never getting that same amount of commitment back. Sometimes it can feel like the end of the world when your efforts aren't appreciated in love and we wanted to highlight that in this song!",
