    "description": "The first life moment translated into its metaweave becomes the firstborn of this series. \n\nSource: It’s a bright, windy morning by the Ionian Sea. The camera moves over enchanting blue waves, restless in the wind, glittering through lush vegetation, saluting the sun in pale green and brown nightgowns. It’s breakfast time. For a moment, the camera slides over the wooden tables, where the plates will soon be set. The breath is filled with sea, wind, June and caramelized coffee aroma. Everything will be fine. \n\nPlay with audio.\n\nEach metaweave represents a translation of the colors, energy, emotion, feeling and dynamics in the video, a poetic recreation of the scene in the parallel universe of the web, as data tapestry. The colors are the original colors of the video and one of the metaweaving variables is the raw audio. The result reflects both image and sound, and becomes a perpetual and unforeseen weave, just like life is an endless tapestry, both random and synchronic.\n",
