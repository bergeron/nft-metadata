    "description": "I wrote The Song of The Sun & The Moon during the making of my new album \"33\". I was alone in the woods in Ithaca, NY across from the Dali Lama's Namgyal Monastery watching the sun set with a small acoustic guitar. My nephew had just been born and I was reflecting on my own journey so far. I had just been dropped from a major record label, and had been largely unsuccessful in terms of making a living as an artist, but I felt a peace about it all in that moment. I was proud of myself.\n\nI thought about the lullabies my parents would sing me as a child. My mom would sing Joni Mitchel or John Denver, and my dad would make up his own little songs. Their songs are so ingrained in me, even as I write this. In some way, I wrote The Song of The Sun & The Moon as a lullaby to myself, from myself. It reminds me that every night I die, and every morning I am reborn. \n\nThat is the song! And it goes on. I don't know if it will ever be finished.\n",
