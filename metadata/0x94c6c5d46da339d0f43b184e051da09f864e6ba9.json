    "description": "About: When we were kids, learning to ride bicycles was one of the most pleasant memories we have ever had. When the position is sitting on a bicycle, and starting to try to pedal, slide and fall, because the spirit wants to be able to, then get up again and keep trying again. At that time, inside us mixed feelings of fear, sadness, worry, joy, anger and so on. However, we turned out to ignore all these feelings, because we believe we can, optimistic and soon we can play bicycles, have fun with friends.\n\nYear: 2010 \n\nLocation: Belitung Island, Bangka Belitung - Indonesia\n\nEdition: 1/1 \n\nFile: 2000 × 3008px JPG 300dpi\n\nArtist: Ade Santora\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
