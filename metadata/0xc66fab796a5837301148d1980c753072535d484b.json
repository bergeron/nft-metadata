    "description": "There are moments in life-both spiritual and intellectual—that are like no other. They change us. They redirect us. They complete us. Between these moments of Enlightenment—all of which are relatively rare—we simply go from one life event, one change point, to another. But after such times of acute insight, life takes on a different hue.\n\nI drew this painting based on the enlightenment that happened to me.\nName: Modern Odyssey \n size : 4606 * 5669 px",
