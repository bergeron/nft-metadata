    "description": "Taiyō no Uta - Ensoleillé Pleasure Boat means a journey Into The Sun. \n\nWhat’s better than cruising the Kawaguchi lake at sunset with Mount Fuji in the background? Happily  fly over it while all elements align at the perfect moment. Although it was a freezing cold afternoon and i could barely control the drone. \n\nAs a 3,776 meters giant, Mount Fuji it's special for all it's meaning a for being one of the most important symbols in Japanese culture. Pilgrims have been climbing the mountain as a show of religious piety for generations. \n\nNowadays religion plays a less important role to the ones who climb it, but for sure the hikers who make the trip up the mountain resonate with this volcanoes timeless importance.",
