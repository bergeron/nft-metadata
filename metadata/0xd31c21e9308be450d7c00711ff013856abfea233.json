    "description": "This audio-visual artwork explores the ideas related to perception and thinking process - how words we use become our thoughts and our thoughts shape how we perceive the world. Essentially, the thoughts become the house one lives in. By providing a meditative experience, the artist asks the viewers to forget about the vocabulary and open themselves to feelings. One doesnâ€™t need words to be able to feel joy or to experience calmness.\n\nMusic by Michael Askill.\n\nThe collector will receive a high-res file of this artwork.\n\nDimension: 1920px x 1920px",
