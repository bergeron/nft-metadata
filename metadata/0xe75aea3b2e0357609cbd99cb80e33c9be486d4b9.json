    "description": "Frances Farmer was one of the most gifted, resilient, and brave women of Hollywood. Farmer had run-ins with the law and faced institutionalization against her will. Often termed as \"The Original Hollywood Bad Girl\", Frances survived back-to-back heartbreak, betrayal, and abuse. \n\nUsing her remarkable strength, coupled with an undeniable talent, Farmer was able to climb out of the darkness and shine like the gem she was. She was a gentle soul that cared about society's problems to the point it often troubled her very deeply. \n\nFarmer shook the world. \n\nRead the full story via my website.\n\nHollywood Gems Collection:\nhttps://gypsymermaid.art/hollywood-gems-collection\n\nFarmer was the inspiration for the Hollywood Gems Collection.\n\n*20% of funds from this sale will be donated to the American Cancer Society in Farmerâ€™s honor.\n\nNFT Details: 4096 x 4096 300 DPI Lossless PNG Image",
