    "description": "Youth, My Friend - 2.0 - 7 Aug 2022\n\nWhen I was a child, I couldn't wait to become an adult. Adults can make decisions, people listen to them and take their words seriously, adults can do anything whenever they want without first having to explain themselves and justify their reasons why. \n\nBut now that I'm older, I lament the days of my youth. Some were stolen from me, some I took for granted and some I just didn't take full advantage of. It was easier to believe in life's possibilities without the fear of failure. Life was much more simpler when I had little to no responsibilities. Back when my zest for life wasn't marred by the trauma, failures, callous choices and their consequences.\n\nOh but I look forward to the future with a richer passion. I choose to remain a visionary - a dreamer. \n\nI have found that youth is a state of mind and Youth is my friend.  \nRemain young at heart and step boldly into your future.\n\nBe determined and persevere, friend.",
