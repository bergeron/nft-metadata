    "description": "About 77 m high, the tower known as ”Romanita”, on the edge of Valea Trandafirilor Park, used to be the tallest building in Chisinau. The cilinder-shaped tower includes four levels of utilities (washing and drying rooms, cleaner’s, domestic facilities) and 16 residential levels. The two uppermost floors were designed as a sightseeing platform, with a sunbathing area. The two underground levels contain technical spaces. Obturated by new buildings rising on plots that used to be public property, the tower is earmarked for demolition in the next 10 years, City Hall public servants say. The process of listing it as a monument, launched in 2016 by B.A.C.U., whose members often strive to describe it as a symbol of Chisinau, has produced no effects so far.",
