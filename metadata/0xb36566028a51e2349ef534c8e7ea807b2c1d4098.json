    "description": "The muse is something intangible that hovers in the air, sometimes elusive, but something beautiful. I imagined the muse as streams of light around us while we create.  In these photos is the real artist Lida Zheleznyak known as LiandeArt. I was lucky enough to visit her studio, where she turns inspiration into beautiful paintings.",
