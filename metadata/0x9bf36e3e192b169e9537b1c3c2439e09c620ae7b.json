    "description": "I recently drew Shervin Hajipour, the talented musician who won the Grammy Award for Best Music for Social Change. I incorporated some relevant elements such as the Grammy trophy, a cat, and a Vans sticker. I have always admired Shervin not only for his incredible talent but also for his kind-hearted personality and for being a voice for Iranians. It was an honor to create this artwork and pay tribute to such an inspiring artist.",
