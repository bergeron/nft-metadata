    "description": "How finished is good enough? How unfinished is too bad to be shared?\n\nAnd if there is no need to be too good to be excellent, why don't we celebrate the unfinished? Why aren't museums, art galleries, filled with sketches? True sketches or copies of them.\n\nWhy do we value the static and limited state of the finished, compared to the high potential of evolution hidden within the unfinished?\n\n\"Dare\" celebrates the beauty of the process. It epitomizes the fact that deeply woven into imperfection, there are thin but strong strands of perfection.\n\nIt is an exploration. A series of attempts at taming the brightest shades that pulsate through the skin of the deepest shadows.\n\nFind a region on this territory that beats in sync with your vibration, and make it yours.\n\n-\n\nPNG - 2456 x 3484px\nPencil on A4 paper.\n4th Nov. 2022\n\nFinished version of this drawing will be part of the \"Smooth Chronicles\" on the OBJKT.COM platform.",
