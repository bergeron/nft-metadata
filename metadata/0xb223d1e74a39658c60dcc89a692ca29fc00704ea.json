    "description": "A photograph of Mt. Bancroft towering above Loch Lomond at sunrise in the Colorado Rockies.\n\nIt was taken during an incredibly cold and windy morning. The entire process was a struggle, from hiking through knee deep snow in the dark, to being literally blown off my feet by the wind and taking shelter in a rock outcropping until sunrise. \n\nIt was at that point, after all the struggle, I was gifted with the most majestic sunrise I had ever seen. Sharp rock faces gnawing on a cotton candy sky.\n\nI feel this piece epitomizes the theme of my photography work. Solitude, The struggle of life way high up, and the beauty of the sunlit hills as the reward.",
