But the two ideal components of the picture for me personally still have a miraculous nature - this is the sky and snow. Otherwise, any little thing can hook me - a spot, a line, proportions. That is why comrades in orange vests appeared, because they are like bullfinches in the urban landscape. There is a gray sky, white snow and these bullfinches.",
