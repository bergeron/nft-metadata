    "description": "Where is the beginning… where is the end…\t\t\t\t\t\nWithin life, we do not diminish, we do not increase… we just relocate… transform … renew…\t\t\t\t\t\nThe only changing entity… time?\t\t\t\t\t\nIs a human life a whole thing that will repeat the same way from the beginning to the end?\t\t\t\t\t\nWhere do “lives” overlap and crisscross in this cycle?\t\t\t\t\t\nCan we notice at what point we are in the cycle?\t\t\t\t\t\nDo we respect this cyclical nature of life enough?\t\t\t\t\t\nCan we show “the endless moment” in a photograph?\t\t\t\t\t\nI created this photo project to explore these questionings.\t\t\t\t\t\nGiving a cyclical format to experienced moments, I made the concept of time vanish…\t\t\t\t\t\nI want to the viewer to notice all their life  and the time, and question it inside the black and white circles I have created looking at the lives inside them…\t\t\t\t\t\nThe stories I narrated have no beginning and no end.\t\t\t\t\nWith the magical power of the  “photograph”,  I managed to see the cycle, and to show it.",
