This couldn’t be further from the truth. While living on the street, I became intimately familiar with public bathrooms as places of refuge and reprieve. Years later, I came to appreciate their strange and varied beauty while exploring the US. Bathrooms are curious places gathering relics of use and shits taken. They’re a bundle of contradictions: personal and communal, sacred and irreverent, aesthetic and utilitarian.",
