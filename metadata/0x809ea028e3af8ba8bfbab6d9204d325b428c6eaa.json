    "description": "The Russians are trying to take away the parts of other countries territories. This is how the Russians are paralysing these countries, hanging concrete blocks on them and turning them into cripples and slaves.\n\nProject Takeover is about the cynicism and violence that Russians show towards Ukrainians, trying to take away their freedom.\n\nA crazy maniac violently takes away another person's body part, brazenly declaring that this body part does not belong to him. The occupation of Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, etc. is the same as taking away another person's body part.\n\n40% of the earned money will be donated to help Ukraine. \n1/1 Unique piece.
