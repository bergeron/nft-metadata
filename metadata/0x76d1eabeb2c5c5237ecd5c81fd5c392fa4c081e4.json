    "description": "Epiphany, reaching that place where time is suspended and emotion materializes. Those non-daily feelings are revealed, I like to call them that, these feelings that make me rethink where I come from, who I am and what I have done. \nTime is suspended but that stampede still comes out, inaugurating a void between those two worlds \"the past and the future\". My present is sometimes an emptiness that I have to fill every day trying not to die trying. \n\nThe liquid epiphany, the temporality of time that notices those empty spaces, thanks to the experience of the lived, its territorial instant. \n\nThe time that stops there without ceasing to pass and I feel it as something lasting and at the same time fleeting in the same chord, immortal and ephemeral at the same time, of the timeless with the linear time and of the emptiness with the space, point of departure and arrival.\n\nWho am I? is it an epiphany?\n\nAcrylic painting on wood\n\n*Does not include the physical work",
