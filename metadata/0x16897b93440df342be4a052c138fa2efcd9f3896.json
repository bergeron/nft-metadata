    "description": "“No sense” is the first song I made the “with friends” EP, and kind of kicked off the whole concept for me. Andrew Bates is a super talented vocalist and artist who I came across on Tiktok, and knew right away I wanted to do something with him. \n\nI sent him a few ideas- and he sent me back this vocal.   Immediately I connected with the writing… it’s got this feeling of longing that I thought just felt so right. “California’s a waste of time, but drought sounds nice” is such a beautiful sentiment to me. I hope you all love it as much as I do <3 ",
