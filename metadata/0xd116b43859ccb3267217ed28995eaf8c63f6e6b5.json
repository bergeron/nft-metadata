    "description": "mental health..........\nThe best way to clear your mental health is to immerse yourself in nature........\nThis is a story of an adventure where i met this man lost in time,Around July 2021 i traveled  to a community in taguai Niger state,Nigeria, the wind was really calm, one could feel the calm cold penetrating deep into ones bones, which created a strong misty fog, walking along the edge of the lake, i saw this man sitting at the middle of the lake in this tiny canoe, at first I thought he was fishing but when I actually looked trough my lens(zoom in) I saw him just sitting there thinking…. and thinking…and thinking  we where there for roughly  2 hours but he never left that spot, we had to leave so I unfortunately didn’t get to meet him to hear his story, but this remains me on how every one of us has this one thing that keeps us awake at night…what is that one thing that keeps you?",
