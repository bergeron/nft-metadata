    "description": "The Oak Fire was the most devastating fire in California this year and left 100s of families without homes and left animals burned or abandoned - all of this in the IRL community surrounding Happy Goat. 100% of the funds raised will be donated to the families or to providing care for the animals affected. Lets show the world that web3 can be used for good! \n\n Everyone participating will get a unique Relief Happy Goat NFT, inclusion in Phase II genesis pass minting, and an additional limited edition NFT (depending on donation tier level).",
