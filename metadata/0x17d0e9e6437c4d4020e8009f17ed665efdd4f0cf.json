    "description": "Arriving in Yosemite prior to a snowstorm is such an incredible experience.  It was snowing this night and I got to enjoy this cold with a few other photographers.  Hands cold, face cold and I will always do it 10 times out of 10.  \n\nI will send another NFT photo from this trip upon purchase.  ",
