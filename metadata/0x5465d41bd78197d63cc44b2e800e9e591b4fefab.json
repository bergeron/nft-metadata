    "description": "Moraine Lake is one of the most famous lakes in the world and for good reason. I spent a month in the Banff area in September 2018, my jaw seldom leaving the ground. In total I spent nearly a week's worth of mornings at Moraine Lake and the surrounding areas looking for unique photos. \n\nAfter a sunrise hike above Moraine, I walked down to the main viewing area and saw this couple paddling out onto the lake in the midmorning sun. I had just enough time to get my camera out and take two frames before they dipped into shadows. It's not every day you get a completely unique photograph of such a popular place but this was one of those days for me.",
