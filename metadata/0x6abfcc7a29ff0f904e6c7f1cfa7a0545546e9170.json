    "description": "This is the 1st photo in the collection that is released as a 1/1 unique edition. Size: 5600x7000 px\n\nA wild secret beach in Bali that can only be accessed at low tide of the ocean.\n\nImagine that you only have a few hours to find yourself on a deserted, pristine beach, because you can't get to it at high tide, because the ocean floods that narrow piece of land among the rocks that you can walk on.\n\nTo get there sometimes you have to wade, sometimes walk on the bare ocean bottom with corals, a little climb over huge boulders, which broke away from the rock and blocked the way to the beach, in these boulders live crabs, which funny run away from you in the narrow slits between the stones.\n\nYou walk along the rocks, wrapped in dense greenery, all alone. Not a single footprint on the sand, you're alone with the sound of the ocean waves crashing, birds singing, the crunch of sand under your feet.",
