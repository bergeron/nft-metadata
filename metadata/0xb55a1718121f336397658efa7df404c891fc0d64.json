Suited to information gathering, they could also be tasked with assassination due to their ability enter areas of a castle or a Daimyo's encampment that were heavily fortified.\n\n'Kunoichi' is AI art created through several iterations, and altered for composition/color and then animated.\n\nFormat: GIF \nSize: 1000x1000 - 2.04MB",
