    "name": "Vanity",
    "description": "Vanity is often a vice associated with women. Society often reduces women's worth to their looks. This again comes from the idea of women's bodies being commodities. Conventionally attractive women statistically do better than those not deemed attractive enough for beauty standards at the time. Women who's natural appearance does not align with the thin, feminine, eurocentric standards of beauty such as women of color, fat women or trans women pressurized to hyper feminise their appearance to try & keep up with the social hierarchies. Women who don't care much about their appearance are seen as lazy & incompetent. Women who do care about how they look are seen as vain. This is a classic case of \"damned if you do, damn if you don't\".\n\n----\n\n3500 x 3500px\n300 DPI\nHand painted on iPad\nÂ©TheDarkRayne",
