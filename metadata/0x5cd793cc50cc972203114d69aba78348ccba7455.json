    "description": "Summer was almost gone and we were headed into Autumn;  \nIt felt like the proper occasion to mint a new kind of personal project I’ve “worked” on during my lonely Summer 2020 in town.  \nIt’s called “Still+Sound” because it combines together photography and field recording audio, automatically turning the whole thing into a video.  \nI really love how things mix quite seamlessly together and the output it generates, it really brings me back there where I shot the picture and it feels good. Not sure why but it does. I guess it’s a kind of “Madeleine moment”.  \nI took the photos with both my Canon AE1 and my Olympus Mju, I only wish I didn’t used some crappy expired films but I’ll eventually learn from mistakes.  \nThis is the very first episode of the project, the following one will be created once the previous has been collected.  \nAnyway, thank you for reading this far and I hope you liked the video.\n\nStill+Sound #1: “Un’Estate fa” (\"One Summer ago\").  \nSize: 1080 × 1920  \nMedium: Film photography + Audio recording  \nEdition: 1/1",
