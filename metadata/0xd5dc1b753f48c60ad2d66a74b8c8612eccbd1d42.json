    "description": "An air of melancholy surrounded her \ncaused by an ongoing inner battle of her heart threatening to break.\nWhile no one else even cared or took notice, a flower grew from the darkness, \nproving natureâ€™s laws wrong.\nIt kept on growing without any sunlight or any nurturing \nand after a while one flower started to become many flowers.",
