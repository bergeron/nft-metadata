    "description": "Mind-soul-body, birth-life-death. Genesis.\n\nThere are 3 important circles in this piece representing the omen of creativity, optimism, and curiosity, forming a trinity. \nThe intention I put behind the circle is important in itself, the never ending pursuit of a circle, once created will never stop; the only option is to continue the 360 degree rotation. This all ties into the main subjectsâ€™ uneasy pose, not quite sure which direction to go, grounded by shapes and connected by arm. The colors, and additional elements add reassurance and support. \n\nAlbeit, this is my interpretation, which I realized after completion of the piece. I had no concrete direction going into this piece, I trusted intuition and this is the conclusion: Explore, find your own interpretation.",
