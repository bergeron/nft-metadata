    "description": "The work seeks to convey the sensation of nature imposing itself, on a social situation of an exploratory journey in one of the last Colombian glaciers at 5.300 meters over sea level. But, above all, the photograph shows this species from the bottom of the snowy sea, but which we know is in the jungle in the FARCs territory. That, plus the fact that it is a monochrome image, makes the characters in the photograph meet at an indeterminate point, thus enriching the perception of the image.",
