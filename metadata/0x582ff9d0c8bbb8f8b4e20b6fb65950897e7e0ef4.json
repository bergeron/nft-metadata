    "description": "I’ve visited Iceland around 15 times in the past 7 years. \nSometimes alone and sometimes together with clients on my workshops.  And on every visit I also went to this magical place. \nI never saw something like this somewhere else on this Planet. It is one of those landscapes which made Iceland so unique.  \nI saw this place on sunrise, on sunset, with northern lights or just gray, but never a mood like in this picture.  \nThis day was something really special. The Sunset was quite ok. Not the most colorful one, but also not bad. \nBut then happened the magic. \nRight after sunset we realized that the moon is rising and this, in combination with the last colors from the blue hour, created this magic atmosphere.  \nIt was one of these moments you never ever forget in your entire life.  One of the most unique places on earth, covered in this soft moonlight and in the background the colors from the blue hour. \nNothing can beat this feeling.
