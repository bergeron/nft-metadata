    "description": "The tragedy of Russia’s war in Ukraine is known around the world. This piece- which is inspired by Banksy’s subversive use of graffiti to protest and Fairey’s accessible imagery- is the second in a series of Anti war posters I’ve created to raise money for the Ukraine crisis. I wrote the phrase “what if we loved” because I was thinking about how different the world would be if everyone just loved. I really like how this piece came out chaotic but i think it's cohesive.  \n \nThe Ukraine 1 Hryvnia banknote from 2014 is comprised of 30 uncut pieces with yellow and blue colors featuring the coat of arms, the Grand Prince of Kyiv, Vladimir the Great, ax, and sword.  \n",
