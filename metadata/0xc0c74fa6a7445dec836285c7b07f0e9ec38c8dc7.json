This Pepestein was finally rendered into an image.\n\nIt is actually an augmented reality nft, so the owner of this NFT will be able to own the 3d modelled pepestein in glb format from the \"HASH\" printed in the image. It doesn't require any application to simulate the augmented reality. Just scan the Qrcode and open the url which starts the web version of AR app which can be used to scan the Pepestein image to simulate the augmented reality of the animated Pepestein.\n\nItems included:\n1) Pepestein rendered image\n2) Pepestein 3d model",
