    "description": "\"Reach\" is a painting I made in early 2020 and has a similar meaning to my painting \"Without Fear.\" This image at that time was kind of a message to myself to keep pushing forward despite some of the ways I was feeling the year prior. Darkness can creep into your life or come suddenly, so this painting for me is meant to be a reminder of that; To have gratitude even when things get left behind. Although there is suffering in life, we will continue to move forward.\n\nThe original artwork is 24\"x36\"inches.
