    "description": "Growing up in a city like Tehran ,surrounded by multiple constructions, led me to architectural photography and understanding much more about perspectives.\nWhile I’ve always felt homesick, I tried to change the way I see it and made my own kind of view. Realizing the way how colors affect, I made a special “BLUE”, mixed it with the atmosphere and produced everything much more loyal to my thoughts. ",
