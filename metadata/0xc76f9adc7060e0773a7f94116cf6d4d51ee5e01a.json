    "description": "Fueled by a desire to bring meditative movements to the digital world, I have created 5 unique 1/1 NFT’s inspired by my process based artwork. This is my genesis NFT, \"Mindscape 5:55 pm\". The forms you see floating were made with latex + spray paint; manipulated with wind, heat and gravity to create texturized forms inspired by visions seen while cloud spotting. \n\nThe goal: levitate your mind, give it space to breathe, and meditate on your “Mindscape”. Each “Mindscape” was color coded to match the atmospheric shade during its titled time. \"Mindscape 5:55 pm\" ushers in a calming coral hue that closes out the day in peace.\n\nYour NFT will be paired with a custom, 8 x 10 inch physical piece of artwork called a \"Meditation Study\". “Meditation Studies” are made by pouring thick layers of latex paint over several days; creating textural ripples, drips and droops.\n\n30 FPS.  25 sec. 2674 x 2160\n\nMore on Mindscapes: <https://artistreneephillips.com/nft> ",
