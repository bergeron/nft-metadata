    "description": "This artwork is a depiction of my greatest fear... time.\nThe fear of time passing, of insufficient time and what time brings, like old age and sickness. There is a countdown for each and every one of us and we have no idea how close or far to the end we are. If we remember that, then maybe we will be able to cherish life by living in the moment.",
