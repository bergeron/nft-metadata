    "description": "As most of you know, I joined this space over 2 years ago with a single goal in mind: Make a Genuine Positive Impact. \n\nI hope I’ve done a decent job but I’m most proud of the people I’ve met along the way. \n\nToday I’m excited to share the release of my first digital collectible entitled ‘Moose World’. It is the first edition of a larger series with expansion plans through 2024. \n\nI did my best to make minting affordable.  \nIt's only open for 24 hours. \n\nAlso, I want to give a huge shoutout to my animator, Bozo, who helped make this project come to life.",
