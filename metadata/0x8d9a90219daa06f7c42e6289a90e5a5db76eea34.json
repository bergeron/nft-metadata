    "description": "A collaboration between @MickeyFalzone & @ApricotBlossomD\n\nFrance, Provence, Valensole, 4th Jul 2015\n\nOnly the buzzing sound of the bees was breaking the silence, thousands of them amongst the rows of lavender.\n\nThe surreal glow of the lantern looked beautiful on Danila’s face and this night view of Valensole has always been one of my favorites.\n\nOn top of Michele’s image Marion added a textured frame made with A.R, elements of a constellation sky, hand painted Moon flowers and a Luna moth.\n\nMoon flowers symbolize blossoming in dark times, potential growth of our personality when faced with the hardship of our lives.\n\nThe nocturnal Luna moth represents our need to “find the light” a symbolic quest for truth and knowledge, intuition and increased awareness.\n\nThe color white in the elements represents purity, innocence, goodness, light and natural elegance.\n\nThis NFT comes with special unlockable augmented reality content to be released only to the 1st owner at the end of the auction.",
