    "description": "Nick Johnson, AKA \"Nick.eth\" is the founder and lead developer of the \"Ethereum Name Service\" - https://app.ens.domains\n\nSoon after I got introduced to ENS back in 2021, I realised that there was so much more utility hidden below the surface layer of what this Web3 Protocol offers. \n\nUsing my curiosity and love of Art, Tech and Blockchain development, I naturally wanted to test the extremes of what was possible...\n\nThis Artwork is a 1of1 NFT, a result of many many hours experimenting with using Emojis to formulate ENS (.eth) Domain combinations, that when displayed on the correct screen size/format produce this new and revolutionary artistic style.\n\nMy plan is to continue exploring the possibilities within this new dimension of Web3 Art. I hope you will enjoy this journey with me into the Metaverse!\n\nHowever, the question still remains - Is this Art or a Domain ? \n\nðŸ¤”ðŸ™‚ðŸ’¡\n\n\n\n",
