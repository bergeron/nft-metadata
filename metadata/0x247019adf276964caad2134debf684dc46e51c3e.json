    "description": "May you always remember the magic within. Sometimes we need things to fall apart to build back up again and thrive in ways we've never imagined. Honoring all my journeys of falling apart and coming together again.\n\nThis AI-assisted art was inspired by my healing journeys with psychedelics and listening to Los Wemblers de Iquitos, a legendary psychedelic cumbia band from Iquitos, the capital of the Amazon in Peru. If you haven't heard of them, listen to Sonido Amaz√≥nico."
