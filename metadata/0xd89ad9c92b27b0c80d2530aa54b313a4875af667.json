    "description": "By far the picture that stands out more in the collection, as it's unique for so many reasons: it's the only one captured with a wide angle lens, the only one with the sky in the frame, the only one that at the same time is showing more of the vast landscape but also less for the effect used. To create this particular \"painting\" effect I've used some vaseline on the lens, so that I would lose details and textures on the foreground.\n\nI had this image in my head for a long time and it was a pleasure to see that finally I managed to capture something that I was proud of!",
