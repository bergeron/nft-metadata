    "description": "«Body language» is pure beauty without words. This is my first collection in such format, because I have never photographed people naked before. The first attempts were to curb the shyness between me and the model, and now it's about the emphasis on strong and individual things - scars, moles, non-model figure and everything that is natural, but not good for most of society. In general, this is a very interesting experience, because if a person undresses in front of the camera - it means that he trusts me, and for me it is very important. It's about some special intimacy, about what we hide behind the curtain.",
