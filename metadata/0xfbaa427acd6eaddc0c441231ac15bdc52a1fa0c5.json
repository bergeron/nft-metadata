    "description": "It is said that life originated in water. And everything that water created, we see now.  \nThe nautilus is considered to be one of the first mollusks, which have existed for more than 450 million years. The shell of the nautilus, covered with nacreous, \"grows\" throughout its life - which is why the nautilus has become a symbol of growth and renewal. And its spiral creates the development of life. Even in Hindu mythology, the nautilus was a symbol of many aspects of creation. It is also a symbol of the inner beauty of nature. The shell of the nautilus is one of the famous natural objects symbolizing the golden ratio, which is truly unique and perfect in its nature",
