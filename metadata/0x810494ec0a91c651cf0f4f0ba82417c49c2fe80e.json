    "description": "PRIMA MATERIA\n\nIn my series I would like to explore these levels of thought in the urban-ideological existence of Budapest. In the projection of Aldo Rossi's \"urban artifact\" theory on the city, we see that any urban element (building, square, river, bridge, mountain, sculpture, road, boulevard, etc.) that is a temporal, spatial, mental reference point - is also an \"urban artifact\". This starting point is of particular interest to me in the case of new housing estates on a long term scale, for which in many cases no spatial elements have been created, but inherited, Roman, medieval or even World War II ruins and monuments.\n\n\nIt is interesting to know how the built environment relates to, integrates or ignores these elements, or whether it is possible to intervene in an urban fabric that is already 30-60 years old with such inherited objects, or even with new objects that reflect them. Can they be used to start new stories and/or continue old ones?\n\n",
