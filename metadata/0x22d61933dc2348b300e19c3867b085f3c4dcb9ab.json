His magic brings clouds into the sky, and trees start to come upside down from the sky. A garden inhabited by various creatures emerges as the trees touch the ground. Animals appear from here and there, fairies gather around the fountain, and flowers bloom on the trees and ground.\n\nThe prompt was chosen for the mood of the night garden and the theme involving \"mystical creatures.\" AI was not used in the process. The rough sketch was done on paper; the rest of the artwork was done in photoshop.",
