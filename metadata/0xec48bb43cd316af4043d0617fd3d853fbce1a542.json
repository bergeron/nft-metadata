    "description": "Space Cowboys are a group of intergalactic warriors who have come to Earth to save humanity from the threat of rogue artificial intelligence and SkyNet. They are skilled riders and adept with advanced technology, making them the perfect fighters to take on the machines of SkyNet. They are rugged, determined, and unafraid of danger, willing to risk everything to save humanity. Instead of advanced space ships, they ride on powerful, high-tech horses that have been genetically and cybernetically enhanced to provide them with superhuman strength and speed. These horses are also equipped with advanced weapons and technology, making them a formidable force against SkyNet's machines. The goal of the Space Cowboys is to end the threat of SkyNet, and restore peace and safety to Earth.",
