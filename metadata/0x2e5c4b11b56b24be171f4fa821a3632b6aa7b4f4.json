    "description": "I am from Iran. For me, in this country, everything is left half-finished. The disintegration of a person under the influence of an unknown environment creates a vague and indeterminate feeling in me.\n\n\"Mehdi Hokmfarmaei BW Iran\" series was filmed within a year (2010).\n\nThis collection includes 50 street images, all of which have just been documented after about 11 years without any manipulation.\n\n\nA negative physical version will be sent to any collector who buys each piece above 1 ETH.",
