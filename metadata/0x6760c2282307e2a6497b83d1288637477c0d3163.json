    "description": "The artwork depicts a woman cutting an organism with a scalpel, symbolizing a freedom act against controlling systems and societal pressures. \n\nThe wall behind the woman reads \"Protect the Unity\" in the blood of the organism, serving as a response to George Orwell's \"Big Brother is watching you\" slogan. \n\nThe pills in the woman's hand represent personal freedom and willpower, encouraging individuals to resist societal pressures. The artwork invites viewers to embrace the power of individuals to change and influence society.",
