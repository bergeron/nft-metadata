    "description": "Title: The Spike \nEdition: 1/1\nVertical panorama made of 4 stitched images.\nAttached file: 3746 x 5288 pixels \n\nStory: The limit of Maderia’s most easterly point. A ten kilometre spike of volcanic coastline dating back millions of years. \n\nThis image was taken on an incredible sunrise shoot during a 6 hour hike. The geology and land mass is incredible. Kilometres long and in places it is only a few metres wide. One wrong step and that would be the end.\n\nThe scale of this place blew me away. These were some of the largest cliffs I have ever hiked, it filled me with awe. The contrast of basalt rock with layers of red clay, vibrant greens and stormy oceans below was a joy to behold as the sun crept over the horizon and broke through the clouds to light the dramatic landscape.\n\nMy drone allowed me to get a unique perspective of the cliffs, one that I couldn’t have experienced from the ground.  Using the shape of the landscape to lead you right to the light at the end. ",
