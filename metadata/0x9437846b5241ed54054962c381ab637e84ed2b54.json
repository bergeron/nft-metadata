    "description": "On May 9, 2022, Zagabond made a sad attempt to valorize his path to presumed Azuki glory. He presented an uncompelling vision of Web3 in which builders manipulate communities through false promises and fake friendships in the name of \"learnings.\"  \n\nThis mint memorializes that failure and shrinks the image to 10% of the original to represent his lack of value to society. \n\nWe can do better than Zagabond.  We will do better than Zagabond. ",
