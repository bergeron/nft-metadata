    "description": "SKULLEROK is a community starting with 9630 dead people came back to life with an advanced consciousness from the fifth dimension of the realm of the dead. Owning SKULLEROK gives you access to the portal of the conscious community, which refuses to join the herd, and to be one of the liberated people from the miserable society that is monopolized by a small group of people. In this way, you are sending a sign to the world and expressing your rejection to the matrix that does not serve the people, but serves them only.",
