    "description": "A unique, dystopian landscape where everything is red. The uncertainty, dread, and fear imparted by it stimulate the eeriness, catching the spirits of the emotions in the moment.\n\nThough I belong to Kerala, surrounded by its lush green flora and the misty clouds, the inability to experience them made me visualize a fictional landscape entirely renouncing what is around me.",
