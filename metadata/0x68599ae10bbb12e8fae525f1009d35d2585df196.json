    "description": "Project \"Intermolecular electricity\" by the collaboration of two artists, V. Kotov and D.Papizh.\nWe are exploring the transition of a flat, conditional visual image to a three-dimensional, animated, changing in space and time object.  Working on the project, we brought together our skills in analog video shooting and generative graphics.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nAll the universe is just a game of 5 elements. Everything consists from the same 5 elements. The same molecules. And only owing to millions of variations unique mixing, different and never repeated fusions in endless multiple combinations the world remains so fantastic and incredible \nAnd now in this digital age we can see the new chemistry of human being, the fusion of virtual particles and bio molecules. What is virtuously performing in art by generative design.\n\nOne artwork from the series, consisting of 4 parts.",
