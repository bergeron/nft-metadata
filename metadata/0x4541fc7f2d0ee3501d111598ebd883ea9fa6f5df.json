    "description": "The Game is a collection of 11 unique NFTs depicting DIY football balls. In 2018, photojournalist Dmitry Kostyukov spotted children playing football in Nakivale Refugee Camp in Uganda and several neighborhoods of its capital Kampala. Fascinated by these artifacts made with scrap materials, Dmitry photographed about twenty of them, willing to pay tribute to the ingenious young football players he befriended in Uganda. Further research revealed that this practice of upcycling is common in many parts of the world. These 11 hyper-realistic and detailed depictions of DIY balls each required months of artisanal 3D modeling with up to 50,000,000 polygons each with unique textures of plastic waste, rope fibers, dust particles, and custom raytracing to elevate surface translucency. Ball 001 consists of a mash-up of textured cloth parts with translucent plastic, rope fibers and inflated black rubber inlay.",
