    "description": "Chompadonka are Anxiety Demons. They rear their ugly heads in many ways, visiting us all at different moments in our lives. Some vanish as fast as they appear, but some stick around for a lifetime, shapeshifting, taking turns, and wreaking havoc any way they can. This particular Chompadonka is named Marcel, and it visits me while I’m awake, twisting my mind and my stomach into knots. The only way to rid myself of it was to tear it out of my mind and memorialize its ugliness on paper, giving true meaning to the saying “the pen is mightier than the sword”... All of this to say that I have no use for it anymore, as I have many others I’ve defeated, and many more that I’m wrestling, but if you want to tame your own Chompadonka, it always helps to have one that’s been defeated on your side for practice. If you’d like to own Marcel, I’m also happy to include the original hand-drawing. Just message me and let me know. Either way, godspeed in your own battles with Chompadonka.",
