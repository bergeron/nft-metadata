    "description": "Ksyusha \n\nYou can get some inspiration by looking through our photos, filled with the idea: SHINE BRIGTH NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nIn this collection you may notice how beautiful the special twins are. Dasha & Ksyusha are 9 y.o. twins with ICP paralysis, and they need special care for life.\n\nKristy helps her special twins with oil pastel drawings. Also, you may check the jewelry with the prints of the girlsâ€™ drawings.\n\nTake a look at young artists and Kristy, and feel shining bright no matter what!\n",
