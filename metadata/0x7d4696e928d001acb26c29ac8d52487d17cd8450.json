    "description": "While taking pictures in İzmir's Ödemiş district, I went to an authentic village coffee house to relax and drink tea, and as soon as I walked through the door, I felt like I had entered an old movie set from the 1950s. When I saw the man with the hat sitting at the table directly opposite the door and the authenticity of the environment, I had different feelings. It was a great environment with the smoke coming out of his cigarette, the music playing in the background and everything. Before I drank my tea, with my camera ready, I took a few photos without missing this moment.\n\nThis photo won the first prize in Artukbey's \"Coffee from Your Frame\" photography contest in 2018.\n \nArtis: Hasan UÇAR Edition: 1/1\nCamera: Nikon D610\nDate: 2018\nFile: jpeg 300 dpi\nLocation: İzmir / Türkiye\nImage Size: 4724 x 3374",
