    "description": "Wad of Wonders  “Seductive Silence”\n\nresting in freedom  \nseductiveness of silence  \nrumpus on wetlands\n\nWad of Wonders is an evolving collection of images created on the Wadden Islands in northern Europe. Through capturing the beauty of this area through my eyes as an artist I aim to create awareness for the protection and integrity of this last remaining large-scale, intertidal ecosystem where natural processes continue to function largely undisturbed.\n\nThe Wadden Sea, a Unesco World Heritage, is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud flats in the world, with natural processes undisturbed throughout most of the area. It encompasses a multitude of transitional zones between land, the sea and the freshwater environment, and is rich in plants and species specially adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. \n\nIt is considered one of the most important areas for migratory birds in the world and is connected to a network of other key sites for migratory birds. Its importance is not only in the context of the East Atlantic Flyway but also in the critical role it plays in the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory waterbirds. In the Wadden Sea up to 6.1 million birds can be present at the same time, and an average of 10-12 million pass through it each year.\n\nThe Netherlands - 2020 - 5120 x 2880 px  \nPhotographer Marieke Feenstra / marieke.nft  \nWad of Wonders\n\nI will donate 5% to charities for preservation of the Wadden Sea.\n\nLicense  \nThe holder is free to use the NFT for the Collector’s own personal, non-commercial use, self promotion, displayed privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays, as long as the creator is credited.
