    "description": "Does 20 minutes of your life mean anything? Or is it just a moment that fits into one picture?\n\nThis is the third artwork in my Aral series â€” it based on a photo of Red Desert Kyzylkum between Navoi and Bukhara cities.\n\nThat evening I was still on the train to Aral Sea. For hundreds of kilometers there are no people, Internet or any other communications, so this was the perfect chance to immerse in thoughts.\n\nWhile my camera took this photo for 20 minutes, I thought about time. 20 minutes is absolutely nothing. But on a global scale, even a whole human life can fit into one picture. Our planet has existed for billions of years, and time no longer plays such a big role.\n\nWhat should a person do to avoid wasting time? Dry the sea? Create a new one? Take a photo?\n\nThese thoughts are in the suprematic composition above.\n",
