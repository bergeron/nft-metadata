    "description": "Just imagine: we live in many parallel realities. There is no more offline and online. \n\nWe can choose what reality to be in at the moment. We are responsible for how all our realities look like, we fill them with the colors, vibes, people, things, events we want to have there. \n\nAnd how about easily switching between the realities as switching channels on the remote control? \n\nPhoto was taken by Masha Kozhdan during St. Petersburg fashion week in October 2022.  \n",
