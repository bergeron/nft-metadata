    "description": "SINCE3000 collaborated with Live Rocket Studios and 3D Artist Isaac Udogwu to turn Julianne Mooreâ€™s red carpet couture gowns into NFTs to be auctioned on Mogul Productions to benefit The Actors Fund. The highest bidder of each 1 of 1 SINCE3000 x Julianne Moore Genesis Collection NFT receives the NFT along with the corresponding couture gown. The SINCE3000 designs reimagine the beautiful beaded droplets of the emerald green Givenchy, the multi-dimensional luster of the Balenciaga fuchsia fabric, and the cobra-inspired embellishments of the Givenchy couture looks worn by Julianne Moore for the Year 3000. The oversized silhouettes are inspired by women who take up space with their ideas and ambitions. We aimed to introduce a point of view where the avatar walks with confidence as she embodies her past, present, and future self now.",
