    "description": "The Saints of the Drowned World rule over remains of bygone Apocalypses: Nuclear Winter, Cold War, Satanic Panic, Stranger Danger. They also rule over private childhood catastrophies: divorce, abuse, neglect and abandonment. The Saints are reminders that there have always been global catastrophies in the making as well as gentle guardians of our own very private and personal apocalypses. And a final reminder that catastrophic extinction events have always resulted in bursts of evolutionary change.",
