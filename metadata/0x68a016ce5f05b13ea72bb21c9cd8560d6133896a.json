    "description": "In a vast, empty field, lay a forgotten cyborg girl. She had been abandoned for years, left to the mercy of the changing seasons. No one came to her rescue, no one cared about her plight. She lay there, staring at the sky, waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and months turned into years. And still, she lay there, motionless, watching the clouds drift by. She had given up hope of ever being rescued, of ever being loved.\n\nBut then, one day, something changed. A strange figure appeared on the horizon, making its way towards her, giving her a glimpse of new hope. - SujiPop",
