    "description": "This is a historic spot on the silk route where traders from the central asian region travelled by double humped siberian camels and let them to rest in this region and later continued across the mountains on donkeys into Ladakh. \nAn interesting fact is, that even to this day, we find that the double humped Siberian camel live and breed  in the Nubra valley and have made it their home. \nThe silk routes were an important part of Ladakhi trade routes and were known to have been the trade route between China and India, this route is called as the Silk Route.\n\nIf there is one spot on Earth where you can photograph arid sand and dunes, flowing rivers, and snow-capped mountains all in the same frame, it has to be Nubra valley in Ladakh,  I am reminded of the sound of the continuous flow of water Shyok river gushing thru the rocks, and as we look up we see the snow capped mountains and us standing on the desert like sand dunes! \n\nDigital File 7000 x 3938 px\nResolution 300 DPI",
