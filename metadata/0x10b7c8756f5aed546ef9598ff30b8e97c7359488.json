    "description": "This portrait of Rob Moir, better known to the community as \"Chevy Pop\" was taken in Miami during Art Basel 2021. Rob was an early leader in the Web3 arena, the people's collector and known for his outrageous humor, realism and sense of style. I believe this portrait truly captures the essence of this man's spirit.\n\nShot on a Leica SL2-S. \n\nLeica Gang Gang",
