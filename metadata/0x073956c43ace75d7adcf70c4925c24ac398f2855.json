    "description": "ENGLISH: The person who obtains this piece will be connected with the universe and thus will be able to obtain blessings.\n\nSPANISH: La persona que obtenga esta pieza va a estar conectada con el universo y así podrá obtener bendiciones.\n\nIn March of 2022, we sent a collection of 60 NFTs to a group a Peruvian shaman in Cusco, Peru. The next day, after taking large doses of Ayahuasca, Maestro Lucio’s spirit and mind were expanded and he began to prophesy. One by one, he blessed and anointed each of these 60 NFTs while recording each session.  It is our hope that you choose your piece wisely as these are sacred and belong in good hands. \n\nAside from the shaman Maestro Lucio, the entire Ayahuasca Offerings team received help, assistance, and guidance through the use of intoxicating substances during every phase of the project. From caffeine to 2CD and even ayahuasca, everybody utilized their own form of mental inspiration for this project. ",
