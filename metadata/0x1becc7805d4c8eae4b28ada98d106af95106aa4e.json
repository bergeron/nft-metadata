    "description": "This NFT is the digitalised high definition copy of the physical artwork \"L’Envol\", created by Cedric Dubbiosi in Dubai, UAE (2022 ).\nMedium: Fluid painting & spray painting on Canvas (Dimension of the physical artwork: 61 x 51 cm)\n\n\"L'Envol\" is an abstract painting that represents the feeling of freedom and liberation. The composition is inspired by the notion of being free from social, political, cultural, and religious customs, without any limitations or restrictions. To be free is to possess the power to achieve anything, realizing our dreams and continuously pushing the limits of humanity one step further.\n\nThe painting is dominated by organic fluid elements that symbolize the wings of a bird that is taking off. These elements are bonded in harmony by a lozenge that represents femininity, women's emancipation, and the birth of new ideas. The vibrant colors in the painting evoke the sense of excitement and energy that comes with being liberated from the constraints of the world.",
