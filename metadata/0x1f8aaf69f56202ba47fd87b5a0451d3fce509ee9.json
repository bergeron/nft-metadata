    "name": "The Veil of Shame",
    "description": "Under any of my negative self beliefs is a veil of shame that blinds me from my inner power. When triggered, the lens I see the world through becomes tinted with lies about my sense of self. Unworthiness, inadequacy, and scarcity take hold and put my body into freeze.\n\nIt can be hard to see my inner narratives as I am experiencing them. So, any time I begin to question who I am at my core, itâ€™s a red flag for me that there is a deeper story present. Embracing the discomfort that comes with facing our stories with curiosity instead of more judgement is how we grow. We are not our stories. We are so much more.\n\nThe stories we tell ourselves about ourselves are the inner narratives that shape our life experiences. This collection combines my fashion and street photography to spark reflection about these narratives. Who could we be if we gave ourselves permission to rewrite and release the stories behind our self-worth, value, and sense of belonging? \n\nStreet photo: Film\nPortrait: Digital",
