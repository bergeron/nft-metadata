    "description": "Dream of flying\nFlying between buildings became a dream come true. The dream we had as a child and sometimes not only by plane, but only by thinking of bigger dreams we can feel it.\n\nThis is a photo from an imaginary collection that will be completed soon.\nThis photo has also been published on the 1x.com and 100ASA galleries.",
