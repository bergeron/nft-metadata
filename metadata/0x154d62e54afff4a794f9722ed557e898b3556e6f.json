    "description": "In Sook Kim's \"Drugstore\" series, she investigates the link between social structures, drugs, and mental diseases. Society's increasing use of performance-enhancing drugs is underscored, as is the rise of disorders like depression and burnout. Kim's work reflects societal problems, including the impact of unemployment and the destruction of individuality. She questions when behaviors become disorders and the arbitrary nature of legal drug use. Kim also challenges societal norms and perceptions about what's positive or pathological, underscoring that views can change, as seen with homosexuality.",
