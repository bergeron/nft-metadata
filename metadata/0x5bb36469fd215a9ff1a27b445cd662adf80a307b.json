    "description": "I had envisioned this photograph in early 2021. There were only 4 times during the year when it was possible to capture this alignment. I was able to plan a trip on 3 of those occurrences. I was not able to get the perfect alignment due to thick haze from the wildfires blocking the horizon during all of those trips. This photograph was made during one of those trips. While it may not be the perfect alignment I was going for, I still like it a lot. I hope to build on this collection in the coming years. ",
