    "description": "Adventure comes when leaving light and forcing yourself into the less kind side of the world. Its beauty may attract the brave and the lonely souls as well. \nEasy to get lost, but harder to come out with the treasure.\n\nThe mist filters light to paint the place as a small room, but big plains lay behind. \nMaybe enter as a blind one is the best choice.
