    "description": "Turtle Island is the name that various Indigenous nations have always called \"North America‚Äù since time immemorial. The name comes from oral histories and creation stories that tell of a turtle who holds the world on its back.\n\nThis piece contains elements of my own personal style along with traditional Cree & Woodland art forms. It celebrates the physical, spiritual, mental and emotional connections between animals, human beings and the land(s) from which they come.\n\nTurtle Island - Water 1/1, is one of the four elements. These four elements are believed to be the foundation of all life. Water represents emotion, intuition and inner reflection.\n\nA portion of proceeds contribute to an Indigenous Youth Arts Fund which directly fosters emerging Artists. Holders will have first access to future projects and art drops.",
