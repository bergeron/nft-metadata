    "description": "The By-the-wind Sailor spaceship is the pioneer of the Velella fleet. \nNo surprise it's the first one to be presented here. \n\nDirectly inspired by the \"velella velella\", it is recognizable by its emblematic sail that caps the structure. \nFlying through different worlds, this vessel aims to map the planets visited. \nIts sail and hull are able to adapt to the environment, allowing for a discreet, almost camouflaged approach. \n\nDrones are constantly flying around the craft, providing a more detailed analysis of the surroundings.\n\nAs the standard bearer of the Velella fleet, this peaceful vessel symbolises the spirit of the project. The exploration and study of the world around us.\n\n\nJPEG file - 6580x10000",
