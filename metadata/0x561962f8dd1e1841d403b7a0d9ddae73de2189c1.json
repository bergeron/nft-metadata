    "description": "Impact of single use plastic on wild life and environment:\n \nSaw this monkey trying to chew on the plastic container which was disposed off irresponsibly by someone in the forest. \n\nThis picture shows how the monkey is amazed by what it has found, and trying to bite off the toxic material. This is just an example to show that many animals might have done this and succumbed to this. \n\nThere are many such items which humans make use of and conveniently drop them off without knowing the after effects on animals and environment. \n\nLet's try and avoid the usage of single use plastics as a short term goal, and completely avoid plastic in any form as a long term goal.
