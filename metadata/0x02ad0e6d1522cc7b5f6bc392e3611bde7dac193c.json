    "description": "I often think, The distance between hands and feet is too far. What would happen if they were put together? So I combined them together. In order to make it more like a living body, I installed eyes on it. As a result, I got the current effect. I named it free body because it is like a bird flying freely with spread wings, but this is a NFT what must have various characteristics. So I thought that hands can be changeable,then I took hands as The only changing traits in the series of work produces this series of NFT. The background is a three-dimensional mesh and there is only one, which makes freebody look more three-dimensional.",
