    "name": "LADY KOIKOI 1",
    "description": "In Nigeria, she was depicted as a stylish teacher in a secondary school known for her beauty and her red heels. Whenever she walked in the hallways, her shoes would make the sound \"Koi Koi\", which is where the name \"Madam Koi Koi\" comes from. It was also said that she was very nasty to students and would beat them up for no reason. She was fired when she slapped a female student and injured her ear. On her journey back home, she was involved in an accident and died. Before she died she swore that she would have her revenge on the school and its students.\n\nNot too long after, students of the secondary school said at night they would hear a \"Koi Koi\" sound in the hallways of their dormitories after lights out, almost like the clicking of heels on a floor.",
