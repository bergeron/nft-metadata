    "description": "The Ghost’s “unknown fan” is a true embodiment of what it means to be hybrid in the world of One of None. In addition to this piece dropping with both a physical and digital component, The Ghost created “unknown fan” with a unique mixed media approach of neon and acrylic on canvas. In channeling the tight-knit community of Buffalo as a major source of inspiration, The Ghost completed this fully hybrid piece as a tribute to the Bills Mafia.",
