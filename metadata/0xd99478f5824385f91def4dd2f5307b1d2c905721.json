    "description": "Nouns themed wooden chess board crafted in high-quality wood,  inspired by minimalist lines.\n\nAll made of solid wood, the game consists of a box, where the pieces are stored inside, protected by cork. The lid becomes a board, and can be placed directly on the table or fitted on top of the box.\n\nEach piece is handmade, seeking the best finish in the smallest details.\n\nThe first owner of the NFT will receive the physical Nouns Chessboard #1.  \nFree shipping worldwide.\n\nThis was made possible thanks to [Nouns Prop House Round 5](https://prop.house/nouns/round-5/494)\n\nIt took more than 2 months to build, check the [process on this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/MafriendsArt/status/1544811091972313096)\n\n**Woods used:**  \nJatoba and Purple Heart.  \n**Dimensions:**  \nBox: 36 x 36 x 7 cm  \nChess pieces:  \nKing: 2.5 x 2.5 x 9 cm  \nQueen: 2.5 x 2.5 x 10 cm  \nBishop: 2.5 x 2.5 x 8 cm  \nKnight: 2.5 x 2.5 x 7 cm  \nRook: 2.5 x 2.5 x 7 cm  \n**Finishing:**  \nMineral oil and wax.\n\nArtist: Peltogyne  \n\nDesigned with ❤️ and a little help from [Mafriends](https://twitter.com/mafriendsart)",
