And the pain of loss creates a spiritual experience from which it is impossible to come out the same.\n\nThe ZEROING series, inspired by the experience of multiple starts from scratch, both in professional and personal life, reflects human feelings about the need to start all over again.\n\nResolution: 600\nDimensions: 8000 × 11698\nDigitally created\n",
