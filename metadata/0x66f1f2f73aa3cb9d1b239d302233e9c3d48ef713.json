    "description": "The joy and tears, the happiness and sadness. Happiness is a disguise for the true, hard, cold, loving world we live in today. Happiness might be the feeling you think you want, but it is not the only thing.\nSadness exist along with it. Both floats with the air and fades with the time.  Find yourself, fix what can be fix. Cry the tears with all the memories. Regret and resolve the wrong decisions. Because while both exist together, thereâ€™s always something meaningful within. \n\n\n- Director & Visual :\n   Bonzo\n- Music Composer & Arranger : \n   Rangga Purnama Aji\n- Music Director :\n   Rangga Purnama Aji\n- Electric Guitar Player:\n   Ketang Budairi Banjarnahor\n- Electric Bass Player : \n   Dewantara Hardyk Manurung\n- Audio Mixing & Mastering: \n   Ketang Budairi Banjarnahor\n\n\n\nDimensions \n1668x2388\nMP4",
