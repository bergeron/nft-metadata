    "description": "“INTERRUPTION/CORRUPTION'' is a vibrant animation of bears in their unnatural habitat, the garbage dump. In this work, Noodin Studio relates glitch art to the corruption of historic data throughout colonialism and the effects that has on his people’s spirit. The bears alternate between connection and disconnection as the video file goes through a process called datamoshing that results in glitches and visual corruption. The intergenerational effects of this sort of data loss can last many generations leading towards greater degradation of spirit and culture. In their connected form, the bears reveal their spirit represented in Woodland style art, and in their disconnected state, the bears become vacuums of shadowy darkness. The garbage dump alludes to our connection with the land and medicines that come from the land that have been corrupted by consumerism and capitalism. \nDate: August 6, 2022  \n",
