    "description": "Part of my conceptual self-portrait project \"Songs of Innocence and Experience\" on post-modern love.\nThis is my most personal work, a self-portrait collage project I started during the first lockdown. I started photography at age 17 with self-portraits and now at age 30 I found myself in front my camera again, recreating famous paintings of women. As I was going through a break-up at the time, this project became my art therapy. I was using fragments of texts I got from my ex-lovers/boyfriends or tinder dates, and also used scanned fragments of my favourite 19th century Romantic books (Wuthering Heights, Sorrows of Young Werther, Onegin or Red and Black), clashing my real life experiences with the notions of idealised love. This clash of expectations and reality becomes a postmodern \"authentic tragedy‚Äù.",
