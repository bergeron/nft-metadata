    "description": "Reiteration Circle\n\nReiteration, a series based on the theme of repetition, rotation and juxtaposition. The \"Reiteration Circle\" is the master image behind the whole series with a size of 9987 x 9987 px. Zig thousands of lines form this circle in a chaotic yet sorted and structured way. Zooming into the image, this fascinating structure becomes much more recognizable. White lines on black background, a homage to the simplicity of multiplicity. ",
