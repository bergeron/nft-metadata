In this hard time we stay together with our friends, families, team members and all people affected by conflict. We want to use NFT in the best way we can. To help those who need us.\n\nHow can you help? \n\nMint #NFTforUkraine on ethereum or polygon network with the amount of tokens you want to donate for war victims. Whole amount will be sent to special non-profit organisations. It's currently supervised by Bartek Sibiga and Jakub Chmielniak from Fancy Bears Metaverse",
