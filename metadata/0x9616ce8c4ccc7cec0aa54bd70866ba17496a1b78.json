    "description": "do you ever just laugh in traumatic situations because you don’t know what else to do? or just make a joke out of it ? because same. after my first drop, ‘sad girls always finish first,’ i realized that i was coming into terms with who i am as a manic and impulsive person who is always too nice & has severe trust issues. lol. but instead of making a sad song that would make me self reflect on my life (because i have plenty of those to go around) i decided to turn it into a dance vibe. and so, fantasies was born.\nthis song is about a world where my toxic love traits come into play because even though i pick up the wrong habits for relationships and all things love, there’s still a side of me that wants to be better, aka tell me ur fantasies and i got u. so have fun, dance, question life, or potentially heal something that this song reminds u of. i hope u love it & thank u for supporting me as always. :) ily",
