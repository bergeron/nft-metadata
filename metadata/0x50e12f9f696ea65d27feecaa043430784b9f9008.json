    "description": "This to me signifies that through death there is light.  Something to pin our hopes to.  Something to hold close to our heart. That out of the darkness we will live life again.\n\nTorres del Paine National Park had been on my bucket list for a long time, so when I was invited to go on this trip I didnâ€™t have to think twice before agreeing.  \nPart of the park is known for its dead trees and they were everywhere.  People wander around for hours looking for the perfect one, with most never finding it.  This was me too the previous day and I had almost given up.  That's the thing about planning an image.  Nothing short of what you have imagined will do.  \n\nWe got up early to shoot sunrise at the waterfall which was average and blowing a gale.  I eventually wandered away looking for some shelter when I came across this tree.  Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the sky to light up so long after sunrise, framing this tree exactly how I had hoped.    It was magical!\n\nFunny story, well it is now. Just after this was taken a huge gust of wind caught my backpack, picked me up and threw me quite some distance across the park.  Bruised but not broken, thankfully.  The glamorous life of a landscape photographer!\n\nImage minted for NFT Aotearoa",
