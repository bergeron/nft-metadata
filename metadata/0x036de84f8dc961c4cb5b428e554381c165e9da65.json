    "description": "my 1st collab with reo and the 1st song ever minted on top of a blocktone. i couldnt have imagined something like this in my time but here we are. \n\nGino, Stolar and Reo hit me up right around art basel with the idea to have a writing camp in miami where we could write fire songs to blocktones beats. i wanted to make sure that whatever we did, the music was right and we were pushing web3 forward. \n\nwe had so much fun on this one. first, the beat was epic, and getting to make something right off a blocktone that reo owned - that we could do whatever we wanted with - was one of those moments where i really felt the magic of web3. \n\nthe studio in miami was iconic also so the whole thing was inspiring as fxck. reo bodied the track of course. this is def one of my favorite collabs ive ever done. its a blessing to get to work with amazing people and live this life everyday. \n",
