    "description": "Good and Evil, or Light and Shadow, I have always compared these two opposites. Because without light, there is no shadow, just as there will be no evil without good. While the main character in Evil is human, for Light the main character is the obstacles in front of the sun. From my point of view, \"The Path of Shadow\" perfectly reflects this tremendous Light-Shadow balance in Nature.",
