    "description": "Yoga Bangkok 2020\n\nThe Archygif series arose out of my desire to bridge the gap between the often contradictory visual worlds in which I inhabit , that of formal static Architectural photography and more candid fast moving ‘gonzo’ environments .\n\nThe Archygif was first created in India in 2018 and inspired by the Indian concept of Jugaad , mechanical and technological non-conventional, frugal innovation, often termed a \"hack\". \n\nAn Archygif is a simple stop motion scene that captures both the formal and informal nature of architectural environments \n\nThe series is on going \n\n",
