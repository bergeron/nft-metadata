    "description": "Around a corner on a steep incline this valley appeared and caused my heart to race. I had seen it before, but never green and never wet.  I love it when I find jewels in the desert wilderness. I spent the sunset hours walking all across this valley. I plan to revisit over the seasons and get to know it's changes and moods. \n\nUpon request, the NFT holder will receive high quality JPG suitable for printing. \n\nLicense: As long as the creator is credited, the primary NFT holder can use the NFT in advertising, to display privately and in groups, and to create virtual galleries, documentaries, and essays.
