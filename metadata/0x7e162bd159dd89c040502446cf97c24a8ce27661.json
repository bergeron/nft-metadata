    "description": "In the bible the camel is seen to represent both humility and servitude but also stubbornness and being unwilling to change. The camel standing by the abandoned gas station is a metaphor for a state of limbo or transition, reflecting the camel's dual symbolic nature of servitude and stubbornness. \n\nThe abandoned gas station represents a point of departure or a metaphor for a lost opportunity, while the camel standing still beside shows that it is not ready to move past the last station and into the unknown.
