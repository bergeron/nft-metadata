    "description": "In the immediate post-World War II period, the vicinity of Shinjuku Station was the site of a sizable black market. In those days, visiting the area was undoubtedly perilous, but few people had a choice. Here were the supplies and here was the meal.\n\nThe current Shinjuku Station was built in the late 1960s, partially razing the old black market, which had already been licensed as a restaurant district. A major fire in 1999 further damaged the area. But a large portion has so far, against all chances, survived.\n\nEven though they are now all legally recognized eateries, the heritage of the current Omoide Yokocho food stalls nevertheless dates back to the wild spirit of the previous black market era.",
