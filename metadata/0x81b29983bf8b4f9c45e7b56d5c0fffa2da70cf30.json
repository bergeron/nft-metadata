    "description": "When I cleaned up, I lost two things that were my best of friends. Alcohol and Drugs. I really struggled trying to find my way when I cleaned up. This piece looks at the relationship I had with addiction and substances and how those things seemed to be my only friends. Today painting pieces like this is a reminder of how far I've come and how much further I want to go. Today I have real friends and connections who care about me. That is real. That is human. That is me.\n\nIncludes an exclusive 1/1 22x28 artist signed print.",
