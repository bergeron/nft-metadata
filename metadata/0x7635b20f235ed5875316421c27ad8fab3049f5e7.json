    "description": "The main inspiration for this series comes from the Philippine myth of the sea goddess Bakunawa. There are several version of the story that appear throughout the islands of the archipelago.   The version I found most interesting comes from the Visayan region.   It tells the story of a beautiful sea goddess who looked up and saw the seven moon bothers. Her infatuation led her to rise from the water and devour six of the seven brothers.   Bathala, the god creator of all things, punishes her by turning her into a sea dragon, banished to the depths of the ocean as the guardian of the passage between worlds.",
