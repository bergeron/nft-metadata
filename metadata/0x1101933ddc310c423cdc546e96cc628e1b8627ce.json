    "description": "“Cinders remain from what is not and never was in the world,” Derrida writes in his book “Cinders”. It allows us to think of ashes as a remnant and trace of what is not in the world, both as “being-entity” and “non-being”. \n\nThe ashes collected by burning unrelated materials every day were brought together then scanned and transferred to the computer. \n\nWhile this association presents a residue of non-existent substances, the structure that integrates with other substances turns into a heterogeneous residue. Although the act of burning eliminated access to the existence of the entity, as a result of this consumption, the entity left ashes, allowing the relationship between the existence of the entity to continue.  While examining the concepts such as increase-decrease of the threshold between change and transformation, size, form, and diversification, the aim is to contact the vital process.\n\nDimensions: 2250x2250, Resolution:300, Color Profile: sRGB IEC61966-2.1",
