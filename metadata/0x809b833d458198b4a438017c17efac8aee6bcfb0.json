    "description": "I created this painting when I was in quarantine, when I had no money and tried my best to earn some on my art to make a living, and the idea came to my mind why not to create a painting which symbolizes my state for that time, the state of being intertwined with your favorite work like a Venom, finding balance and struggling with all the difficulties in the way, so it was the creation of my picture VENOM #3",
