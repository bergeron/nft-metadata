    "description": "In the “Play” series, I've been exploring various different techniques in painting and having fun enjoying the process of creation. Returning back to color after spending nearly two years with the “Rebel,” an experimental series where I went against my creative instinct, and put aside my former colorist style. With Play, I am reaching back into my inner child, creating a body of work that personifyś no self judgment, doubt, and embodies joy, exploration and adventure.  ",
