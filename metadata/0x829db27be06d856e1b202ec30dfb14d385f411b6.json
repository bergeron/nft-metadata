    "description": "This video is a short excerpt from my short film about vulnerability. I was inspired by the books of Bren√© Brown.  I chose images of water and masks to represent shame. Water is like a certain substance where we fall when we experience this feeling. I also love how Andrey Tarkovskiy uses water in his films. And with the help of a mask, we rather want to close ourselves from people who have fixed our sense of shame. I would like people to learn to live with their vulnerability and shame, stop fighting with them. It makes life very easy and makes us free.",
