    "description": "Up in the mountain village of Topolia in Crete, Greece there is a unique wood art shop with an even more unique owner. An inspiring artist, who when not in his shop travels around the world, Manolis will make you feel like you are stepping into his home every time you visit his shop. He will offer you a local drink, encourage you to touch any products you like and let you into his crazy world adventures, and what it might be hours later, you will step out of his shop with some beautifully crafted wood pieces and an everlasting memory of Manolis.",
