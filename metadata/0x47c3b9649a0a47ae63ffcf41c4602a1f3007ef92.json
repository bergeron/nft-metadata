    "description": "The concept and meaning of this work was quite simple and straightforward “Every kids should be able to imagine their own dreams by themselves” by building their own little worlds that were all intertwined, freely, without any rules.\n.\nUnfortunately, this piece of art may not reach to many kids and even fewer would understand its context.\n.\nTherefore, this is my messages to you, the person who was once a kid. Please don’t forget what you have dreamt about. Have you ever draw your dreams out? Have you ever try to achieve your dream yet? Back then you may not be able to fulfill your dream for what ever reasons but don’t let your dreams fade away. It’s never hurt to try and nothing’s ever too late.\n.\nWhen the day comes, please send this freedom to dream for the next generation. Do not crash the dreams of others. Let them dream, try, and do what they want. Even if their dreams seem impossible to you, let them build their own world fearless and freely",
