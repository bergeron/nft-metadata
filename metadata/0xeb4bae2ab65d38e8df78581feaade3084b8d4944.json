    "description": "Remember is a photo collection that depicts a world before civilization encroached on it. Embracing memories, as we go back in time with each image, reminiscing about our culture, its rainbow-colored traditions, and the lovely ways of living and embracing all life forces... Our skin, our clothes, the way we wear our culture, dancing with our tribes, and singing in our dialects all contribute to the beauty of African culture. I hope that this project transports us back in time to our ancestors' pre-colonial memories with each image.\n\n",
