    "description": "0R1ZONTE I, 2023.\nGenerative,  1920 x 1920, 0:09 mins, loop.\n\n0R1ZONTE is a mesmerizing triptych of generative art that depicts an abstract skyline in three different lighting conditions. Created by artist Fabio Catapano in 2023, each piece in the series – 0R1ZONTE I, II, and III – showcases little pixels moving vertically on the screen, creating an infinite loop that draws the viewer in. The hypnotic effect is amplified when all three pieces are displayed together in perfect sync, showcasing the intricate interconnection between them. The use of generative art techniques adds an additional layer of complexity to the work, making each viewing a unique and immersive experience.",
