    "description": "Duvatts work as entertainers at Smuj’s Circus. They can pull doves from hats, rabbits from shoes and terrapins from balaclavas. ‘How do they do that?’ I hear you proclaim. Simple, Duvatts are magic so they don’t have to think about how to do tricks because they don't need to. They don’t need a box with hidden compartments to saw a lady in half, they just saw a lady in half and everything is fine. That’s magic!",
