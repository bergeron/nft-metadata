    "description": "I should’ve listened to my spirit but I knowingly said no. Even if I knew how it would end I’d still proceed because I liked the love and attention she gave me. My ego wanted to be stroked. My ego got me hurt. My ego got me burnt. \n\nIf I knew in advance I would have proceeded with more caution. \nI really put all my heart into one basket. \nI see why guys have options now but the [player] trait is just not in my character. \n\nAdditional Info:\nAs the collector of this NFT you have the option to recieve the signed physical piece. 16x20 inches Mixed media collage on Hahnemühle Premium Fine Art Giclee Paper mounted on gatorboard braced for hanging.",
