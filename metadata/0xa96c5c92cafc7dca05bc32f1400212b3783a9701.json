    "description": "Dusha is the title of my first photographic project and my first monograph. At the beginning of my career, I moved to Russia for the first time 20 years ago. At that time, I did not know the language yet, but I was an avid reader of Russian literature, and this project is partly inspired by one of my favourite books: \"Oblomov\" by Ivan Goncharov.\n\nThe images part of the collection are numbered as in the original printed edition and they are digitalized from Analog Photographic Prints.\n\nAbout the project:\n\n[Dusha 2005-2009](https://davidemonteleone.com/projects#/dusha/)",
