    "description": "Written & Performed by: MoRuf\nProduced by: Matt Cody ( @ProducerMC)\n\nThis track was inspired off of a conversation me and my engineer Matt Cody was having in the studio one day. It started off with us speaking on having multiple streams of income, then some how lol the convo maneuvered its way into us both looking back and realizing how far we've come.\n\n \"Damn the shyt is so true/ these the days that i prayed for swear everything is so new\" . It represents me taking a moment to be present and actually reflect on where i am in life as well as how excited i am for what's to come.  A mix of the past, present and future. I'm a big believer in manifesting things that you would want in life and this song 5ways represents speaking all of your wishes and goals into existence. Enjoy and share with the homies. Much love and it feels good to be back.\n\nBig Blesss!\n\n- MoRuf",
