    "description": "Street Photography, 2022 - Sendagaya, Tokyo\nPhotographed by Goro - *one loud image*\n\nThis is the seventh selected image of the DEFAULT TOKYO series that features in the NFT project.\n\nThe Hatonomori Hachiman Jinja was founded in the early/mid 8th century. The Shinto Shrine is famous for its 6-meter high Fuji-san imitation, which is said to give the same blessing as climbing the actual mountain. In the background, between the trees, the iconic Docomo Tower (NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building) looms against the horizon.\nOld and new, modern and traditional, shrill and conservative.. in this very city, everything mixes higgledy-piggledy, it seems.\n\nThe photo was taken from the southeast corner of the shrine area, northwest direction.\n\nEdition 1/1\n\nSONY α6600\nISO 100\n63 mm\n*f* / 10.0\n1/200 sec\n\n6000 × 4000 px\nJPG 12.2 MB",
