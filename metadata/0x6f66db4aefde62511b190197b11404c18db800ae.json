    "description": "The bond of those living on the street with stray animals has always impressed me. Mr. Muzaffer shared most of his food with the street cats. Unfortunately he is not alive now. We lost him, but this photo won the grand prize in two major competitions and told the world about true love and friendship.\n\nThis photo won the \"best photo\" award by kodak in 2004. That year, my work was printed on kodak film boxes. He won the grand prize again in the competition themed \"Yunus Emre Love\".\n\n. Taken with an analog camera (Nikon 801s)\n. Kodak negative film\n. Dimensions: 4000× 3295\n. Resolution: 300 dpi\n. Edition: 1/1\n. Year : 2002\n. Location: İstanbul / Türkiye\n\nArtist : Berker Dalmış\n",
