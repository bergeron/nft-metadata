    "description": "This is the story of the curse and the kiss, the demon and the girl. It's a love story with dancing and death in it, and singing and souls and shadows reeled out on kite strings. A cursed Kiss gave birth to a throb and caution falls away. The girl might feel suddenly wild like a little monsoon. She might forget her curse just long enough to get careless and let it come true.\n\n\nDetails \n\nIllustrator : kooshnashah\nComposer : Sepidar",
