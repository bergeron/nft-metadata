    "description": "death, you never get used to it, the idea of someone being gone. we all know our time in this world is limited, and that eventually all of us will end up at the same place. But what if death is no more than passing from one room to another. A room where you could be free from the worldly life and inhibitions. The question remains , are we really gone once we’ve embraced the warm emanating death? the memories that we leave behind are really just the memories or are they voices of our loved ones looking for a connection. I don’t know if any of it is true.",
