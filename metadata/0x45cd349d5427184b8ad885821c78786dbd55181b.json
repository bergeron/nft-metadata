    "description": "Ringstind is a mountain in the mountain chain named Hurrungane in Norway. Its a summit 2 124 meters above sea level.  A 6-8 hours backcountry ski session. \nI have been there once, and its one of the finest mountains I've been on to this date! You'll be meet by a fantastic view of Hurrungane, and you have a great view of the most famous mountain in the area, Store Skagastølstind. \n \nI love to go backcountry skiing during winter, and I aim to go this again this year(2022). Its almost 10 years ago last time I was there!\nThe photo was taken summer 2019, when me and my girlfriend(now wife) went roadtripping in the midst of Norway. I can recommend to anyone visiting Norway, to travel to Hurrungane in Sogn and Fjordane and see the mountains there. \n\nI took this photo summer 2019, with my Panasonic GH4, with my Leica 50mm, F 1.4\n\nLocation:\n61°26′31″N 7°48′02″E",
