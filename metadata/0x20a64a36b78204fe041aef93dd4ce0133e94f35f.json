    "description": "This piece captures the transformation undertaken by Anas. He used to be a lawyer but now he builds communities. The piece includes aspects from his life - a shot of the Dubai skyline (where he lives) and from his travels in Vietnam. Music is a big part of his soul, which is represented by the guitar in his heart!\n\nThe is part of the Connected With Your Soul collection which I produce with the people I meet! Anas and I created this piece together painting it with the colours from our lives! Life can be black or white, but it depends on you to put colour in it. ",
