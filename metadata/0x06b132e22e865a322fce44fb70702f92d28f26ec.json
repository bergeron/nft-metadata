    "description": "Have you ever noticed only palaces and temples are painted with beautiful colours? We called this dancheong. Dancheong is the Korean traditional decorative colouring.  \nYou can introduce to your foreign friends the meaning of dancheong through the 7 days of the week.  \nSunday means sun. Monday means moon. Except for these two days, we can find the 5 colours from the weekdays.  \nTue-red(fire), Wed-black(water), Thu-blue or green(tree). Fri-white(metal). Sat-yellow(earth).  \nThese five basic colours are related to the Five Elements that make up the universe.\n\nFile: 3984 x 3984px - Release Date: Dec 27, 2022",
