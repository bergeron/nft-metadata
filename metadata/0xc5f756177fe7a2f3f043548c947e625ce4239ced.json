    "description": "The beach is a playground where people can be themselves: they sun-bathe, gossip, swim, picnic and purchase all manner of goods. Countries display their national characteristics on the beach, adding to the delight of this theatre. \n\nRamos is a new and artificial beach, an enormous ’swimming pool’ (hence its popular name, ’Piscinão de Ramos’) surrounded by sand and filled with seawater. It is located near a polluted beach, 24 km north of the decidedly upmarket – and of course much better known – Copacabana. The series was shot during 4 years, initially commuting in and out, but latterly staying in a small cottage just near the beach. \n\nLike most of my work, this project comes from a desire to explore issues of identity and the relationships between people and their \nenvironment. \n\nThis series has been widely published and exhibited around the world and became a book in 2015. \n\nRamos #2 is part of a collection of 15 works and one of my favorite images.
