    "name": "Lights over Marfa",
    "description": "I started taking photographs of West Texas starting 2002 when I bought my first motorcycle. This particular year I set out to film the Marfa Lights. Its a phenomenon that has been puzzling people for hundreds of years. Mysterious lights that move around in the sky. Ancient folklore even has stories about them. To this day no one knows what they are. My first year there I didn't catch them. As a joke to my friends I showed them this photo I light painted in the middle of the desert. This was incidentally the first time I realized how much I enjoyed light painting. So while this isn't THE Marfa Lights. It is my light over Marfa.",
