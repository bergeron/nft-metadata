    "description": "My ancestors lived in Ostrołęka, Poland in the 19th century. Pogroms were an issue. Rabbi Yitzchak Białystok was the first to succeed in the creation of the Mechanical Golem, a fully autonomous robot made of iron and steel designed to defend the shtetl’s inhabitants. Rabbis from near and far came to study under Rabbi Białystok. Soon, the Hassidic communities were guarded by whole battalions of these robotic defenders. Antisemitic mobs, once fearless and brutal, quickly learned to avoid these fortified villages, as their attacks were met with unyielding resistance from the Golem. Tales of the Mecha-Shtetls and their divine protectors became the stuff of legend. ",
