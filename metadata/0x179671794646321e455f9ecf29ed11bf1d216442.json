In this case I image a little bit of both.\n\nThis shot was taken on Dec 4th 2020 at Noriega Street in Ocean Beach, San Francisco.\n\nThe beach was a party at first light as locals watched their peers paddle into San Francisco's Monsters.\n\nTaken on Fuji XPro1 with a vintage 300mm Yashica lens and adapter.",
