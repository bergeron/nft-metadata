    "description": "In October 4th 2021 Alexandre passed away. He had a very serious and rare disease called Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). He was less than three years old. Alexandre was a very adventurous and loving cat and I rescued him mid-2019 from a shelter. This 35mm photograph was taken late 2019. With this edition I want to spread the love that he has given me.
