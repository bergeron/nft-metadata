    "description": "1/1 Original\nGenesis NFT\nHigh Resolution PNG\n4800 x 6000 px @ 300 dpi\n\nðŸ”»\n\nFollowing the untimely death of a good friend at the closing of 2021, I began to search deep within myself for answers concerning the phenomenon of death.\n\nI became fascinated by the creation of death masks throughout history; facial molds made from wax or plaster from the recently deceased â€“ the final likeness and essence of the physical body. A symbol of honor and respect to the dead, and a reminder to the living of a life lost. \n\nAncient Egyptians were among the first to create intricate, golden death masks through their belief that the body's need for a mask was mandatory, so that the soul could recognize it, and accompany it during the journey through the underworld.\n\nThis collection of work is my exploration of death masks, both conceptually and visually. Each mask is created through a combination of traditional and digital mixed media with running elements, symbolism, and metaphysical ideas.",
