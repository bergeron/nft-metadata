    "description": "This collection is something special. These types of images are my trademark. On the NFT (Image 1) I dreamed of traveling in philosophy. I wondered what is outside of what is visible to us? What is hidden in other dimensions? Are we bound to time in other dimensions? I have tried to reflect on canvas these questions and the journey I have taken. As seen in the image, our human DNA expands and leads into the unknown. Where universes are enclosed, bubbles are reflected in the unknown. These are connected to each other. The clock on the lower right is held by a strand of DNA and symbolizes the question, are we humans bound to time in other dimensions? The time on it shows when I painted the clock. Black holes can also be seen, which lead back to a level unknown to us. Neutrons and photons circle and shoot energy into black quenchers on their way into the unknown.\nLet the NFTs sink in and follow your own associations.\nKind regards, your Sebastian Becker Weimar (NFT-Beckus86-NFT).",
