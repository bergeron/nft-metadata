    "description": "i wrote “In My Head” after beating myself up for having the most outlandish thoughts.  humans think over 17,000 thoughts a day, on average, and often times we let those narratives drive us to some pretty insane beliefs.\n\nyour own mind can be your biggest enemy; flooded with wild ideas around the what ifs and how’s and when’s, or even \"what would happen if i just stopped my car in the middle of the freeway right now?\"\n\nour mind can be more dangerous than the outside world; dictating your belief system about yourself & the world & persuading you to believe scenarios that are far from reality. “In My Head” was a response to the recognition of how important it is to not identify with each and every thought that infiltrates your brain, & to remind yourself of who you know u are at ur core <3 i hope you like it :’)",
