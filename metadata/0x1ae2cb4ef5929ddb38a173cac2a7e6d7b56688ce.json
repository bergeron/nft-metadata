    "description": "The moon upon the wide sea  \nPlacidly looks down,  \nSmiling with her mild face,  \nThough the ocean frown.  \nClouds may dim her brightness,  \nBut soon they pass away,  \nAnd she shines out, unaltered,  \nO'er the little waves at play.  \nSo 'mid the storm or sunshine,  \nWherever she may go,  \nLed on by her hidden power  \nThe wild see must plow.\n\nAs the tranquil evening moon  \nLooks on that restless sea,  \nSo a mother's gentle face,  \nLittle child, is watching thee.  \nThen banish every tempest,  \nChase all your clouds away,  \nThat smoothly and brightly  \nYour quiet heart may play  \nLet cheerful looks and actions  \nLike shining ripples flow,  \nFollowing the mother's voice,  \nSinging as they go.\n\n- Poem by Louisa May Alcott",
