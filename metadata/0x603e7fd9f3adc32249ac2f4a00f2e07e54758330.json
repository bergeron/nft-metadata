    "description": "I've spent countless hours staring up at the vast expanse that is our universe. The more I stare, the more I learn about my self and wat it means to be human. It gives me two contradicting thoughts, both of which I find calming. \n1- We are insignificant. We mean nothing! When we die the universe doesn't change, it just keeps going, if humanity were wiped out the planet would be better off. \n2- We are significant.  We mean everything! To those around us, to our family and friends we can mean everything. A loss can break us, finding someone new can complete us. Two contradicting thoughts that make me forget about the stresses of everyday life. The reason I keep going out chasing stars in the middle of nowhere.",
