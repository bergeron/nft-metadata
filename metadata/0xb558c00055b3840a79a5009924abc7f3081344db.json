    "description": "The COMPANyons are a series of pets for the characters of MIXED COMPANY to ‘adopt’ that were created using the same creative process and styling as MIXED COMPANY. Holders of the former collection will have first dibs on the mint. All pet names appear as a number, and miners will have a limited window to name their pets. *Names will be assigned only once.\n\nMixed Company series of mixed media portraits began in 2016, and various collections within this series have been exhibited throughout Japan since that time. The art is tactile in nature, consisting of hand-drawn elements, found paper collage elements, and for the first time, digital elements.",
