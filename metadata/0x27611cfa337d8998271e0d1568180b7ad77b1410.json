    "description": "If you’re reading this it means they found the capsule in the backyard. My album is my life - it’s everything I’ve experienced and seen around me - my relationship with everyone and everything in my world, even myself. I’ve seen blessings and I’ve seen tragedies, seen friends win Grammies and others become zombies, seen some have kids and some pass away.\n\nThat being said, I’ve always believed the song should be defined by the listener, so I don’t want to say too much on what it means to me, but I will say unequivocally and absolutely: fuck fentanyl.\n",
