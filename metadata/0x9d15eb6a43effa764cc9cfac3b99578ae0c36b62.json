    "name": "The house of values",
    "description": "I truly believe we initially know from our birth who we are and what is valued for us. Growing up, we are losing its understanding and self-confidence, and as a result we doubt ourselves. We take unimportant things and copy social dictated expectations. Thus, we become absolutely identical and ignore our individuality and personality. \nMy collection is devoted to the true house of values. It's devoted not to our living with its real set of values but how we take somebody's dictated wrong set, unconsciously passing it off as our own.",
