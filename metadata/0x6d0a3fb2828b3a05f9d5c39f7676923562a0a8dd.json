    "description": "NFT+ original painting\n\nFebruary 24, my world has turned over.  It was so \nhard to finish this artwork, everyday I fight myself to make art in the same time when Ukraine fight to be independent.  Ukraine fight for democracy.  Ukraine fight against biggest country on the planet, against old and ugly totalitarianism.\n\nMillions of people were forced to leave their homes. Thousands of home were destroyed forever.  Hundreds of people underwent violence in my homeland.  I haven't seen my family and my friends almost 5 month and i wanna scream about it. \n\nIn my art you can see ugly monsters - i don't like to draw war machines. \n\nThis Year - is year of big changes. Year of big losses. Year of truth. Open your eyes. \n\nHumanity should change. Change priorities. Appreciate life. Appreciate nature. Respect each other, respect different cultures. \n\nBut firstly: HANDS OFF UKRAINE!",
