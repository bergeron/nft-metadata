    "description": "This NFT is one of 100 photos of the data-sculpture 'Cyanopsitta 001' that belongs to the series 'Data-Phantoms: Impossible Nesting' (2022) by the multimedia artist Clarissa Ribeiro (Brazil)  generated using as raw-data the birdsong of the Ararinha azul (Cyanopsitta spixii) a species that  was officially declared extinct in nature. In a moment we sadly see young birds forgetting their songs as adults are dying faster, the work invites us to meditate on how fragmented audio memories of birds recorded by humans in short videos shared online on platforms such as Vimeo and YouTube, haunt our imagination as phantoms of long-gone forests increasingly replaced by anthropogenic landscapes.
