    "description": "There's an expansive realm anchored to the patterns we unconsciously or consciously carry and engage. If recognized, we can choose to hold these embedded patterns in all we do with deep peace and acceptance, granting us a 'fuller' experience of being. \n\nThe display of this gentle wanderer reminds us that how we do anything is how we do everything, and that any action or non-action is a reflection of the flowing operation of our deepest patterns of soul.\n\n\nVisuals by Kenza\nMusic by Arnie Rodriguez",
