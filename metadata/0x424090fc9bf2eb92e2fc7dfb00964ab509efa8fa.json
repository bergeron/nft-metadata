    "description": "   A single sound...a vibration...an impact that started all creation for eons to come. Hear the drums of Life. A deep pounding of exuberant bliss!...Rhythms echoing throughout the ages....then total silence and calm, then a sound begins again. If ever your internal the noise becomes all too loud, listen softly... quietly...listen for her lyric,...listen for, Queen Lyrica. \n\nImage render size 2891 x 4096.",
