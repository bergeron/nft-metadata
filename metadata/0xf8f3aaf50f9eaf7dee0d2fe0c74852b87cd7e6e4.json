    "description": "Once upon a time, there was a magical Tiny village tucked away in the countryside. The people who lived there were special because they loved living simply and taking care of the earth.\n\nThe villagers were always so happy because they got to live in a peaceful place where they could play and work together. They were like a big family! They shared their food, played games, and sang songs around the campfire at night.\n\nThe village was filled with the cutest little houses made of clay, in all sorts of colors. Each one was unique, just like the villagers who lived inside. But they were all made with love.\n\nThey'll lead you to the magical tiny village where you can live like a true earth protector and make lots of new friends!\n\n",
