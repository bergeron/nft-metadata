    "description": "It's such a terrifying and stressful time. \nAs an artist with Ukrainian roots my heart is bleeding for all the innocent people who got involved in these political games.\n\nI believe that the war is never the answer, because the anger breeds only the misery and destruction.\n\nBut I think if each of us could find a strength to create something kind and beautiful, we will live in a new world full of peace and love.\n\nStay safe.\n\n",
