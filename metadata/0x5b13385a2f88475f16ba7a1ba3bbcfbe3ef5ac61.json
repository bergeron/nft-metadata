    "description": "There's always a point in time, even when every other thing fails, where we need to discover ourselves.\n\nAs imperfect beings, life makes it complicated for us to truly discover our potentials, but rather paves way for us to be in constant illusions.\n\nIt requires a bold step for us to come out of our masks and illusions to see the reality of our true potentials and that's when we can truly discover ourselves.\n\n\n©️ JOHNPAUL VAL\n\nBest regards",
