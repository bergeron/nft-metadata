    "description": "The main ritual in the Holi festival is happening in the temple of Vrindavan and as photographers we need to find the vantage point to get some good shots. That in mind, we reached the temple early in the morning at around 7 am. The wait for the ritual was too long and we found a good spot and sat there until 4 pm until the ritual started. Meanwhile a lot of people are coming in,playing with colors,dancing and all. I noticed this person dancing in between a bunch of people and realized if he looks up to me then there is a good chance of a great photo. After some long wait with the camera targeting him, in a fine moment he looked up to me and I got what I wanted.",
