    "description": "This artwork was drawn on the canvas with oil painting. Imade an accent on expending blue with purple color. I drew this artwork based on my memory of a landscape.\nI want to express the \"color of memory\" that I saw or felt somewhere someday. My main method of expression is mixed media such as oil on canvas and acrylic on paper. The color of the water, the color of the mountains, the color of the sky, the color of the city, the color of the vegetation, they are all in the memory of life, and they all lead to painting. myself. I consider myself a flat painter. In the process of layering \"color and space\", which are important elements of the work, it leads to the \"color of memory\", which is a Japanese sensibility.\n\nkurosiba66.wixsite.com/mysite\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mariko_teratoko/?hl=ja\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MarikoTeratoko",
