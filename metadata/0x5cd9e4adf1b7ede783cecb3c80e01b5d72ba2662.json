    "description": "Once upon a time, there was an poop emoji named Bowels. Bowels felt plain and unremarkable until he stumbled upon a group of artists creating NFTs. They loved his unique style and made him the star of their latest project. People from all over the world began collecting Bowels' NFTs, and he became a symbol of creativity and originality. Bowels finally found a place where he belonged, in the sewers of degens toilets.\n\nWith love\n\n- Cozy & Rohit (Inspired by @DEVONFIGURES)",
