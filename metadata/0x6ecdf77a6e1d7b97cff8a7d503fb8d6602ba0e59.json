    "description": "I was flying over a dense forest of conifers and noticed a section of downed trees. As I approached it, the shape that formed began to resemble a heart. The mental association with this was greatly aided by the vibrant red in the trunks of the trees, which contrasted with the dark green of the surroundings standing trees. \n\nI feel this piece is the perfect launch to the Communitree series as it incorporates many of the symbols that this collective series(paired with Singularitrees) embodies.",
