    "description": "I want people to feel how beautiful, powerful and essential the ocean is in their heart. Because feeling is the beginning of truly seeing. \nTo illuminate this beauty I drew a parallel between humans and animals in nature. Animals in nature are naked, humans are born naked. This is the raw beauty of being alive and it seems that all living beings share one thing in common â€“ they want to connect. \nTo create this work I was very lucky to find a whale in the wild waters of Tonga island. A rare sight of a spermwhale, even a more rare sight - a connection of a sperm whale with the human. I felt so grateful and fortunate to be able to spectate that one in a lifetime moment and to make this special underwater shot. In the end, we all came from the same place.",
