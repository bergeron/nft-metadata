    "description": "deep in the sea of the mind there lies a subconscious part of you. this part of the mind defines all reactions and automatic actions we can become aware of if we think about them. these are where our values, emotions, beliefs, vices, and imagination take shape. deep inside there is a meaning to every reaction you have. As you go through life we may not become aware of what we are and why we are.  This photo perfectly describes a change in one's normal mental state different from regular consciousness.",
