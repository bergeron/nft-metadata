    "description": "02 â€“ \"my girl\"\n\nLove has, and always will be the most complex and confusing emotion in all of its joy and agony. We fall in love... we believe that it will conquer all... that nothing can come between us and the person we love. But, sometimes we fall for someone who feels right for us, instead of someone who is... and we end up hurting ourselves in the process.\n\nWe make mistakes, they make mistakes, and we have no clue how to handle the challenges that come with loving someone. We stick by our person through all of their mistakes because we want to believe something that simply isn't true. Hoping for a future that won't exist.\n\nYoung love is falling for someone we believe is perfect, despite the reality. That is the blessing of it. Learning from our mistakes, and growing into ourselves. Finding our ways in which we want to love and be loved. You can stick by the person you love, but never forget to stick by yourself first. \n\nYou are always worthy of to love, and of loving.",
