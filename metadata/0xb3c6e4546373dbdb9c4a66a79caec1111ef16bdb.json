    "name": "angels crossing the sky",
    "description": "First piece from the collection \"I am the way, the truth and the life\", inspired by the verse John 14:6 from the christian bible.\n\nFor years I have dreamed of these angels and lights crossing the sky. As a child I was raised in the Pentecostal Church in Brazil, and now I understand how this changed my imagination. Working to mend my childhood traumas is a difficult task, but I am on my way.",
