    "description": "Help us to collect aids for the victims of the military conflict in Ukraine. \n\nThis is the first video that opens the Pacific Tribute collection, where everyone can exhibit thematic works and send the proceeds to help the victims and personally maintain contact with them. \n\nThe money raised will be distributed as follows: \n\n60% - targeted support for specific families who have been left homeless and without means of livelihood. \n\nWe don't send money to general donation addresses, as large sums are collected there without us. But there are always people who, for various reasons, can't get help from official humanitarian services. \n\nIn our (https://t.me/uasosnow) and other telegram chats we find such people and guide them personally, providing information and material support up to complete safety and adaptation, including help with evacuation, finding housing and work.\n\n30% - to the author of the work\n\n10% - gas & promotion\n\n\nWhy this NFT will cost more in future:\nloveunion.io/pacific\n",
