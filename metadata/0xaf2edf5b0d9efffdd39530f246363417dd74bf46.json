    "description": "Unravel is a piece done with oil on canvas.\nIn this piece I try to put down an image I saw in my dream.\nLife is a broad spectrum we all have an inquisitive mind we are in a constant jamboree to find the truth, and true meaning or essence of life.\n\nThe maze like head is to illustrate that it takes effort and proper search of good knowledge to unravel, the red inner core represents our mind, its hidden within the maze and it controls affairs.\n\nThe lantern signifies knowledge, for you to exist and live a beautiful adventurous life you need knowledge, it could be in a particular field or endeavour, this will guide you and clear a better path and direction for your life.\n\nWe charge through life with every single sunrise, relentlessly we move someday wearingly  other days strongly.\n\nI wish you luck as you try to unravel life!\nThank You\n\nForeversammy ",
