    "description": "PLAYDAO is a series of digital assets created from ARTHaus PLAY - a weekly based community play to discover contemporary artists' DNA with the public of all ages in a unique way of art development program curated by Kiesly Tsang in order to unleash our inner creative child.\n\nIn this PLAY #2.1, we were practising the critical reception of Cindy Sherman! She is one of the greatest and most influential photographers from conceptual, staged as well as performance photography to explore issues from politics, gender, social space until her latest works since 2019, Sherman was making fun of her selfies wiping out subjects by using filters on the Instagram.\n\nHow to play: Children choose one of the filter options and the background they want to take the picture together with the golden Ikea frame, and we place the filter in front of the lens to make the photograph. \n\nWe hope you like the result of the game!\n\nFormat: 1080 x 1080 PNG\nBehind the Scenes: https://www.instagram.com/arthaushk",
