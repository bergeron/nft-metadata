    "description": "The art piece is created using 100% manual coding. \n\nThe art piece is based on different mathematical expressions, mainly Trigonometric functions such as Sine and Cosine values of an angle.\n\nThere is a total of 24 squares. 16 out of those are moving under the influence of the same mathematical formula, and 8 are moving with the reverse movement.\n\nThis art style is not to be confused with AI-generated art. This is pure manual coding and drawing and plotting x and y coordinates of the shape and influencing them using Trigonometry or Perlin Noise Algorithm",
