Family Style Meals. Pop Up Workshops. Magic Rainbow Unicorn School Bus?!?\n\nTouch grass already.\n\n\n------\n\nApril 20-23, 2023 at the Percy Priest Lake in Tennessee.\n\nEach NFT represents one ticket to Rizzlefest. \n\nBring your own camp, tent and sleeping supplies. \n\nor burn/redeem for a limited edition bunkrizzle, you'll have a twin bunk in one of the shared rustic cabins. \n\nRizzlefest is open April 20 at 4pm - April 23 at 12pm.\n\nTicket Includes Family Style Meals  \nThursday pm- Sunday am.\n\nMore information can be found https://netheryonder.xyz/inforizzle. \n\nMinted your Ticket?
