    "description": "Our first Manifold monthly collector airdrop! How berry exciting. Lettuce rejoice the arrival of the King and his Crew! 👑 [ERC1155 LFGROW] 🌱\n\nThis scene shows King Durian and his Royal Guard “Beet Root Stonewell” laughing it up in the FMC Royal Chamber. “What a pear-fect day doesn’t thou agree?!” 🍐⚱️\n\nPlum purples and corn golds shower the palace and rare mushrooms are littered everywhere. The smell from the King and his pungent shield & sword will scare you at first, but his sweet and royal aura will draw you in. 🛡🍄\n\n“Don’t worry, just let it mango” is their motto. Beet Root Stonewell will never let any danger enter the palace and is on juicy guard at all times. ⚔️✨\n\nALL HAIL KING DURIAN! 🫡👑🍃",
