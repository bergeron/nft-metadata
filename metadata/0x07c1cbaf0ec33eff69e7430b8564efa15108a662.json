    "description": "“We See Each Other” is the first collection in the “Towers'' series of photographs objectifying these looming physical conduits that blast data across the world, connecting us with each other.\n\n“We See Each Other” recognizes the enormous scale of both these physical structures and the virtual interactions they relay, neighborhood by neighborhood, every second of every day.\n\nThese photographs were taken on long, late night walks near the highest point in the Seattle area during the COVID-19 pandemic while I was on the Clubhouse app with a new breed of innovative creators sharing inspiring discoveries about the burgeoning NFT space.\n\nI’m fascinated by the juxtaposition and implications of high technology amidst nature, so these towers surrounded by trees in a local neighborhood park lured me in.\n\nI work within the constraints of relatively amateur toolsets. My camera is an iPhone 12 Pro Max using Night mode, which produces surprisingly clear results in the middle of the night when the stars are their brightest. The photo is unedited from the original capture.",
