    "name": "Baby Archimedes Observes the Displacement of Water",
    "description": "Archimedes, 287-212 BC, was an inventor, an engineer, an astronomer and possibly the first mathematical physicist. At the request of the king, he was to investigate whether a crown was truly gold. Entering the bath, Archimedes observed that the water overflowed in relation to its weight. This enabled him to determine that the jewelers tried to cheat the King by mixing silver in the crown.",
