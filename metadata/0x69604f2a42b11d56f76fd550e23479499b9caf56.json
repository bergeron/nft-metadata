    "description": "Omakases are hybrid creatures that may deliver pizza but they mostly offer you other sh@t because they are WTF.\n\nTheir Mission :  \nTo escape the Metaverse and live on crockery\n\nThese creatures are algorithmically assembled from a mouthwatering collection of artwork contributed by PizzaDAO community members. 314 artists submitted over 1000 individual pieces of artwork to create a delicious database of imagery that represents the kaleidoscopic global creative community that makes up the DAO. \n\nSince May 22nd 2021 PizzaDao has thrown the worlds largest #GlobalPizzaParty on #BitcoinPizzaDay.  \nIn celebration of our community members, Omakase Chef created this commemorative plate for 2023.\n\nOmakase Chef is an artist with an extremely structured, rules based approach to the creation of extraordinarily silly things.\n\nomakases.xyz  \nrarepizzas.com",
