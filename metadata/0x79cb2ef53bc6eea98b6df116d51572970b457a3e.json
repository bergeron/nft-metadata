    "description": "The story we’ll now present is called “Little Martians and the Human Memorial Monument”. It’s told by an ancient Martian, who simulated a human and played with it inside the Logged Universe. The Martian makes an effort of trying to explain this human where they came from and what is the nature of their reality. It’s quite touching, and we all know how this particular series of events sparked renewed interest in the human species across the galaxy. \n\nFor the creation of this story, we’d like to thank Simon de Rouviere, who is a very prominent researcher on the Logged Universe history and technology. We’d also like to thank Gene Kogan, for his AI collaboration expertise was key to simulate the narrated events in astonishing color and resolution. \n\nIf you would like to know more about our research or somehow contribute, please look at littlemartians.world\n\nHope you enjoy the show!",
