From real life moments to direct photos of a television screen, the motives of Person X are totally unclear.\n\nI've owned and loved these polaroids for years, and hope that somehow Person X can appreciate the new digital lease of life his their art now has.\n\nIf we somehow exist in the art we make, Person X surely lives here forever.",
