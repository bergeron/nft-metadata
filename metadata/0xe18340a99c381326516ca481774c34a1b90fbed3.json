    "description": "This is not only my first piece on Foundation, but also one of my personal favorite places to drive. Shelving Rock Road is hidden in the Adirondack Park traveling to Lake George. I was going to try and take some photos of the falls there but the snow was too thick for traveling that day. So, on my trek home earlier than planned I caught this moment the misty snow with the light just brings it all in. I hope you enjoy my first ever Foundation piece.",
