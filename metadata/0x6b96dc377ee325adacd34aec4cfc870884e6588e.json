    "description": "Sarah Gadon was in both my brother’s film, Antiviral, and my father’s film Cosmopolis, so she was in Cannes for the same stretch I was. Having done stills on both films, I had spent a lot of time with Sarah, and we had become very close friends. On this day I got to accompany her on a photo shoot with the legendary Peter Lindbergh, which was a thrill for me in so many ways. \n",
