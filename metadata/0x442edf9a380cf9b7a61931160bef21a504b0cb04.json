    "description": "The Rules: Make art with only what would be available after the apocalypse. \n\n\"Tallulah\" is a wild clay vessel made of unprocessed earth. Gathered from puddles that form along the long dirt roads in Northern Australia after the first rains of the monsoonal season.\nJust earth pushed and pulled into shape nothing else.\n\nTurkey Bush flowers are a 'pioneer plant' that only grow in places where they ground has been disturbed, the first to see beauty where others are yet to venture. They bloom a sea of pink for just a few weeks of the year until they are consumed by fire and descend back into the earth to wait again for the rain.\n\nMy pieces are deeply of their place, connected and designed to entice others to question how they see beauty in the world around them, even in the dirt under their feet.",
