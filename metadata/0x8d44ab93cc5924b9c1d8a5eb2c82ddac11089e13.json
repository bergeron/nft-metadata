    "description": "Shot during the first month of the pandemic.\n \nMy photos are usually characterized as having just as much focus on the location as on the model. Discovering new places is an integral part of my photography and storytelling process.\n \nAnd then the lockdown hit in early 2020, rendering me unable to create my art in the same way as I used to. This photo exemplifies the change I had to make as an artist during this time, creating more with less. In turn being able to see the light in the darkness and evolving as a creator because of it.\n \nThis image has become a staple of my work, becoming one of my best-selling prints, being featured in numerous local magazines and the cover photo of my website.\n \nThe model will of course be compensated, and all profits are fully reinvested in the creation of more art pieces which will increase in quality and complexity over time.\n \n4442 x 5552 pixels\n \nA single edition 1 of 1 NFT\n \nA high quality limited signed print will be included.",
