    "description": "\"The Dream of a Colonial Battle Flag as it passes Over Their Heads / The Grand Epitaph\" \nis an art piece by Zeshawn Luc that explores the missed opportunities for progress in the future. The painting depicts a horse suspended in motion speeding over the head of an individual lying in the grass, representing how ideas for a progressive future often pass over the heads of those who need to consider them the most.\n\nThe motion of the horse even causes the cigarette to light, reinforcing the pure power in the tenacity of the horse, burning an American flag into a spark as it passes, emphasizing the missed opportunities for progress and the cyclical nature of the struggles faced by those unaware of their part in the mutiny.\n \nThrough his use of powerful imagery and thought-provoking symbolism, Luc invites audiences to consider the missed opportunities for progress and the ongoing struggles faced by marginalized communities, though the work is always open to interpretation by the viewer.\n",
