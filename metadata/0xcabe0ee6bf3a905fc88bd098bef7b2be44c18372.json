    "description": "\"Timeless Joy\" is a testament to the power of art to evoke emotions and transport us to another place and time. Shot on Kodak TRI X film with the Hasselblad Xpan panoramic camera along the Malecón, the photograph has a timeless and classic look that enhances the nostalgic and romantic feel of the piece. The backdrop of the esplanade and old buildings in the distance creates a dreamy atmosphere, taking the viewer to another era. This photo was taken during my first of many trips to Cuba in 2017. The Malecón is a broad esplanade & sea wall stretching 8 kilometres along the coast in Havana.",
