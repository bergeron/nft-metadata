    "description": "I was gamble addict so bad  for 7 years. like I literally lost money that could buy me a 3 or 4 houses in those 7 years. and money is the last problem when you are addicted to gamble, you are loosing people and most important, yourself. But thanks to my  lovely wife I made it and quitted.\nI quitted almost 4 years ago. I slayed the demon and beheaded it!...  But, we all know demons are not so easy to kill and they will keep coming back in different shapes and forms.  But I'm always ready to meet them.  so this video is a little sketch that represents how your life loops when you are gamble addict and I made it to make my self always remember the life I had when I was addicted.\n\nMusic and sound, as always by me.",
