    "description": "Riding lizards, excited in anticipation of chasing the beast, easily ran through the snow. The riders who rode them were concentrated, not taking their eyes off the prey, only occasionally verbally calling to each other. Everything around sparkled and blinded the eyes: the high azure sky, clear, without a cloud; the white sun, the forest, covered with snow, like sugar icing, it would seem here, far from the cities, as if nothing had happened, no epidemic, no apocalypse. Only hunters and their prey.",
