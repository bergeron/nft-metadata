    "name": "Morning coffee with the Love cloud.",
    "description": "No matter where I go, love is always following me. \n\nSometimes she just casually drinks coffee in the cafe in the form of a cloud, I was luck to capture this blissful moment.\n\nIt happened in my favorite cafe Santa Crema in Sorocaba, the city where I lived in Brazil.\n \nI visited it pretty often, it was good space to focus and work accompanied by a delicious flat white and cozy atmosphere.\n\nAt Cafe Crema we had meetings my friend Katya, who was probably the only Russian-speaking person in that area of Brazil and luckily we found each other, later we even made business together.\n\nAnd then I left Brazil, but Cafe Crema and its vibe stayed with me as warm of memory.",
