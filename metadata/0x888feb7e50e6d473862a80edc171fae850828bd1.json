    "description": "Artist: Javier Alejandro Gonz√°lez Oliva. Ceramist and sculptor member of the Cuban Association of Artisans and Artists (ACAA) and the Cuban Fund of Cultural Assets (FCBC). He has participated on several occasions in the Havana Ceramic Biennial, where he is awarded in the category of Opera Prima in its XII edition. He is currently working on his project called Materia, in which design and ceramics come together. After 10 years of experience in ceramics, he moves his sculptures to the virtual world and finds the relationship between rendering and baking a piece of pottery. Now he sees polygons everywhere.\n\nDescription: Regardless of the perspective,  exist the event itself. Some watch in amazement as it is heated and boiled and others simply burn and strain, come out and sprout. Bitter taste of strained and forgotten coffee.\n\nEvery drop of coffee is fuel for Cubans worldwide; each NFT sale will help another Cuban artist.",
