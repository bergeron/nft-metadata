    "description": "May 23, 2022 - During the evening hours, a once in a lifetime spectacle occurs over rural Cochran County, TX. An EF-2 tornado nearly stretched a mile wide as it inhaled the west Texas dust. While most others had their view obscured by dust, I was able to get a clear view inside the blasting RFD (rear flank downdraft) winds. The dust mixes into the parent wall cloud, exposing the tendrils of the beast. Luckily, this tornado did very minimal damage and no casualties were reported. Many comments of this photo include referencing this to a tornado common in nightmares, hence the name of this piece. As of the day this was minted, this is the best tornado I've ever photographed in 15 years of trying.",
