    "description": "I love watching the stars parade overhead at the edge of the water, being at the ocean at night is something I've been familiar with from a very young age.\n\nMy earliest memory is of walking to the ocean with my dad during a storm. He called it a 'Midnight Mission' and it lives on in me as a small piece of magic and wonder I hope to pass on to my children some day.\n\nI was two years old.\n",
