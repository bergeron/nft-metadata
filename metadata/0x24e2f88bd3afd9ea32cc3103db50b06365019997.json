    "description": "The Between Brush and Lens collection is an abstract combination between the stroke of a visual artist and the lens of a photographer. Created through a hybrid process combining photography, digital technique, and a painter's thought process. Between Brush and Lens intends to free the mind towards a way of understanding that goes beyond the conventional and breaks free from reference in a significant way. The collection focuses on questions regarding artifice in color and naturalness in color, and how it does or does not belong in the environment.  Attracted to the basic vertical and horizontal elements of design Between Brush and Lens explores architectural structures in order to create dynamic and complex balances in each composition.",
