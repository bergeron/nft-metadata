    "description": "Dearest Red,\n\nIn times like this, I feel the need to let you know that I am not proud of letting you go. If anything, I regret it.\n\nToday when it rains, I remember us, drenched in the red glow of our love, young and carefree, a world awaiting us.\n\nSadly I am just a dream shattered escape now. \n\nYours \nWith love\nViolet\n\nIt's a letter to my teenage love that this picture reminds me of - a half-drenched  evening walk with her under a violet umbrella !\n\nActually, the vibe and beauty that gives birth to many poets and philosophers, the sound and gloom that takes away millions of hearts, the smell and spark that awakens the child from inside, we call it Monsoon.\n\nMonsoon (or the Rainy Season) stitches Indian Ocean islands and the Indian subcontinent into a single magic carpet where the splendour of sights and sounds, flora and fauna, cuisine and festivals display a stunning audio-visual in our mindscape.\n\nLocation - Tripura, India\n\nEdition - 1/1\n\nDimension - 3280 x 4920\n\nCamera - Nikon D500",
