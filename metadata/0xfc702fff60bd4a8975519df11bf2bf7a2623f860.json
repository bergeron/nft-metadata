    "description": "here we are on \"Abstract Whales‚Äù. After experiencing the \"Line of Life‚Äù for myself, this \"New World\" gave me new friends, hope and love from people that don‚Äôt even know me. It‚Äôs  about how from Crypto and trading, I went on to Art, meeting artists with similar philosophies, new friends with the same taste. Inspired by a whale a year ago, and this piece captures how I felt when I collected full emotions, happy times but in a dark way. Maybe that's the way I live or I like to live. Many eyes in web3, you must always \n be careful and vigilant. \n\nThat's the beauty about Distract Art, One piece of art can show you millions of themes, use your imagination you will reveal the story through your own interpretation.\n\nThank you.üñ§",
