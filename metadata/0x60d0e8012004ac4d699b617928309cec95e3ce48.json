    "description": "Mist can rather be called as a staple of the forest as it can be seen most of the time. This amazing tigress is seen most in the mistiest of mornings and it's a mesmerizing sight undoubtedly. Seeing her wandering off into the mist is a magical experience! This shot was a dream come true as you do not always get to see a tiger in the mist.",
