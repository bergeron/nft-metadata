    "description": "[Re-mint 20.5.2022]\n\n\nA mysterious mansion invited me in a dream. There was a girl with ruffled black hair wearing the lace I'd been wanting to wear all my life. She told me to play that piano for her.\n\nI tell myself as I spread my fingers across all the key notes.\n\nWhile feeling glad that I did what I couldn't.\nThe devil's hand from the piano came straight up and grabbed my body. it snatched my hair and pulled me into that piano body\nIt rips, crushes, destroys.\nwith laughter and sound waves that made me scream\n\nmy father is a musician\nMy sister plays instruments as well as her father, but I am not.\n\nI can't even in a dream",
