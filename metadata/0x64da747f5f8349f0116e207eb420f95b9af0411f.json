    "description": "Celebrating my first year in NFTs, \"Fifty Thousand Shots Moon\" is a commemorative Lunar image of which 40 editions were minted. \n\n\"Thousand Shots Moon\" was my genesis piece: almost one year later, NFTs sales have allowed me to upgrade my astrophotography setup and further develop my imaging style, paving the way for \"Fifty Thousand Shots Moon\", created with much more sophisticated equipment and processing techniques. \n\n50.000 frames were shot, stacked and processed into this 30 panel deep dive Lunar mosaic obtained through a 1800 mm focal lenght telescope.",
