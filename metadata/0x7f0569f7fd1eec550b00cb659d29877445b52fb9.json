    "description": "“’Ultraviolet’ is inspired by this idea of people being more than what you see on the surface, its this idea that some of the most interesting and complex people I know are not outgoing people, and the things that make us beautiful can take time to unpack and see.”\n\nUltraviolet is the first single from the IRL EP and is the only NFT from the collection to be released as editions.  \n\nInfusing his love for films, stories and human experiences, Sound Of Fractures shares honest and visceral experiences through his music.  Based around the idea of not taking things at surface level, “Ultraviolet” showcases the Londoner’s sophisticated sound and innate skill in crafting a sense of vintage nostalgia, whilst planting himself distinctly in today’s UK electronic music scene.\n\nShaped by the culture of UK dance music, hip-hop and soul, and based around the concept of finding beauty in imperfection, Sound of Fractures takes influence from the likes of Massive Attack, Jamie XX, Burial and Frank Ocean — sharing honest and visceral experience through music which takes an air of nostalgia through sound and imagery. \n\nAll Sound of Fractures NFTs give access to:\n\nGated Discord  \nBehind the Scenes  \nArtist Dao",
