    "description": "It was Thanksgiving weekend, 2015 - and two mfers were sitting around a table playing bananagrams. One mfer was my dad, certainly drinking a bloody mary and hitting his e-cig. Doing what he wants, as an mfer does. The other mfer was me, his son. Mfer dad tweeted a picture of my completed game, with a typo as a tipsy mfer would. His choice of hashtags is something to marvel at. He was always making sure that his son was winning, no matter what he did.",
