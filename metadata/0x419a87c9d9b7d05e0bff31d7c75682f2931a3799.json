    "name": "Loss Vegas - 2018 Crypto Mural",
    "description": "Krytpicrooks crafted a series of 64 single-frame comics inspired by the latest developments in the cryptocurrency realm of 2018. Subsequently, these illustrations were amalgamated into an 8-foot wide, 4-foot tall mural that serves as a tribute to the events of that year. It took eight months to complete. \n\nThe prominently featured mural, which has garnered significant attention on the front page of Reddit, showcases notable personalities within the crypto space, including but not limited to WendyO, Carlos Matos, Elon Musk and Ben Armstrong.\n\nDubbed as 'Loss Vegas,' the name was attributed to the challenging bear market that ensued after the 2017 cryptocurrency boom, causing numerous investment portfolios to suffer abrupt overnight losses of more than 40% in value.\n\nFractional Uprising Studios is auctioning off this historical mural to help fund Krypticrooks latest venture, a NFT battle royale called 'OpenSeason'. \n\nThe winner will receive all 64 one-panel comics and printed mural.",
