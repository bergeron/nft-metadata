    "description": "Burger Time, 2017. 4096 x 3277 px.\n\nScenes From an Untitled Film is a series of dark, cinematic photographs which depict everyday places that appear fictional and unreal. Blurring the line between truth and fiction, the glowing neon signs and dated architecture create a mysterious, nostalgic mood that feels out of step with the present. These lonely scenes are empty yet full of suspense, as though something is about to happen or just took place. This unsettling emptiness allows viewers to bring their own narratives to the image from memories and lived experience, films and photographs theyâ€™ve seen before, or their imagination.",
