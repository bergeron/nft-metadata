    "description": "Kaaarwan is a Persian word which means a \"Group of Desert Travellers\" \n\nThis image was taken in Pushkar, Rajasthan, India during the annual Camel Fair. Every morning a camel herder would march towards the fair ground with his herd of camels. The spot I selected to shoot was risky because I was literally standing on the edge of open septic tank and camels would run at extreme speed on a muddy path located slightly above my head. Their speed made it difficult for me to create composition because the shooting window was just 2-3 minutes beyond which the sun will rise above the camels.\nI could capture this on my 3rd attempt (3rd day early morning)\n\nLicense : Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
