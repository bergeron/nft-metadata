    "description": "For my upcoming album \"Rigmarole\" I have partnered up with the multidisciplinary artist Chris Kore to create a series of visual works for each track on the album.\n\n\nIn the words of Chris Kore:\n\"A series of Rigmarole loops open unique visual aspects of the mysterious modular creature by showing separate functional parts of it that reflects each track from the release.\nIt's a sacred birth of a modular creature. Slow, mysterious and meditative. Something is about to arise...Wait, did you just see that too?\"\n\n\nAnimation by Chris Kore\nMusic by Colin Benders\n",
