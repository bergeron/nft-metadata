    "description": "Water and earth soundscapes from the north.\n\nMaar World is an exoplanet located in the Cygnus constellation. It has four moons and two suns. \nThe inhabitants have adopted a trinary logic approach, that has enabled them to survive and thrive on their planet.  \nThe trinary logic allows the inhabitants to develop smart tools for integration with other species, to maintain harmony with the environment, and to defend their world. One example of this is the creation of ENTs, which are designed to bridge the gap between different species and cultures, fostering understanding and cooperation\n\nIntroducing the Sky Sounds Card Collection, a revolutionary set of ENT cards that unlock portals to Maar World. Immerse yourself in interactive ambient music,  download high-quality audio file, discover hidden storylines, and unleash your creativity with the Interplanetary Players. With 34 cards divided into three suits and a special wild card, this collection invites you to shape the narrative of Maar World. By collecting these cards, you contribute to the regeneration of biodiversity in Uruguay while supporting the independent development of this initiative. This endeavour promotes fair treatment for independent artists and envisions a future with balanced human-machine technologies. \n\nENT Cards propose a groundbreaking paradigm for music distribution, entangling physical and digital releases while encompassing music creation and listening experiences. Owners of these cards are granted a powerful license, allowing them to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material with proper attribution. Commercial utilization requires sharing of earnings among the new user creator (33%), original creators (33%), and the original nature regeneration project (34%). \n\nENT Collections available at https://collect.maar.world",
