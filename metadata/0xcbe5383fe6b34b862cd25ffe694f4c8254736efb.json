    "description": "- More than 1.3 million refugees have fled Ukraine till now, according to UN Refugee Agency, almost 200.000 being now in Romania.  \n- Many of the refugees are women, children and seniors as men between 18 to 60 are barred from leaving.  \n- The funds raised from these editions will be used for buying necessary things in refugees camps like : pillows, pacifiers, diapers, powdered milk, hygiene products, pills, food etc.  \n- To make sure that the donations reach the source, I will personally take care of their purchase and delivery to the NGOs but also to the refugee camps.  \n- I will keep you updated with photos/videos from my actions.\n\n#StrongerTogether  \n#SlavaUkraine\n\nPhotography made by Alexandru Chitu  \nDate : 05.03.2022",
