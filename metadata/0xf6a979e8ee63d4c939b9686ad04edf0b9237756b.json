    "description": "\"THE DREAM IS ALIVE.\" NASA\n\nA journey that transcends the boundaries of our planet, and takes us to the very limits of our imagination. A journey to a place where the beauty of our world meets the infinite mysteries of the universe.\n\nAs we journey to this incredible destination, we will be transported not only physically, but emotionally. For as we gaze out at the endless expanse of space, we will be filled with a sense of wonder and awe, a feeling that we are part of something much greater than ourselves.\n\nAnd this is where the concept of NFT space comes in. By using non-fungible tokens, we have the opportunity to create a new kind of relationship with space, one that is based on ownership and value. NFTs allow us to claim a piece of the universe as our own, and to hold it as a symbol of our connection to the cosmos.\n\nInspired on Notable Pepe, used  checks Media acquired under the license \"cco\" @Vince_Van_Dough  @jackbutcher\n\nall rights reserved on the original footage\n\nSkyWatcher\n\n\n ",
