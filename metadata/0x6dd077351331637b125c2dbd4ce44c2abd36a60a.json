    "description": "\"UnChecks\" (Derivative version of \"Checks\" by Jack Butcher) is made in the intention that all of us who don't have access to ease of verification in any platform or medium can express our feelings with each other.\n\nThe idea of creating \"UnChecks\" dawned on us when we found out that our country was not in the eligible list of countries that Twitter Blue's service is provided. In these times where authenticity of one's identity given by the blue checkmark is becoming increasingly valued, we were heartbroken to come to the realization that there are millions of us who cannot get verified and get services to all the privileges it offered.\n\nIf no one is verified, everyone is verified.  \nIf no one is notable, everyone is notable.\n\nA derivative of \"Checks - VV Edition\" by Jack Butcher",
