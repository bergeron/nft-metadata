Plus, our thoughts and feelings can manifest through them. \n\nHave you ever used your eyes as a weapon of seduction?\nCatch their gaze, make eye contact and let your eyes meet. Once you do this, move your eyes to the mouth and then to the other parts of the body. Let them feel you're attracted.\n\nWhen you get people's attention using eyes, only eyes, you're doing it right.\n\n2500*3125px\n300dpi",
