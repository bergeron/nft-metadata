    "description": "WheatPaste1 is derived from UncleSeize, SeizeJPGs, and 6529Seizing. These were the first three NFTs of Punk6529's \"The Memes by 6529\" collection. \n\nThe Memes Collection by 6529 is focused on the fight for the open metaverse (decentralization, community, self-sovereignty) and spreading this message to many people, many wallets.\n\nJust as 6529's Memes are inspired by historic propaganda and political posters, so too is WheatPaste1 inspired by how these messages were historically shared. Whether by centralized government, corporations, or by activists driving change, wheat paste has been used to spread these to the populace.",
