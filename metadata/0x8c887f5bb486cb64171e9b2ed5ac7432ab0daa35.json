    "description": "The history of this work is quite simple: in 2019 I did a lot of shooting, and this one was very successful, although it was done quite quickly through trial and error and was selected from more than 500 shots.\n\nTouch a piece of a naturally beautiful female body and feel all its tenderness, sophistication and aesthetics. â€¨Take care and love your women, no matter what.\n\n30% of the income from the sale of this NFT will go to charity - in support of orphanages in the city of Kyiv and other cities of Ukraine.\n\n1/1 Edition, Digital Photograph\nCollection: History of Nudes\nOriginal created: September 2021\n\nArtist: Sergey Fediv",
