    "description": "The trees need our help. They call on us to come back under their shade and help them. By doing this, we can help ourselves. I hope we will gradually return to nature. After all, we are genetically conditioned to know the power, beauty, and generosity of our \"green friends. When we feel bad, we intuitively reach out to nature, longing to remember the soothing song of the forest we heard as children. \n\nDigital NeoCubism.",
