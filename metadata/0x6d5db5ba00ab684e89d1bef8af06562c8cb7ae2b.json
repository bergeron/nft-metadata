    "description": "In the prologue to the book Better than fiction, Jorge Carrión has said: «Cities, countries, trips, the past, wars can be narrated through the portrait of the minimum» (Carrión, 2012: 28).\n\nIn this sense, the code can also narrate facts, landscapes, situations. Since I dedicated myself to creating visual representations with code, I have discovered the potential to tell small stories. An exercise that I often do is to observe something from everyday life and recreate it through code.\n\nThis is not the first time that I represent cities with code. My first work was Glitch City, a very successful generative project. This time I wanted to do something different. To the city, yes, but from a more colorful and vast perspective, almost like a caricature. Each city is unique in color and pixel composition.\n\nMade with code.\nArt by Daniel Oropeza\nTwitter: @ferdoropeza\n",
