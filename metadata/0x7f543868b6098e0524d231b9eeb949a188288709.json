    "description": "The Death Knights are those responsible with bringing down the Dark Mages who are together conjuring a spell to save all of humanity from the grips of death. These knights ride their dead stallions across the universes of Kratu in search of the Enlightened ones. These Dark Mages usually reside inside caves and abandoned lands peacefully away from the war torn planets outside the Kratu universe, the key to saving all of existing life lies in the hands of the Dark Mages. But Death wishes for all to join her hell army and the Death Knights are the weapon of choice.",
