    "description": "“And however, what you didn’t learn in School was that Lilith was supposedly created before Eve.\n\nLilith was created at the same time as Adam.\n\nShe was created from the same earth that Adam was created from, which represents a much different image of woman than Eve’s story does. Unfortunately, poor Adam just couldn’t handle Lilith and thus Lilith ran away from Eden to have her own freedom. \n \nBe cruel when needed. Be gentle when you can. Demand respect, and if you are not given it, take it. They try to raise us as sheep, but you are a wolf.\n \nA wicked women takes what is hers. She dissolves what is in her way. She is a witch-woman; she is a demon. \n\nIn a world full of Eves, we need so many more Liliths.\n\nShe is Lilith.”\n\nFormat: MOV 4K\n",
