    "description": "CADAF x IO Collection: [Upgrade Ability](https://infiniteobjects.com/products/cadaf-x-io-collection-martin-lukas-ostachowski) explores the overlooked threat of the ability to upgrade smart contracts. Apart from the risk of a flawed upgrade, an overwhelming number of smart contracts can be upgraded by a single externally-owned wallet address. This precarious centralization is one of hackers' most common attack vectors — a metaphorical idiom that eludes everyone’s concern.\n\n[This collection](https://infiniteobjects.com/collections/cadaf-and-infinite-objects-intimate-visions) brings together a leading group of artists who create a distinct visual language and representations of their surrounding space. Together, these artworks generate a universe of its own, from impossible architecture, visions of the sky, poetic notions, dreamlike landscapes and intimate objects. This collection invites viewers to experience and explore a modular universe inspired by art and technology. \n\nCADAF and Infinite Objects are proud to bring this special collection to life. All artworks will be available as an edition of 22, with physical and digital presence (Infinite Object Display + NFT).",
