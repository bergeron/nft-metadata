    "description": "This piece is inspired by the Westward Expansion\n\nThe road trip throughout the West, through the Great Plains toward the last bastion of untamed America. A time scarred by the war between Indigenous people and the continuing onslaught of European settlers. The mix of bright colors and the fire effect captures all the perils, sickness, bad horses, and bandits. Families and wagons undertaking the arduous journey West, fleeing poverty to seek a better future in America's promised land.",
