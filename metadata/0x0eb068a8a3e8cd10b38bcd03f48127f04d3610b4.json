    "description": "Title: The Promise\n\nArtist: Nilus J. Dantes\n\nDimensions: 6240 x 4160\n\nThis photo is the fulfillment of a promise i made to a friends grandfather two years after he passed away.\n\nHe was a kind, embracing and gentle soul that loved my Black & White photography. One day he told me “I’d love to see a sunset photo in color from you” and i promised him that i'd show him the first sunset photo in color taken by me. Heartbreakingly so hard times befell him and he passed shortly after.\n\nA part of me wishes i would've taken the first sunset photo i saw so that i could've shown him in person but i waited because i wanted it to be perfect and something we both could be proud of. My patience however was not without sacrifice.\n\nThis photo is for you, my word is my bond and i'm sorry i never got the chance to show you in person but it’s here now and i hope wherever you are, you're proud of this.",
