[03.22.23]\n\nInfluence will change over time to reflect my Twitter following as it grows (or stagnates or shrinks).  I plan to manually update the metadata (image + text) at least twice a year until my death or the death of Twitter. \n\n(Unless Sold) The price of Influence will also change by increasing (or decreasing) by 1 ETH for every 1k followers that I gain (or lose) over time. \n\nAll aspects of Influence (image iterations + concept) are CC0.",
