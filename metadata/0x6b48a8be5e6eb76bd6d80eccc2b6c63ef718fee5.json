    "description": "AnubisFX: Creative Symbols ☥\n\n[ɴᴏᴄᴛᴜʀɴᴀʟ𝐍𝐈𝐑𝐕𝐀𝐍𝐀] is an anomaly that a few of us receive when the sun goes down and the moon appears through the darkness. When the tide of the sea rises up and is at its peak, what do you think the water in our bodies do? I’ll leave that up to you, but my creativity heightens and this uncontrollable feeling to create comes over me. Like a uncontrollable need to sneeze. Needing to release this adrenaline, this anxiety ridden feeling. I wanted to captivate this ɴᴏᴄᴛᴜʀɴᴀʟ𝐍𝐈𝐑𝐕𝐀𝐍𝐀.\n\n©AnubisFX",
