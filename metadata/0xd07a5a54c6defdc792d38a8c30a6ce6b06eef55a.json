Mandalas are used in a number of different spiritual traditions to help practitioners and adepts concentrate, as a means of receiving spiritual guidance, to create a sacred place, and to facilitate meditation and trance induction.  A mandala typically depicts the spiritual journey from the outermost point to the innermost point through layers.",
