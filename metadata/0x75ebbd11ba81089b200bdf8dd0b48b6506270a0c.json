    "description": "In 1966, at the age of 74, Alma Thomas painted *Resurrection*, a work that exemplifies her expressive and joyous color abstractions.\n\nThomas was a pioneering artist who is recognized as one of the great American painters of the 20th century. Thomas was the first student to graduate from Howard University’s art department, and the first Black woman to have an exhibit at the Whitney. In 2014, *Resurrection* became the first artwork by an African-American woman to enter the White House’s permanent collection.\n\nAs part of the Grails II collection, in partnership with The White House Historical Association and Iconic Moments, Linda Dounia Rebeiz's *Sparrows Do Not Fear the Sun* was inspired by *Resurrection* and Alma Thomas's story.\n\nAll *Resurrection* tokens are bound to a corresponding *Sparrows Do Not Fear the Sun* token, meaning that the former cannot be transferred independently. This means that only owners of *Sparrows Do Not Fear the Sun* can ever be owners of *Resurrection*."
