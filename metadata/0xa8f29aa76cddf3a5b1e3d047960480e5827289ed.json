    "description": "In 1949, he lay weeping, \nHis soul captured for a moment in history,  \nAll whitened head to toe.\n\nHe did not know why warmth entered his mind  \nFlowed to his heart and gut  \nAnd back to turn his howling mouth to a toothless smile…\n\nIn 1949, she hovered grinning with full understanding,  \nHer soul enraptured infinitely and frozen with no history.\n\nIn four dimensions and colors from head to shining soul  \nShe knew exactly why, the warmth flowed from her mind through that darkened hole  \nDown to his heart and gut  \nAnd back up to turn her grinning mouth to a toothless pearlescent smile…\n\nShe nor he remembers this now, \nBut I do…\n\nFIN  \n-----------  \nPak, thank you for inspiring me to create and make poetry a central theme in my work. As noted in my tweet below, I believe Lost Poets is a poetry form and collection that is possibly your greatest work and contribution to the canon of humanity...I can only hope and will certainly strive to even contribute a fraction of what you have and will in this lifetime and beyond.\n\nTweet on this topic for posterity: https://twitter.com/TheDigitalCoy/status/1503037089125859334?s=20&t=nkCnU4weajP64grPBvqOIg\n\nThank you and I hope to someday knowingly meet you in-person IRL.\n\nBest,\n\nTheDigitalCoy\n\n##WeAcceptAsh",
