    "description": "daddy's money was designed as an all expenses paid trip for you and your friends to fly to sonic paradise. made with only luxury materials from London, Paris, New York, and Amalfi, there's no better way to bring you and your special someone to that sweet, summer soaked place you could only dream of before.\n\nright before i left for europe on my own i had mallory over to my place in venice beach, and we cooked this up real quick and then i took off. when i got back i realized it sort of fit perfectly into the world of daddy's money, it was ethereal and just sounded like being in the clouds on the way to paradise, sipping champagne and ginger ale.",
