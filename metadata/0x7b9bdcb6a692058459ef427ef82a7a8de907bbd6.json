    "description": "My first animated piece. I have been so inspired by some of the amazing art I have seen in the Web 3 space that I really wanted to try it for myself. Being a street photographer, we are often limited to what's in front of us despite our imaginations envisioning vast scenes in front of us; especially as I dream up futuristic cyberpunk city scapes in my mind. I can now take my photos and present my imagination through animation. Stay tuned, I have many more ideas and photos that I wish to work with.",
