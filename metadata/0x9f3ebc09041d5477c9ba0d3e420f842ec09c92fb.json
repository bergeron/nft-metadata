    "description": "The ocean currents are a visual representation of gravity, a pulling force that’s rhythm balances the planet. These circular ocean forms called “gyres” act as conveyor belt by helping to circulate water around the planet. These stabilizing forces have become a repeating theme within the artist Maxwell N. Burnstein’s collages and are symbolic for his first edition. The artist hopes this artwork creates its own momentum and brings positive change for collectors.",
