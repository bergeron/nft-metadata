    "name": "Shaded Shame",
    "description": "Over a decade of my life was controlled by eating disorders and the shame I felt from it. Shame lives loudly in the head and the secrecy and loneliness made life feel unbearable at times. Throughout my years of healing, I have found that sharing these shames has been imperative to my recovery. I hope that by doing so, I can also bring comfort and encouragement to anyone who has experienced similar struggles.",
