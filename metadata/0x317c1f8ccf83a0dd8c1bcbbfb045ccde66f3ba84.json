    "description": "There’s an ancient mnemonic technique called the “Memory Palace” that consists in mentally recreating a visual path of well-known places to associate them with a list of new elements positioned along the way in order to remember specific things.\n\nInspired by this technique, I’ve initiated a timeless photographic project in the form of a visual book about memory, the way we access to our mind, and how we try to remember important events we've lived.\n\nFrom years of work.\nIn both films and digital.",
