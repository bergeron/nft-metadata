    "description": "The block is hot. An intricate plot. To have us locked. With no where to go. They Rather have us shit there and rot. While they sit there and watch. Red and blue tops streets. Set to a doo-wop beat. The jungle of concrete, where nothings beyond reach. Blue and white’s patrol the waters, like a pack of great whites. Refused our Miranda’s. Who this Miranda anyway.",
