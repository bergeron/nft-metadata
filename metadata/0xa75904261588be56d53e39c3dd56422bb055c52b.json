    "description": "1/1 \n\n\"Working Man\"\n\nThis was taken on the streets of Japan. I had just landed in Tokyo the night before. Jetlagged, I decided to take a stroll around the hotel. It was 5 AM. The sun had just peaked over the tall, overarching skyscrapers and bled onto the street. I saw this gentleman walking towards me. He was heading to work. I think we could all relate to this man. Up before everyone else, paying the dues - hoping that one day it will all pay off. This photo is one of my favorite photos that I have captured during my time in Japan. \n\nMy T:ME JPN collection is based on a series of photographs I've shot throughout my career as a freelance photographer. These photographs are 1/1 not because no one else has them but simply because it is a snapshot of a time that we can never get back.",
