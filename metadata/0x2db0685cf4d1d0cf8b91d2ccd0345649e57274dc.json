The series of operations culminating in the incorporation under the Laws of Ontario of Noranda were started in August, 1922, when claims staked by Edmund Horne in Rouyn Township, Quebec, were optioned by a syndicate formed a few months previous for the purpose of exploring promising areas, the acquirement of claims and the general development of mining properties.
