    "description": "This piece was birthed from a mental slump. I found myself in trapped a funk that I had no idea how to get out of.\n\nThere I was, months into a funk I couldn't escape from and for some reason, at 3 AM, I was sat on my bed browsing the internet looking at pictures of couches. Then my mind thought of the quote \"Life doesn't come with a remote, you've got to get up and change\" and instantly I had ideas running through my brain.\n\nIt was like I was looking at myself, seeing couches made me think of the times I would spend sitting on them alone with my thoughts. It's as if my brain was telling me to snap out of this funk.\n\nSo I refused to go to sleep and started creating this piece late at night and it ended up helping me snap out of the funk and also ushered in a new style in my art. I guess in the end, for me to take back control of my thoughts, my art was the key.",
