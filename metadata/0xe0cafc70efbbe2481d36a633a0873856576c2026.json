    "description": "This piece was created in April, 2022. Being the beginning of my new journey.\n\nI always struggled with finding a style that best allowed me to express myself. I wonder if it’s related to my difficulties of understanding self.. or maybe my chameleon personality. Contrary to the title, loving myself comes quite easily. At the time I did take a five month hiatus from art. With the intention of learning how to not compare myself with other artist. However, knowing that didn’t stop me from pestering myself. Thinking to myself I was lazy for not creating. So I guess it was difficult loving myself when both parties had conflicting interest. The part of me that craves ambition doesn’t quite mix well with my lay back personality. \n\nFor those who placed a bid my SR genesis I want to give you this. As a thank you for believing in me. As a thank you for trusting me … even though at times when my intention don’t seem clear. I learned it not what one say but what one does. I will forever show my gratitude with action to those who believe in me. I couldn’t be where I am today or where I will be without your support. So thank you.",
