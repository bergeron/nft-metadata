    "description": "A quick, summer weekend in Bologna for a wedding and I had two hours to wander the center of Bologna before I needed to change gears and get my suit on. On the hunt for an espresso and pizza in the city center, the reflections in this Jewelry store window caught my eye and as I moved closer, the Jeweler himself appeared at just the right moment and I took my shot. A second later he was gone and so was I, pleased with my treasure from Bologna. \n\nTitle: Treasured Occasion\nEdition: 1/1\nArtist: ERIK WITSOE\nDimensions: 5500 x 3681\nLocation: Bologna, Italy\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
