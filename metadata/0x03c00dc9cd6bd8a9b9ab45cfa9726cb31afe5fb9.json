    "description": "This work pays tribute to solid-state televisions, radios and stereos, and the second-hand electronics stores that provided inspiration for Kristen's early work with video and sound. Solid-state devices gained popularity when they replaced bulky electronic devices with vacuum tubes and moving parts. The term signifies a moment in time in which change was happening at a revolutionary scale, and the beginning of the world of portable electronics that we inhabit today. The term has also come up again more recently, with the emergence of solid-state drives that  to used to store and back up digital work.\n\nThis piece also references 68k Macintosh isometric clip art, and the techniques associated with vintage software, such as color cycling. The initial images were created with Deneba UltraPaint for Macintosh. \n\nGIF, 640x512(x2), 2023",
