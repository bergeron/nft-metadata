    "description": "Originally published as a modern day translation of ‘Silly Walk’, this photo gained an increasing online exposure as the ‘Unpopular Opinion Puffin’ meme from 2013 and onwards. Besides being a technically advanced photo, taken at the Treshnish Isles in Scotland, the posture of the bird led to a wide variety of interpretations across its audience and the internet, taking position as an important meme of its time.\n\nThe photo was published in newspapers of The Times, The Daily Mirror and in magazines of the Borealis Press, Avanti Press and TV Hören und Sehen.\n\nThis authentic NFT including the original resolution of the 'Unpopular Opinion Puffin' photo is offered by Andreas Mulder. The resolution is 3064 × 2043 pixels.",
