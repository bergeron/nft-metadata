    "description": "Remember Us VI honours six French painters of the 18th century Marie Denise Villers, Rose Adélaïde Ducreux, Elisabeth Louise Viglée Le Brun, Anne Vallayer-Coster, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard and Marie Victoire Lemoine. All six female painters were leading the way forward for 18th century women and their works are collected by museums worldwide but often they never get the same attention as their male counterparts. \n\nRemember Us is our series which honours overlooked women throughout art history.",
