    "description": "LoopieLooNFTs == 9,663 (phone code for WOOF) dog portraits living their best lives out on the fringes of the Ethereum blockchain. These feral NFTs can't be controlled with any so-called \"roadmap,\" restrained with any \"utility,\" or confined within some boring web2 \"website.\" An @LoopieLooNFT Twitter account occasionally reporting their whereabouts is about all they will abide. LoopieLooNFTs are basically a giant pack of badass cattle dogs roamin' the chain, herdin' all the straggler 1/1 varmints they find along the way, just for sport. Each trippy doggo's digital frame adds a touch of class to these wild beasts; they'll stand out as fine, presentable, attractive modern-art additions to degen ETH wallets worldwide. Noble as the pups are, each one of course features not one, not two, but *three* Shakespearean quotes related to dogs. And defiantly setting them apart from anything else in the canine metaverse, each LoopieLooNFT bears a unique name generated from more than 1,000 possible words. As for rarity, surely some underutilized bot will swing by and sort out the pack hierarchy, as there are definitely some alpha dogs herein. And hey, if you mint or acquire one, please howl at the ol \"wen moon\" by tweeting out your doggo's name, tagging @LoopieLooNFT.",
