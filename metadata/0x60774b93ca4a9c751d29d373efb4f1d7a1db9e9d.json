    "description": "Magna Mutatio is a series of artworks that explore the transformation of selected territories over time, including the transformation of cities, landscapes, bodies of water and glacial formations. Magna Mutatio Helheim Glacier focuses on the transformation of the Helheim Glacier in southeast Greenland.\n\nHelheim Glacier is the fastest moving glacier on the east coast of Greenland, located near Sermilik Fjord. It has an average width of approximately 6.5 km and the beginning of the glacier front has experienced rapid changes over the last twenty years. It first retreated by approximately 6.5 km in the early 2000s, but later partially regained its length and regained more than 3 km.\n\nThe artwork Magna Mutatio Helheim Glacier uses satellite data from the European Space Agency, in particular the Copernicus datasets that retrieve records from the Sentinel 1-5 satellites.  In the generative video, the acquired data is represented by a pigment dissolving over time. In this way, a macro view of the six-year transformation of this rapidly changing glacial formation is made possible.",
