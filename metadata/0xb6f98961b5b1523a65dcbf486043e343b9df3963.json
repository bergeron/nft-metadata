    "description": "Polaroid SX70. Portraits of people or groups approached in the street or on a path. At a bus stop, in a field...  Each time, a single image. I like the expectation of this picture. An expectation\nshared with the people photographed. The randomness of the image, the instability. \nDuring the trip, and afterwards, the black and white photographs took on tones. A little yellow, a little pink... I kept these tints when they were scanned\n\nBuy and get a fine art print 20X20cm",
