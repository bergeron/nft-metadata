But just like any quality flower, after harvest, she needs time to cure before she can release her magic! What's that? You've never cured flower before? Well no worries, we have just the thing for that. Stake your Jar O KatNip in the vault for 3 months, dont worry about checking for moisture, we will handle all off that, and in 3 months time, she'll be ready to work her magic.",
