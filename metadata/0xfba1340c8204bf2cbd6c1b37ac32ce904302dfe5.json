    "description": "I went out to the beach late one night with my family to do some light painting of letters with glow sticks to spell out a special birthday wish to a friend. After they had packed up and went home, I stayed on the beach and wandered for a while looking for possible astrophotography compositions. As I was walking beneath the pier, an interesting scene caught my eye. It wasn’t the symmetrical nature of the pillars, but the way the low level of light was hitting the underside of the pier, which when combined with the shadows and the diminishing perspective of the pier and pilings, created this naturally formed “X” centered in the frame, accentuated by the contrast of this black and white conversion.
