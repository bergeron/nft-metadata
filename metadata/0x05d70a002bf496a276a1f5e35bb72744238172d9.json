    "description": "The inspiration for my artwork, \"Cry of the Lost,\" was drawn from a touching scene in the Korean series \"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.\" In this scene, the guardian and the bride bid farewell as he scatters into pieces, leaving the girl in tears. This emotional moment deeply moved me, and I sought to recreate it in my artwork with a unique twist. My version features the same pose with scattered pieces, but I changed the environment to include a mountain backdrop, a big pink moon, and a blue-white sky with large, chunky clouds. A lonely tree on the left adds to the somber atmosphere, emphasizing the sense of loss and loneliness that the artwork conveys. The title, \"Cry of the Lost,\" reflects the literal crying of the girl and the underlying feelings of grief and despair. Through the use of textures and noises, I aimed to intensify the emotional impact of the artwork and to leave a lasting impression on the viewer.",
