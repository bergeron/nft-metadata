    "description": "A mirror can show our inner personality, and that is what we can understand, we are relaxed, we enjoy the first days of our lives, but after a while, what happens makes our soul hurt, The soul is like a mirror, the more blows, the more the mirror is scratched, and if things are not stopped, the mirror becomes full of scratches, and we can no longer see ourselves in the mirror, in fact I forgot myself, in pain and Torment",
