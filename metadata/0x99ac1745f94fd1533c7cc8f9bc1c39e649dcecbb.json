    "description": " The Story of Art \n\n A deep gaze flows, piercing through the maze of reality, the eye sees a multitude of appearances, the invisible concealment is declared by the heart. The owl takes off at dusk and sees everything that has happened during the day. All the marks of the birds' flight, the trails of the mountains and rivers, the glimpses of the hovering islands, the soaring of the water... All objects are visible in the light, observed in the dark, static, dynamic, manifold, fictional, and artificial. They linger wherever they pass, and wherever they linger is scenery.  "
