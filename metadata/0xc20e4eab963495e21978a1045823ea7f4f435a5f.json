    "description": "DIVERGE was founded by a Ukrainian and 80% of the team are Ukrainians. Due to the full-scale WAR with Russia, who aggressively invaded our country we decided to focus all our efforts on charity projects. \n\nWe stand for our country and we do everything we can to help our relatives, team members, friends, and people of Ukraine to survive in these terrifying times. We all need to ACT, be united and help as much as we can. Today we are launching this charity initiative “Diverge for Ukraine - Children for Peace” to STOP the Humanitarian Crisis.\n\nWe were inspired by Ukrainian kids drawings at the protests all over the world, with a call to STOP THE WAR! We are releasing them now as an exclusive NFT collection and you can own a unique 1:1 NFT piece with historical meaning and a DIGITAL PROOF of your CONTRIBUTION. 100% of proceeds from these auctions will be donated directly to small charity and volunteer organizations to speed up the process of receiving the funds by people in Ukraine in need",
