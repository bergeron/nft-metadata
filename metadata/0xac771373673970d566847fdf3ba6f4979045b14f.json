    "description": "This is my hometown. A small island called Puerto Rico. Where I grew up since the age of four and planned out my dreams. This is where I ran so much to the point where I would get sand on my parents' belongings. I built castles or dug holes so deep to create my own beach because I was so determined of creating a world of my own. This is where I learned how to defend myself against the ocean. Swimming all day till my eyes got red. A small island, yet it felt so big. I was just a kid with big dreams. And well now, theyâ€™re faded dreams.\n\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLicense: NFT holder is free to use on social media, private display, and in virtual galleries, as long as the creator is credited.
