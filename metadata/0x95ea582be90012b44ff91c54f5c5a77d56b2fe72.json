    "description": "\nI took this photo in 2015 in a village in Turkey . New born lambs are best friends of children that lives in villages. When I went to this village to document the life in village, i heard voices of children and lambs. These voices came from a barn and when i walked through the door of the barn, I saw these children playing with the lambs. The sparkle of happiness in the eyes of the children impressed me a lot. I tried to reflect this happiness in my photo. I am happy to have taken such a beautiful and lovely photo. I named this photo \"The Lamb and the Children\". \n\nPhotographer: Fatih Ã‡indemir.\n\nCamera: Canon EOS 70D\nLens: Canon 24-105 mm\nLocation : Ankara / Turkey\nDate : 08. 04 .2015\nDimensions: 4000*2666 300 dpi\nEdition: 1/1",
