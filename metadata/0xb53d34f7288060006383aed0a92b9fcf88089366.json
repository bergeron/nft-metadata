    "description": "This painting was conceived in 2015 as an oil painting. It was the first from my long series of paintings called Human Extension in which I explored the relationship between man and technology. \n\nIn 2022, in order to create this edition of 50 ERC-721 tokens, I took this painting and further reiterated it digitally using digital software like Photoshop and Procreate. \n\nPersonal Particle Accelerator is inspired by the LHC ( Large Hadron Collider). I took that concept and created this particle accelerator for the common people, with entertainment purposes in mind. Just like a VR headset, this machine offers a glimpse into another world, the world of subatomic particles!!",
