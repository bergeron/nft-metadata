    "description": "Evening turns to night as the calm waters of Bosphorus accompany the ship we're in. Silent rides the passengers. Destination known in a future unknown. Water laps, the sound melts in to the mildly calm summer air. As we trod by the Bridge and Tower, moments turn in to vortices where each vortex is a story untold. Where each vortex purposefully hides behind its own currents of deception. \n\n2020 Istanbul, Turkey",
