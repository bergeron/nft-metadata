    "description": "Do you know the tales of the magnificent creatures that inhabit the dimensions beyond ours?\n\nThis is the story of Third Eye Alice, a girl who fell down a hole and stumbled upon a gateway between worlds. A dimension that, if properly navigated, would allow her to unlock access to infinite realms beyond her own.\n\nAlice's fall initially left her unconscious. When she awoke she slowly stood up and regained her footing. She glanced around and found herself in a terminal of sorts. As her hand brushed the hair from her brow she felt something familiar but strangely out of place. A Third 'All-Seeing' Eye had emerged and granted her sight where others would be lost in the pitch black.\n\nAlice's Third Eye miraculously revealed a mysterious key floating in front of her. She grasped for it, and the key began to glow, as it pulled her along a series of illuminated panels towards a rotating object cast in shadow.\n\nAnd so began Alice's journey through time and space. Some say pure luck had granted her such a gift. Others, however, say she was destined for it.",
