    "description": "Deep in the heart of the Psychedelic Swamp lies a fortress like none other. The Swamp Citadel, is a gigantic melting skull with a terrarium dome that houses a small city. Here, the Psychedelic Swamp Squad, a group of misfits who love swamp weed and mushrooms, call home. With powers fueled by the psychedelic slime found in the swamp, they defend their home from the vile mutations that haunt the wetlands. \n\nCreated by Mobsolete 2023 - 5400x7200 pixels - 300dpi - PNG",
