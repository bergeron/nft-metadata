    "description": "My Written Meaning for this Artwork:\n\n\"In parts of the world, many changes occur in the cycle of a year. Elements ravage elements, things die, layers shed, and often the whole of everything transforms and is born anew. To bear witness to it implies a particular privilege, a steadfastness lent to us only by what must be a hurricane of grace.\"\n\nMedium:\nDigital photography - My approach is to offer the closest representation of the exact scene I witnessed with my own eyes, without fanfare. The magic of nature is plenty on its own. Therefore, I make the minimal adjustments required to bring the image to this state of integrity.\n\nWhere & When I Created it:\nSquamish, BC Canada 2021\n\nFile Information:\nJPG 6000x3478px at 72dpi RGB\n\nMy Website:\nlucasgaudette.com",
