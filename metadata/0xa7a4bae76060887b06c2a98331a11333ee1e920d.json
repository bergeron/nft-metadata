    "description": "Itâ€™s a collection of uncanny images unbothered by logic, place, or time. Provoking feelings of discomfort, marvel, and most of all confusion. A strange, odd and absurd dreamlike depiction that is short of any answers. I use dream logic to blur the lines between contradictions: past, present, living, dead, waking, and sleeping. This is an attempt to think about the concept of perceiving what is visible and what is not. ",
