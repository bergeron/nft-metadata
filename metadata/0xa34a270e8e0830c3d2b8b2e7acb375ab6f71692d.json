    "description": "Yusuke Toda was born in Tokyo in 1991. Graduated from Tama Art University, Department  \nof Painting, majoring in oil painting.  \nIn her recent works, she expresses everything with the character \"YUM\" and  \nShe depicts a unique painting space centering on the black-and-white character named  \nYUM.  \nHe is always happily playing alone in his paintings.  \nStarting from existing portraits, he constructs his paintings by collaging images of clouds,  \nanimals, people, and plants.  \nThe paintings express how we, the viewers and the environment around us, willingly  \ninteract with each other and live in harmony.",
