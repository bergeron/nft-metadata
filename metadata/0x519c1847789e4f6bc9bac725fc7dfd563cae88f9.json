    "name": " Pain and hope of Ukraine",
    "description": "This painting shows the pain and suffering of my Ukrainian people and at the same time the hope for a brighter future.\nIt is definitely not something I would like to post this spring day. Women's Day. I am sure you all know the horrors are happening right now on the territory of my beloved and native country of Ukraine. It all seems like a nightmare, it is completely beyond my mind that something like this could be happening in 2022.\n\nFor my part, as an artist and as a woman, I am doing my best to help all those Heroes who defends me, my country's territory and its values. All money raised from the sales will go to help the Ukrainian Army.",
