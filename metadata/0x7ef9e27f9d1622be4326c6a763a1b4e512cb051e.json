    "description": "We can't integrate something that we can't perceive. \nWe can't perceive something if we keep thinking about ourselves as just a body,\nWe can stop limiting our mind to only things tha have a concept because... the life is just a concept\nA concept that we build from our environment and experiences and... What happens when we grow in a environment that just bring us experiences that are not able to help our mind develop beyond the concept?\nThen we are not living, we are just experimenting the concept from someone else... and deep inside me something is telling me that before we give to something a concept... was something manifesting energy,\nAnd we are not even able to understand it, because we can't perceive it... because we are so distracted with concepts that we lost the chance to integrate the the shadow to the light.\nWith this piece of art, I want to remember you wherever and whoever you are, that we are energy, not a concept...",
