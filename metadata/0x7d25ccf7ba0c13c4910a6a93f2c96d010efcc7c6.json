    "description": "Get ready for an adrenaline-fueled experience like no other with our project that challenges you to deploy game theory and win big! Introducing \"Vault Games\" - a game that puts your strategic thinking to the ultimate test.  \nTo get started, simply mint 1 to get a key that grants you access to the vault. But that's not all - 50% of the proceeds from every mint go directly into the vault, which means the stakes are high right from the get-go.  \nOnce the vault is activated for game night, half of its contents are up for grabs, and the value can either skyrocket or plummet depending on your strategic moves. With games running at least three times a week for two weeks, you'll have plenty of opportunities to flex your game theory muscles and come out on top.  \nAnd that's not all - after two weeks, you'll have the option to accept the value of your key or take on an even bigger challenge that we'll reveal later. The choice is yours!  \nSo, what are you waiting for? Open mint is now live, and you can decide how much value you want to start the games with. With the potential to increase the value of the vault and win big, it's time to let the games begin. Are you ready to take on the challenge and come out on top?  \n",
