    "description": "She is a Nymph. Her home is rivers and lakes. It has all shades of green and blue, it is semi-dark and peaceful. Nothing disturbs her cosy peace... but\n\nOne day the Great Change comes. Nymph's Nature begins to change. She opens up like a ripe flower. The Nymph knows nothing of the dawn, she simply begins to ascend to where her familiar world ends. She moves towards the air, but she has never breathed before... She moves towards the sun, whose rays have never touched her body before... She leaves the water, to which she will never return... The Nymph chooses to be someone else... but she does not yet know who... She stops be a Nymph.",
