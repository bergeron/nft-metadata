    "description": "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" \n(A. Einstein)\nThis illustration shows what can be beyond the earthly mind. Somewhere far away, in other star systems, other galaxies, or perhaps in worlds invisible to us.\nWith the help of our imagination, we can create these worlds that will live through the fine arts for many generations of mankind.\nVery detailed work with many lines and elements.\nPrimary source - physical art on A2 paper (594x420mm) created with ink liners\noriginal size 5480 x 7736 px\n",
