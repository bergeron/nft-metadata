    "description": "The Omega Point is a theoretical point in the future when the universe has evolved to a limit of maximum organised complexity and then begins to contract upon itself. The title was taken from a 1988 book of the same name by John Gribbins.\n\nThis piece was originally produced as a silkscreen print in 1993, in an edition of 10 and part of a series. However, due to issues with the printing process, none were deemed saleable. The piece has been reconstructed digitally for this release and forms part of my 'Computer Space' series.",
