Ines’s dream has always been to develop her own digital makeup palette that anyone could use as easily as physical makeup, using their fingers. Thanks to developer Sava, she could finally achieve this dream of her, giving people a new tool to create their own digital beauty looks! \nThere will for sure be more 3D makeup palettes soon ✨\n\nThis piece has been developed to be featured for the first time at a physical 3D NFT art exhibition in Sydney called *Satellite* planned for March - April 2022.\n\n\n[αƖρнα Ɓєαυту Ɓσσтн snapchat lens](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=d7f096512d5e469ba02751231adf8b66&metadata=01)\n[Sava twitter](https://twitter.com/SavaForNow)\n",
