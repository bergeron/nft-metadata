    "description": "TechnoBEAST team is building a party bus converted from a school bus. The utility of the BEAST will be used for IRL events and mobile marketing. To bring our concept bus to life, we released a 3D NFT collection to crowd fund the build cost. Inside the bus will be a club vibe with DJ booth, recording studio and gaming lounge. Above we will have a stage for live performances! Our plan is take the BEAST on the road to events around the country and stream them into the Metaverse. Our goal is to onboard new friends into Web3 with the power of music. We believe all communities can benefit from the TechnoBEAST utility and we want to involve everyone! Mint an NFT to feed the BEAST! The build will be streamed on our YouTube and Tik tok channels. Thank you for your time.\nPERKS include:\n- Free entry to all TechnoBEAST events and all other events by the developer team. \n- Mint 10 or more, to get a custom sponsor decal on the bus! \n- 3D printed electronic model toy of TechnoBEAST.\n",
