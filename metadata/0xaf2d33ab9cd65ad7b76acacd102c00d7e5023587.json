    "description": "Greenhouse is a self-portrait that speaks poetically about the personal space, that vital space for people, of the intimacy of the self and the protection of it.\nAs social beings, we need to protect our space, like the greenhouse does with its plants, protecting them from the cold winter. \n\nThe act of defining, delimiting, and protecting our personal space is a key to important survival, it's an exercise in self-knowledge where we must understand that we all have limits, lines that no one should cross because that is where contains our balance and our identity.
