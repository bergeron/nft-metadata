    "description": "Puppy Play is a sprawling community where participants take on the simple headspace of a K9 to escape the unrelenting gears of everyday turmoil. A hyperactive zen that aids in the switching off of higher brain function to explore the subconscious mind and its primal instincts. Puppy Play offers an escape from anxiety and a deep dive into bliss. \n\nSometimes, packs are formed. Chosen family with a self appointed hierarchy consisting of an Alpha, Beta(s), and an Omega.\n\nThis project began in 2016 as a vehicle for self exploration and evolved into an ongoing artistic journey. I explore the many facets of this unique community through portrait sittings and the documentation of community events. \n\nThis photograph is a collaboration between Zak Krevitt and Thomas McCarty, made in 2016 in Rochester, NY.",
