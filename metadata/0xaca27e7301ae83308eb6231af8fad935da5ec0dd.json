This NFT photograph is minted on the 27th February 2022, in support of the Ukrainian people's struggle. 100% of the proceeds from the primary sale of these editions will go towards relief efforts in Ukraine. All royalties from secondary sales will either go towards those same efforts or towards other causes that the For Good Fund is actively supporting at the time.\n\nPhotograph by [sukrits_25](https://opensea.io/sukrits_25)",
