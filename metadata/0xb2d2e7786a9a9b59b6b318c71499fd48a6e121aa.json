    "description": "UNSEEN is a collection dedicated to the pine and oak woodlands of Madrid.\n\nThis small mountain range has served as the recreational area for Spanish Royalty.\nIt has also witnessed many historical events, such as a triumphal battle by Napoleon, and in the same steep hills, the horrid combat depicted in Hemingway ´s novel “For Whom The Bell Tolls” during the Spanish Civil war.\n\nA small glimpse at any given site, and a bit of imagination, can take you back centuries in time.",
