    "description": "1994. Crystal Springs Summer School. A room full of Mac Quadra  and 8100 towers, Syquest and Jazz drives, and a young Dave eager to learn Strata and Bryce. Monday through Thursday I would draw and render. Friday was Marathon day. By the end of the summer I had a collection of spaceships and long, elaborate stories about the battles they fought in and the people who operated them. My favorite summer. ",
