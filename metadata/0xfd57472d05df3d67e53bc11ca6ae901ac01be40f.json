    "description": "“Two Worlds Apart”  \nCan anybody find me?  \nI’m still where I used to be  \nIt seems like no one’s looking  \nBut I feel that I’ll be free\n\nI know that I’m not like them  \nAnd they know they’re not like me \nBut I’d like to keep it that way  \nAnd I feel no jealousy\n\nThose that used to be our shields  \nHave now picked up their swords  \nAnd when we used to walk away  \nThere is no way but towards\n\nPoem by Luca Ponsato",
