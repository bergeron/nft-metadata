    "description": "\nWe, as human beings, consist of three main elements, which are the soul, mind and body. All parts need to be in harmony with each other for an optimum life experience. Living in this state of being is our point of power, our True Self, and our Creationship with our world. \n\nWhen harmony is maintained, one can not be swayed by negative forces that are weaved into the fabric of everyday life ( pendulums). A pendulum is an energy force which uses people’s emotions like fear, anxiety, resentment, admiration, delight, regret, etc. to divert one’s happiness. If you are able to remain steady in your alignment, you can create a reality that feels like an ongoing celebration and even sway the pendulum in your favor.\n \nMy world is taking care of me. When you make the pendulum your bitch! Tame the beast. \n",
