    "description": "Royalty / Loyalty / Humanity \n\nNo Royalty without Loyalty and No Loyalty without Humanity. All come together to build a great City and a strong Kingdom. \nWhat makes the king a king isn’t only the divine power from above but also the acceptance of his people which comprises of the love, peace, unity, and support shown to him and that speaks perfectly about Loyalty and without Humans who will be loyal which best explains Humanity. A king can’t serve himself, a king can’t worship himself and a king can’t adore himself. To make a great kingdom it’s about the three “Royalty- King, Loyalty- Commitment/Support/Corporation/Obedience, Humanity- Service and Love to the Kingdom.",
