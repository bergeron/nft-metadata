    "description": "Brighton Old Pier, also known as the West Pier, is a historic structure in Brighton, England. The pier was built in 1866 and featured four cast iron beams that supported the decking and various attractions. Despite efforts to maintain and restore the pier, it suffered significant damage over time and only the four beams remain standing today. They are a popular sight for visitors and a reminder of the pier's former grandeur. The Brighton Old Pier is an important part of the town's cultural heritage and efforts are being made to preserve it for future generations.",
