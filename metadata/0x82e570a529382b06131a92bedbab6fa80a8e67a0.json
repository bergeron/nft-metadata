    "description": "I have lived in the Czech Republic for three years. I come from the Lviv region, Ukraine. So far, the war is avoiding it. I have two children, an adult daughter and a son. The son now had to go to war, he was deployed on the border with Poland. He hasn't reached the front line yet. I would love to get my daughter here too. I would not want to return to Ukraine. She has a small baby, so I'm a grandmother and I want to keep them all safe here.",
