STAPLEVERSE NrG x Rizzoli celebrates the first ever physical book published by STAPLE's founder Jeff Staple. According to the New York Times, \"Since 1964, Rizzoli has long published some of the most beautifully illustrated books in the world.\"\n\nOnly twenty-five (25) STAPLEVERSE x Rizzoli NFTs will ever exist. Holders of the NFT are eligible to receive a special edition of the book \"JEFF STAPLE: NOT JUST SNEAKERS\" (Nov 2022). This special physical edition comes housed in a magnetic sealed box which includes accompanying STAPLE x Rizzoli T-Shirt, \"Epilogue 01\" Booklet, and special gold stamp denoting this Coinbase NFT collaboration.\n\nEach of the 25 books will be hand-signed and numbered by Jeff Staple himself. When the physical book releases later in 2022, a future snapshot date will be announced. Whomever possesses this NFT at that exact snapshot date and time, will be eligible to receive the physical book for free.",
