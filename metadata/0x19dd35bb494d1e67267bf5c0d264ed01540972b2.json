    "name": "Lady Persephone With Pomegranates",
    "description": "Pomegranates have a long and interesting history, and the fruit has played a role in many religions and belief systems throughout history. \n\nPomegranates have been associated with life, death, rebirth, eternal life, fertility, abundance, and marriage. In fact, in Ancient Greek mythology, it was the pomegranate that explained the change in seasons. \n\nWhen Hades married Persephone and took her to the underworld, he tricked her into eating six pomegranate seeds, which condemned her to spend eternity there. This caused Persephone's mother Demeter, goddess of fertility, to go into mourning, which meant everything on land ceased to grow. But only for six months. \n\nSince she ate six seeds, Persephone was freed from the underworld and allowed to see her mother the other six months of the year. It was those months (spring and summer) when mother and daughter were reunited, and the land was fertile.\n\n",
