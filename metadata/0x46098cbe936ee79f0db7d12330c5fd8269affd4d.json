    "description": "I live in a region where there are many fields and forests. Therefore , nature is a frequent component in my photos . We got up at 4 in the morning to have more time to take pictures before the sun would bake. I also took a mirror with me and this was my main attribute. Here I expressed the frankness of nature and man, which does not turn into vulgarity.",
