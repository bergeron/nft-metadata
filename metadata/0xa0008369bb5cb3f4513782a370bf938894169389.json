    "description": "Unapologetic, Iman Europe raps with effortless flow. Having established her footing, she asserts herself as self-possessed and in control in music and beyond. A seasoned musician and Head of Artist Relations at Sound, she is grounded in her sense of self worth, and is supported by  both the web2 and web3 music communities. \n\nIman’s moment is coming. She knows she’s really lit. It’s just time the rest of the world knows it, too. \n  \nHere’s how Iman describes her latest track, “REALLY LIT!”:\n\n“I always make songs that are very intentional. I'm spiritual and deep, but I wanted a fun, braggadocious song.”\n\n“REALLY LIT!” was written and performed by Iman Europe, produced by Mikosdagawd, and features background vocals by Fat Ron and Taylor Alford. \n\n----\n\nThis is the sixth track from HIGH FREQUENCY Volume 1—a compilation album curated by NOISE.\n\nRead interviews with each artist at noisedao.mirror.xyz.",
