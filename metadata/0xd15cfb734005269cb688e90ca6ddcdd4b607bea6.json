    "description": "I started Say You’re Mine on a cold “winter” night in LA a few years ago with some friends. We were chatting and hanging around at a session that was supposed to be wrapping up. I remember sitting on the floor near the little studio heater and listening to Adam, an amazing producer and friend, play the guitar loop. It didn’t take long for me to know where I wanted to go with the melody and lyrics. I had been writing a lot of angsty songs around that time and wanted to change the messaging, so I REALLY changed it up and started singing about love and rainbows… Check ⎷ \nBut the second I started singing, I thought about my husband. There’s so much that we have been through together and I can feel our connection energetically. As we continued to write I really wanted to hone on the gentle love that is just one part of my intricate and beautiful relationship. A soft side that doesn’t rush, is patient, understanding, and sees the light in my lover. This song I dedicate to Scorch. Who will you dedicate it to to? \n\nSongwriters// Caly Bevier & Kayla Blackmon\nProducer// Adam Kapit ",
