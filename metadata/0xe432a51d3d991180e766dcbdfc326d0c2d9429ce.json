    "description": "An eclectic combination of light painting and top-down drone photography, the Painted Waves series uses the shores and waves of Shek O beach in Hong Kong as a canvas for a completely unique set of artworks. \n \nA single, perfect line shines above a long shutter shot of incoming waves. The light from the drone above the waves creates an ethereal effect, illuminating the incoming waves as they lap on the shore.",
