    "description": "Larkin Street\n\nThere are 1200 bus shelters in San Francisco. The structures are similar- red lighted roofs, aluminum supports and illuminated ad boards, but the fun element is each has a unique background- graffiti, a pizza shop or just darkness. Some bus stops are busy, while others are almost always deserted. Combine these elements with night light and the citizenry of SF and you have some architectural street photo goodness.",
