    "description": "The Crypto Ouroboros 1k collection was a free mint made available by the crypto-artist Collie Pixels. The illustrations are timeless symbols of the immutable cycle of death/rebirth. The serpent contiously eats its tail for eternity. OUROBOROS holders are granted exclusive access to air drops & white lists. Only 1k will ever be minted from the Ouroboros Foundry ERC721 contract. Just the beginning. https://crypto-ouroboros.com/",
