    "description": "Amongst the goddesses, the one who is extolled time and again by many across scriptures is Goddess Maha Saraswati. She represents the creative power of this Universe. Clad in white and holding the Veda in one hand, she represents the purity and delight of knowledge within us. On the other hand, she has Veena, symbolising the creative inspiration that springs forth from the inner self, ever-replenishing. Mother Saraswati is also known as \"Sharada\". In the Hindu epic Mahabharata's chapter \"Shanti Parva\", Saraswati is called Vedamata (the mother of Vedas), and later as the celestial creative symphony that appeared when Brahma created the Universe. \n\n** Non-Animated High-resolution version is available for collectors; contact the artist via DM. \n** Music/Vocals by Samarth Saxena, recorded in studios with pro musicians, exclusive to the Rebel Club's Diwali Collab, with 15+ artists. \n\nLicences\n* Artwork: CC-BY-NC-SA\n* Audio: CC-BY-NC-SA",
