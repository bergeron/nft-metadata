    "description": "8000 x 3810\nDigital Video \n\n“Love Puddles” captures the feeling of melancholia when love dies. It illustrates two responses, acceptance and resistance. \n\nThe scene takes place after a storm, representing the aftermath of intense sorrow. This quiet scene is tragic because the underground worms have crawled to the surface to escape drowning in the rainwater the soil has soaked up. \n\nThe worm-like candles represent the brevity of human relationships. When a relationship ends, there are two ways in which we react. One is to hold on to passion shown through the lit candles. The other response is to accept the end of a relationship and let it rest, illustrated through the extinguished flames.",
