    "description": "‘Momentum’ is the first piece from the series ‘Everlasting’, a collection of digital artworks that bring new life into abandoned buildings by combining photography with animation to create surreal, meditative, moving architectural spaces. \n\nOver a period of several years, artists Ryan Koopmans and Alice Wexell travelled around the world exploring and photographing forsaken buildings and unique architectural sites. They were drawn to these locations based on the particular historical, cultural and architectural qualities of the place. \n\nFrom ancient temples in the mountains of Armenia, to elaborate abandoned theatres in the Middle East, the artists trekked to remote corners of the planet under strenuous conditions in order to find remarkable and unseen locations where their creativity could be applied. \n\nOnce the architecture has been photographed, the images are then modelled into virtual environments and overgrown plant-life is introduced digitally. The lighting and structure is modified, a custom musical composition is added, and the photograph is transformed into a moving image that loops seamlessly. The piece ‘Momentum’ features an original score by composer Adam Benyahai. \n\nThe artist’s intentions are to revive these vacant spaces, essentially bringing life back into the buildings. They aim to transport the viewer into an alternate place and time, creating a surreal collision between the past and future as well as the merging of physical and digital worlds. \n\nConceptually, the theme of preservation is compounded by the fact that some of the buildings depicted in the artworks have been demolished or continue to deteriorate, further emphasizing the theme of time passing in the cycle of growth and decay. \n\nThe fusing of documentary-style photography with the imaginative potential of animation techniques results in a body of work that is captivating and meditative.
