    "description": "\"Fatal Invocation\" - art 1/1 by Yevhen Stepanov, 2022 year. \nDimensions 6028 x 8000 JPG.\n\nA cannibal sorcerer decided to summon and enlist the support of a powerful being from a magical dimension. He disregarded one of the basic rules of a summoner - don't summon someone you can't defend against. The payback was immediate, because in the world of witchcraft, the strong will not negotiate with those who are weaker, they will simply take everything from him.\nThe sorcerer was not helped by his protective attributes, they were broken, and his life and magical powers were absorbed by the powerful sorcery of the dark elfess.",
