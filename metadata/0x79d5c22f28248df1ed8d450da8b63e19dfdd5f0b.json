    "description": "The mountains are a place where I have always been able to escape from all the stresses and strains of everyday life. It is like going through the wardrobe into Narnia, crossing into a magical otherworldly place. A place that has wonders, risks and challenges. A place that has the potential to overcome, to achieve, to conquer, to reflect and to grow.",
