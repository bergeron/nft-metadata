    "description": "Origin is the cornerstone of a series of works that will be developed on a digital platform, within the poetics of artist André Mendes. This series invites us to enter a frequency that dissipates the most elementary notions of space and time, metaphysical and material, real and imaginary. By reaffirming his poetic research, interested in creating fictional environments, the artist leads the public to parallel realities of architectures devoid of temporalities and perceptible limits.\n\nVídeo MP4\n1920x1920\n12s",
