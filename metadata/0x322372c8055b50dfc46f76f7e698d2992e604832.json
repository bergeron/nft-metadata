    "description": "Tamuna Sirbiladze painted her tiles quickly, like she did with many of her paintings. Her eyes were fast, when it came to the decision, if another layer would augment the aesthetic value. It was not an algorithm, but a certainty in the judgement, knowing that it was about nothing. Birds, plants, cats, frogs, caves, shores, stages, everything can enter into this realm of the abstract, achieved by the careless moves of a free spirit.",
