    "description": "2021 was marked by major events in the crypto space.   The art market saw a radical shift of mentality, with a rise of new generation NFTs, valuing digital art and the power of the blockchain to address market gaps and needs. A true digital art revolution with platforms disrupting the way we sell and acquire art, empowering artists to explore new ways of disrupting the industry.  \n\nNew financial products in major DEXs enabled the growth of market caps and allowed new alt coins to provide new services, along with the emergance of new protocols. At the same time the end sight of the Covid pandemic allowed wealth to be injected into the economy while fortunes shifted from traditional assets to digital capital, fueling new regulations in the crypto space. This sent a clear message that the digital revolution is on its way, enabling a bull year that saw astonishing new ATHs.\n\n2021 was a Bull year that will be remembered, ending a crypto winter after the ICO craze of 2017.",
