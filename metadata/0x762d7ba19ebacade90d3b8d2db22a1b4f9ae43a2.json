    "description": "I was prompted to create this work by thinking about space, our connection with it and with the whole world around us. All the objects of the universe are as if pulled together by a thin invisible thread, when broken, the balance will be disturbed and chaos will ensue. Space is a huge space, hardly comprehensible for the human brain, most of it has not been explored at all, it is full of secrets and mysteries. The processes taking place in it directly affect our planet and us, this is a huge system in which we are a small gear. Each of us has a piece of space, we are space",
