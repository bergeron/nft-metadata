    "description": "1/1 Edition\n\nThis angle captures the two sides of Niagara Falls, the Canadian and the US side in one single shot, with the rushing water of the Falls acting as the border between them.\n\nBoth countries have built cities called Niagara Falls on each side of the waterfall. The two cities face each other and have their own unique, opposing perspectives of the Falls.\n\nVisitors from each side can be seen taking in the views, almost as if they're living in two parallel worlds, existing simultaneously, separated by the mist and thundering sound of the Falls.",
