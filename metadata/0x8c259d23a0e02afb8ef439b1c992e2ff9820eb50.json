    "description": "Ask any person what they think gives someone POWER and they will all answer differently. Some might choose money, believing that the more you can consume, the more you can control. Others might insist on influence being king. But commanding through loyalty ensures you have people willing to die for your cause, and less knives in the back from the highest bidder. What if you could have both ? What if an entity existed who wielded money, influence and loyalty in tandem so that no person, no organisation could ever hope to match their power? That privilege belongs solely to The Family, and to the ZooVerse empire they rule.",
