    "description": "The majority of technologies in the 3x9 universe were not created by humans. Everything from computer circuitry to synthetic materials is part of the environment. Nature is a cybernetic system in which not only plastics and electronics grow by themselves but also our ancestors' beliefs become reality: the forest has a mind, it is full of real \"ghosts\", and mythological cyber plants can provide enormous power, improve implant functionality, or even be implanted under skin.\n\nIn this scene, we see an orchard that has been ruined by flooding. And apples are a symbol of a system error.",
