    "description": "The first work of the \"Another Universe\" collection was inspired by my childhood drawing.\n\nOur universe is not the only one. There are others. And it is likely that one of the universes looks like this. There are a lot of amazing creatures in this universe, and they are friendly to each other (or not). They’re so different but they unite by the general supervision. Who is it? It’s a big secret.",
