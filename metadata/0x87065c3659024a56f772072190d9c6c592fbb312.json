    "description": "Genesis mint from my Bodyglyph series. In 2014, after a long hiatus from photography, I decided to reclaim how my body-art was being captured by other photographers with whom I was working since 2009. This series is about holding space, and creating the conditions for natural moments of embodied grace and connection to emerge from the model. We hike into nature, find a pristine spot, drop in to the meditative glyphing of the body, and then let the shoot unfold organically. My favorite moments are when there is a synthesis between my subject and her environment, and the dance that unfolds when her consciousness shifts and returns to a timeless state of connection with nature. This series is about honoring and elevating all things feminine and divine. I love to shoot B&W (it runs in the family), and incorporate photography into my art-practice in many ways. While I like to experiment and push processes, I also like capturing the simplicity of forms and patterns.",
