    "description": "We all know that the best photos are unplanned.\n\nEvery time I leave my office or a formal meeting, I take off my bra at the first opportunity.\n\nThe photo was taken by accident, when a person helping me with my photo shoots, just for fun took a picture of how after a meeting, right on the run, I was taking off that hated bra. \n\nP.S. IRL I smoke just a few cigarettes a year, and that day turned out to be very nervous.",
