    "description": "The architecture in London really draws my eye and lookup shots always show it off. I was wandering along south of the river near Tower Bridge and came across these triangular buildings. At first, I didnâ€™t look up and was shooting along the buildings. But when I did, it opened a whole new opportunity. The symmetry was perfect, blue bursting through whispers of cloud, creating my favourite lookup shot.\n\nTitle: Skylight\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nCollection: Journeys Through London\n\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
