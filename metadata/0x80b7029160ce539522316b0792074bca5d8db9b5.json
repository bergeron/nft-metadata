    "description": "A mysterious immortal who has no idea whence he came is floating alone in space on an asteroid, surrounded only by local magic mushrooms. He doesn't know if anyone else other than him even exists, nor does he understand why or how he came to be. He didn't even realize that the plants he was passing through held the answers to all of his questions. After floating aimlessly through space for ages, he witnessed a comet colliding with a nearby planet, and the idea struck him to visit the impact site.",
