    "description": "The most powerful insignia rune is Aegishjalmur, the “Helm of Awe”, a symbol of invincibility that takes power away from one’s enemies on both a material and spiritual level. It is made up of eight Algiz runes, and is supplemented by dashes, each of which represents one of the remaining 24 runes. Thus, this symbol contains the power of all the runes directed out from the centre of the insignia.",
