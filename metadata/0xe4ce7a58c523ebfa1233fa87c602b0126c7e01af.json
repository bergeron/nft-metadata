    "description": "GUCCI commissioned me to create a series of images for celebrating their 100th anniversary and for the launch of their first collectible collaboration with Hot Wheels. For creating the series of images, I crafted a miniature diorama of Gucci's first shop in Florence, inside a wooden box that stands as a \"travel in time suitcase”. This is an extremely rare 'non-official' suitcase that was created for a commissioned project by Gucci with their authorization. This Gucci x Hot Wheels collaboration was a real joy to create and one of my most beloved projects so far… for what these brands represent in the design world. Artwork includes wooden and engraved suitcase, miniature art diorama inside the suitcase with working lights, limited edition 1/1 Fine Art Print (stored inside the suitcase / Size: 39 x 26.5 cm / Printed in Museum Quality Acid Free Cotton Paper), Certificate of Authenticity Hand Signed, Limited Edition Gucci - Hot Wheels Cadillac Seville / Extremely Rare / Prototype. Material: Solid Wood. Dimensions: 36cm tall, 54.5cm wide, 20.5cm width",
