    "description": "A very special mint. Blue sky on top and sunflowers on the bottom, just like beautiful Ukraine. \n\nIn this image a dark figure looms in front of the sun, trying to block it, but there's still a glimmer of light breaking through. We must remain hopeful but conscious, and we must not stand still. \n\n100% of profits to Ukraine support, auction starting at 0.75 ETH, hoping it will go as high as possible.\n\nQuite coincidentally, this image was shot near my birthplace, in the south of Portugal, also known for it's beautiful sunflower fields. It is virtually impossible for me to imagine my birthplace being destroyed, so I cannot fathom what Ukrainians must be feeling right now... \n\n100% of profits of this sale will be directly donated to a crypto account to support Ukraine, decided through the collector and artist's agreement (official Ukraine government ETH support account, DAO or other). Donation  can be publicly confirmed through etherscan, whose register will be posted on Twitter.\n\nThanks!",
