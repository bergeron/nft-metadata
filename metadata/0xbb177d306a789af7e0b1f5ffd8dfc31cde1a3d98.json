    "description": "The Showtime movement represents a group of athletes who have etched their names in history by taking on the web3 world, but the brand goes deeper than an NFT. Showtime is a multimedia platform that highlights athletes in a way that is an accurate representation of themselves. Showtime allows athletes to express themselves through our stories, interviews, and blog posts. Our goal is to create a decentralized environment for athletes to connect directly with their fans and peers. Showtime represents a family of trailblazers ready to push innovation and change the status quo.",
