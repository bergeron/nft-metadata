    "name": "Zeera, the Tamer of Lions",
    "description": "Zeera the nominated legend of the Oshu Tribe, is one of the strongest warrior of planet Etherea. A warrior that was casted out by the tribe for betraying and joining the Dead King’s Army as a King's Guard. Her tales of heroics brought her fame and a legendary status in the mind of the King’s Army. Her fame became a source of concern for the dead King as he feared Zeera might turn on him and try to take over the throne. The Dead King convinced the United Council of Metaworlds that Zeera could be a threat to their government and sentenced her to the final death. She was stripped of her command, and her head and limbs were chopped off. The Dead King was successful in disabling the body of Zeera but was unsuccessful in burning the conscious of Zeera from the block chain. The Tribe of Oshu brought the fallen warrior back to life and nominated her their Legend to fight the Dead King and redeem herself.  \nWith the metal head and metal limbs, the road to redemption begins for Zeera!",
