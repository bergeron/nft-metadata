    "description": "The year is 2050. Humans are an interplanetary species and have all but abandoned the post-apocalyptic shatters of society on earth. Cats have taken over. One crime-ridden, nondescript inner city is inhabited by a group of cats collectively known as the Gutter Cats. With a bird’s-eye view of the Autonomous Zone, the Gutter Pigeons keep their claws on the pulse of the power dynamics below. Purveyors of misinformation and peddlers of mistrust, the Pigeons, known as the “Rats of the Sky” in the Gutter, have created an intricate smuggling network to transport contraband, news, and rumors into the streets.",
