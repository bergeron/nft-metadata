    "description": "Satoshi is female is a subculture movement bringing women, people of color into NFTs, so we can architect and flourish in the new digital economy. \n\nWe started as a small group of crypto-activists seeding the idea that the architect of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, could be anyone, could be anywhere, and could be female.   \n\nThis is the first-ever, 1-of-1 Satoshi is Female NFT, launched in partnership with emerging Miami-based artist, Tierra Armstrong. \n\nFrom the artist: I wanted the subject to have a very poised demeanor in this piece as I was going through quite a large change as we all were during the time the pandemic struck. I felt an array of emotions while having the space to really process them, leading me down a path of self discovery and confidence in self something I always saw in Lydia (the muse). The rural aesthetic in this piece stems from my time spending quarantine in PR with my mother. I found it to be such a beautiful experience. I had nothing but time to go through rural lands and explore the outdoors as well as myself. I felt it was necessary to include some of the beautiful plants I would see while in the forest. "
