    "description": "*Life* is sweet, yet bittersweet, overflowing with abundance, yet bordering on overstimulation. She represents the culmination of today's outpouring of content and culture, resulting in a sickly saccharine mix of various eye-catching features.

However, upon further inspection, those features seem to melt into nothing.",
