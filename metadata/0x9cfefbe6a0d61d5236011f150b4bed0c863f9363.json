    "description": "Morning grind is a photo captured of a person walking off to some place. That could be work,home or even just a place to unwind and relax before the day starts. \n\nEarly Mornings are quiet and everyone is still slow to get out of bed. But every now and then you will catch a person or two who are up early and on the move to what is either their job or possibly an errand that needs to be done before things get busy! ",
