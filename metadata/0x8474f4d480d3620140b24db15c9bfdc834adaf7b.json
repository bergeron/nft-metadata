    "description": "The Revolution Spirit - Acrylic on canvas by Crystel Samia\n\nI create this painting on an the evening of the Independence day in Lebanon. Simultaneously, a revolution was rising in Lebanon, and I was participating in many peaceful protests during that time, where everyone came together, filling the streets of Beirut and asking for our basic rights. While painting I was thinking about the concept of revolution, and how important it is in bringing change and evolution. But I discovered that there are two types of revolutions: the one that comes as a reaction, and is fueled by anger, and the one that comes from a conscious thought, fueled by knowledge and wisdom. I hope you choose to be part of the later, and I hope this painting will be your reminder for positive change and growth!\n\n✨ From my UNIVERSE to your SPACE! ✨ ",
