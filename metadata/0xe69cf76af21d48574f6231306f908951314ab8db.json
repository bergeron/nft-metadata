    "description": "The Puget Sound region is famous for its breathtaking views and sunset hues. The colors and shades in this piece reflect those that the landscape takes on during the golden hour and beyond into the night hours. Despite the technological nature of the Web3 industry, I always like to remind myself that at the end of the day we still live in a organic world, with interpretations such as this. \n\nThe Perfectionist does not not believe in obtaining a perfect state of life but instead practices unwavering perseverance in obtaining the best possible state of life. \n\nSo make 2023 the best you possibly can. \nBe Perfect.\n\nThis is an FREE OPEN EDITION, with up to 5 editions available per claim. There is no implication of utility associated with this piece aside from the Art itself. I hope you enjoy this in your collection, and thank you for you support.  \n\n*Genesis Mint on my ERC1155 Manifold contract.* \n\nCreated & Minted by: Bodhizai, 2023.  \n5000 x 4267 px - 300dpi - Ai/Photoshop/Topaz  \nTwitter: @Bodhizai  \nIG: @Bodhizai  \nwww.bodhizai.com\n\nCollectors have personal printing and other rights entitled under Creative Commons.",
