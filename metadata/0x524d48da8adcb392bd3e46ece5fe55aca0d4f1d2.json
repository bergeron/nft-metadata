    "description": "To express feelings and communicate through a medium of colour and texture has been an important tool for me. Putting paint on surfaces gives me the time to think and deconstruct my reactions to certain events. Colour has always been a part of my process and creating textures and depth through the layering of colour, allows the observer to witness the stages. Light, colour and shadow are present in my work as metaphors for life, love and loss.",
