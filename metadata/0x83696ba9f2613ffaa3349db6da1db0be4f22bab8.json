    "description": "The cranes are delicately placed on Goryeo celadon. Set against the green jade color of the glaze, they appear to be floating carefree.\n\nArtwork Details\nTitle: Plum bottle decorated with cranes \nPeriod: Goryeo dynasty\nDate: late 13th century\nCulture: Korea\n\nMy Mom immigrated to the United States when she was four years old. I was born there and moved several times before moving to Korea without much knowledge of the history and culture. Mom and I now frequent museums on weekends in search of hidden treasures. We are aiming to learn and appreciate the rich history of this country and maybe even better understand ourselves. The Saturday we learned about the Goryeo Dynasty will forever be remembered because of the stunning ceramics that survived the hundreds of years of modernization. They are classic and beautifully timeless. ",
