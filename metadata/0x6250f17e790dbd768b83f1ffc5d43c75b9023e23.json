    "description": "Christian was walking along the streets of the City of Vancouver during a dark and rainy night. He suddenly had an inspiration when he saw one of the buildings on his way back home. He created the first image with the City Skyline from Vancouver and was inspired by the German expressionist science-fiction drama film \"Metropolis\" directed by Fritz Lang in 1927 during the creative process. \n\nChristian named his Fine Art project \"Vantropolis\" and shows his future vision of Vancouver in a few hundred years. Vantropolis is in Christian's mind a safe, clean, and peaceful place on our blue planet. Enjoy Christian's version of Vancouver - \"Vantropolis\"",
