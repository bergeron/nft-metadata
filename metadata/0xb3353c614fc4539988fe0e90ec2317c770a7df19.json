    "description": "After travelling as far east as the sea reaches, my liege, you may come to the forest home of the priestess cult - Piccolo Fiore.\n\nStrange powers gather in the trees at every solstice.\n\nMarkets are held to honour the visitors that come, roaring fires are erected all around the Evertrees, animals are turned on heavy spits and at each word that the traveller says – ‘liquor’, ‘hunger’, ‘lover’, ‘blood’, ‘heat’, ‘fight’, ‘ecstasy’, ‘disease’ – the sisters gift a tale of liquor, hunger, lover, blood, heat, fight, ecstasy, disease.\n\nAnd the traveller looks forward to the long journeys ahead, to the times when he will struggle to stay awake against the sea’s gentle rocking or the swaying of a dusty dry camel.\n\nThen, he will summon the sister's gifts one by one - his liquor will become other liquors, his lover other lovers, his ecstasy other ecstasies. \n\nMemory is traded under every solstice moon in Piccolo Fiore.\n\nDigital collage with PS, AI and generative processes.",
