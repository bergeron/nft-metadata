    "description": "\"Night Call\" was created during my work on the Cyberpunk 2077 project where I was one of the developers. \n\nAt some point in my work, I started photographing the city on my way home. The process was therapeutic for me after hours spent at exhausting tasks I could think and do something else. During this time, strongly inspired by the art direction of the game I was unraveling Cyberpunk in  Warsaw. \n\nThis particular shot Was taken in the Warsaw city center. It was a rainy night and most of the people left the offices hours ago.  I have spotted one guy having a call and decided to use that as a good base for photographs. It reminds me of all these late-night calls that I had. \n\n1/1 Unique Piece\nCreated by Pawel Wilkos",
