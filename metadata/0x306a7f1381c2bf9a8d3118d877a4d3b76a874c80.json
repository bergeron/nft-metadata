    "description": "In 2019 we wanted to create a toy, and we wanted it to be a character that would evoke the feeling of classic video game characters. Of course amongst our main references are late 80’s & early 90’s characters like Mario, Sonic, Megaman, and Son Goku.\n\nWe kept iterating on the design in 3D, trying for a basic static shiny art toy look, to something more sofubi-like, and eventually settling on a plastic model-kit look.\n\nKidbash idolizes classic videogame heroes, and so his goal is to become one himself! Though he does not remember where he comes from, this doesn’t stop him from trying to force his own hero’s journey.",
