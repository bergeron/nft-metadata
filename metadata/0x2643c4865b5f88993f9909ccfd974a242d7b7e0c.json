    "description": "The phrase \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" is a line from the 1975 film Jaws, spoken by the character Chief Brody when he first sees the size of the shark they are hunting. It became a catchphrase for anytime anything went wrong.\n\nIt could be used as a metaphor for any situation where one is confronted with something much larger and more powerful than oneself. Overall, the phrase \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" has the power to convey a sense of awe and humility, and can be used to reflect on the relationship between humanity and the natural world.",
