    "description": "A borrowed phrase from William Gibson’s “Neuromancer”, Consensual Hallucinations is Victor Reyes Studio’s genesis collection on SuperRare. \n\nWas it all a dream? Were the images brought across the threshold of reality onto the blockchain a mass psychosis of markets? Can there even be such a thing as a digital diaspora? \n\nReyes believes we’re entering a new epoch of art. One that blurs the lines between Human and Machine. In this uncanny valley, the hallucinations will be come real. \n\nConsensual Hallucinations is a dedication to the Crypto Art movement as a whole: a pioneering style of art that re-shaped the ability for creative people to explore, engage, and deliver their works. Where the naive see monkey pictures, Reyes saw a new art form emerge around decentralization and finance. Here, the medium is the code and the possibilities are limitless. ",
