    "description": " When the spring day has come, it's time for nature to be painted in many colors by flowers! \n\n  Speaking of spring, cherry blossom(known as sakura) flowers are the most well-known spring flowers in Japan. Everywhere you go is covered with light pink petals dancing in the wind. The weather is slightly getting warmer, people are also happy to go out and do activities.\n\n  One of my favorite sakura viewing spots in Japan is at Shukugawara station ( 宿河原駅 ) located in Kawasaki, Kanagawa prefecture, which is not far from my apartment. There are lots of sakura trees along the two sides of the canal, where the ducks and birds are swimming happily. Even though it's not a tourist spot, it is such a nice place to see the flowers with a peaceful atmosphere.",
