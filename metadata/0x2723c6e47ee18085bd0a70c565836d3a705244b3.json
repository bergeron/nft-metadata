    "description": "DADAGAN is an experimental collaboration by DADA and artist and roboticist Alexander Reben. It explores the relationship between AI art and human artists, as well as the possibilities and limits of automation of DADAGAN as A.I. artist. This collection of portraits by DADAGAN was generated in 2019. Reben trained a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to draw using a data set of 115,000 drawings made by people on DADA. DADAGANâ€™s work was featured at the Tate Modern, Superrare, and CADAF Miami, all in 2019. DADAGAN continues participating daily in DADA's visual conversations where DADA artists respond to its drawings. nft.dada.art/dadagan",
