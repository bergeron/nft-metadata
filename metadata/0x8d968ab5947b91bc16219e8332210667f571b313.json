    "name": "Officer's Sword of President Chiang, 1949 #1",
    "description": "The sword the NFT represents was given to President Chiang Kai-shek by the overseas Chinese in San Francisco in the 38th year of the Republic of China. Four big characters were engraved on the top of it to read \"Counter-insurgency, Nation-building.\" When Chiang Kai-shek himself came to Taiwan, he wore it for a period of time, and it is now well preserved in the Kuomintang. The plum blossom relief on the sword symbolizes national supremacy. The relief of carp dragon scales on it symbolizes the spirit of moving forward against the current. This time, let the sword use the NFT appearance and return to the United States to connect the overseas Chinese community and show the world that this historical significance is extraordinary. ",
