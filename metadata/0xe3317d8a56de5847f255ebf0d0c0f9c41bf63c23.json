    "description": "With the development of high technology, human beings will soon enter the era of Super-intelligence, where the boundaries between human and animal, human and machine, human and nature, material and immaterial are gradually blurred, and the post-human breaks down all kinds of anthropocentric binaries and provides us with a new way of thinking. \n\nIn this project, I constructed the post-human figure from a feminist perspective. I want to question the expression of female eroticism in a world dominated by male narratives and discuss the ways in which female desire can be expressed in the present and the future. I imagined a future tribe where my questions are housed, a tribe where the cyborg pole dancer is dancing with full force, and her razor-sharp mechanical prosthetics are smashing everything. The Sphynx Babe is the first cyborg I created in this Post-Human Angel project.",
