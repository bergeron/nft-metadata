    "description": "Strength is a Major Arcana tarot card, and is numbered either XI or VIII, depending on the deck.\nThe key characters are that of a woman and a lion, with the woman leaning over the lion. Many cards, including that of the Rider–Waite–Smith deck, have the woman clasping the lion's jaws. Some feature an Infinity symbol hovering over the woman's head. Other decks have the woman sitting upon the lion, or merely with one hand upon it. Some decks feature just one of the characters; flowers are often presented on this card.\nOur interpretation of the Strength shows the lion and the woman becoming one thing, to symbolize the willpower of women and not showing violence against this beautiful animal.\n\nEthereal Journey Tarot is a collaborative deck where each card is individually designed by a different international artist.\n\nIllustration by Chiara Morra\nAnimation by Matteo Goi\n\n1500x2686 px\nTools: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects",
