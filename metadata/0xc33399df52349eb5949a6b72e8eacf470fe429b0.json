    "description": "The purpose of this illustration is to show the beauty of the Chui Valley and the capital of our republic, Bishkek. The central element of the image is the tunduk, as a symbolic, unifying element, connecting heaven and earth referencing the crown and the ground of the Yurt. The nomadic dwelling of the Kyrgyz Hills and mountains of Kungey Ala-too, Chui, and Chon-Kemin valleys are illustrated in a circle in the style of traditional ornaments. Rich fertile fields where oats, wheat, corn, and sugar beets are also shown further, along with the Chu River. \r\n\r\nThe railroad tracks of Bishkek are still in use today, connecting the capital of Bishkek with regions in and out of Kyrgyzstan. I also wanted to accentuate the Post-Soviet, architectural heritage in Bishkek: Ala-too square, a monument to Urkuya Saliyeva, registry office, Philharmonic, Chapel, Opera, and Ballet Theater.",
