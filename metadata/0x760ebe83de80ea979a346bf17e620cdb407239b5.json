    "description": "Always rep where you're from. \n\nCollection 02 from THE MINTAREA PROJECT continues the story of Hologram Kizzie and Bionik's triumphant journey through a new and promising land called Mintarea. \n\nOur main characters are hip hop musicians originally from Villcha - they'll never forget where they came from. \n\n\"Villchan Graffiti\" is the next song in a tale of two artists following their path against all odds, celebrating all the colorful beings they meet along the way. If you've been following since the previous collection, you'll hear a special shoutout to our first collector / superconnection :) \n\nPlease enjoy, and consider joining us in Mintarea ðŸŒ‹",
