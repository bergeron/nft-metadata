    "description": "This will be my first Edition and also the first of my composite work to be minted and sold. This image is a composite of several photos, I wanted my composite work to be based on new images and not simply composite things from my archive. All of the images in this composite were taken in March and April of 2022. This working method is something that I will continue to explore as it allows me to plan ahead and produce something more conceptual than pure street photography. \n\nEdition of 30. \n\n\nImage rights remain with the creator but collectors on primary or secondary are permitted to make prints for personal use.",
