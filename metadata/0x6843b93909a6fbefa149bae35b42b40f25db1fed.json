    "description": "The smoky fanzine came to life in 2012 and became a cult with the collages he made and the articles he wrote, staying out of the system. It has never been sold for decentralized currencies and is now for sale in a decentralized area on Opensea. We can fight together underground as support. The photos used in the fanzine will be converted to nft.",
