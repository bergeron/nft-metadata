    "description": "'Introspection is the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotions. In psychology, the process of introspection relies on the observation of one's mental state, while in a spiritual context it may refer to the examination of one's soul. Introspection is closely related to human self-reflection and self-discovery and is contrasted with external observation.' \nThis series of works is a visual representation of some of these states of mind and self-discoveries using photographs shot at times of deep reflection.",
