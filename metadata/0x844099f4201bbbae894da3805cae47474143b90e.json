    "description": "#1 of 8 limited NFTs.\n\nThis NFT represents the Original Canvas Painting from the \"Form\" series I did in 2014. They were first exhibited in the Gallery Diamant, Paris, France. \n\n120x90 cm (47x35 inch)\nOil on canvas\n2014, Paris\n\nThe concept of form is an appeal to the “form” of Aristotle.\n\nWe are only a “form”.\n\nThis art project is about the transience of life and the fragility of the human body.\n\nVisual range is the rank of plaster heads (painting) each of which is encrusted with bloody rubies (they are also arranged in a lines).\n\nBlood-born. It is our code and memory.\n\nPrecious stones as the most durable material and symbolizes the soul. The fragile plaster symbolizes flesh ( human body).\n\nAny plaster sculpture will be broken, the gems will remain forever.\n\nOur bodies are gypsum and souls are diamonds.",
