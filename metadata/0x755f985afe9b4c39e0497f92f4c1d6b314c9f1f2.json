    "description": "The Ocean Spirit, entangled.\n\n‘Nets II’ is a photograph taken by Hasselblad photographer, David Teran. Audrey salvaged these fishing nets, swept onto the shores of Maui, and created this hand-sewn garment. \n\nThis costume will be worn by the Ocean Spirit who dances for her freedom in ‘Oceans Apart’, an experimental film by filmmaker/performer Audrey Billups (pictured).\n\nA portion of proceeds will be donated to Love the Sea, a Maui-based non-profit that removes plastic from remote beaches.\n\nIncludes unlockable content.
