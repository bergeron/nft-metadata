    "description": "Aloha! Welcome to Hawaii!\n\nThis Token  \nThe \"negative\" of the lushness of Waimea Canyon on the island of Kauai, Hawaii, complete with a waterfall, takes on the feeling of an abstract work of art rather than being the \"Grand Canyon\" of the Pacific.\n\nThis Collection  \nOne day, while playing around with various images, I used the “invert” feature of the editing software. There it was, complete beauty in the “negative,” reminding me of my fascination as a child with looking at 35mm negatives and the strange colors they possessed.\n\nI began creating collections based on some of the places I’ve visited, highlighting that both the “negative” and “positive” views can share great beauty.\n\nWhether you prefer the mysteriousness of the \"negative,\" or the \"positive\" bringing a sense of the normal, Hawaii is stunningly beautiful no matter how you view it.",
