    "description": "A fine art photograph of boat sails during a heavy summer thunderstorm on lake balaton in hungary.\n\nA thunderstorm on lake balaton is an experience not easily forgotten. The storm clouds gather and grow and darken the sky, until the lightning seemingly touches the surface of the calm lake water. Then comes the rain. In a matter of minutes, small ripples become white caps as waves crash against the boats, which bob up and down with the force of nature. Soon, the wind picks up to a deafening howl and sheets of rain rush over everything, transforming the lake into what feels like a giant washing machine.\n\nLake balaton is the largest thermal lake in europe, located in the transdanubian county of hungary. The lake is a popular vacation spot, as it has 10 beaches, hundreds of thousands of visitors come each year to its sandy shores.\n\n3000 x 1953 px | 300 Dpi\n\nFree signed fine art print and photo zine upon request.\n10% of sale will go to Avtonomni kulturni center Metelkova Mesto.",
