    "description": "OffsetAlign is an audiovisual thing I made inspired by blueprints and exploded diagrams.\n\nIt’s part interactive generative art system and part music performance… but was mainly an excuse to use my drums and synths to make some complex patterns from simple geometry in real time.\n\nThis is the performance that produced the 5 other stills in this collection.\n\n[1080 x 1920] MP4 \nMore info at brettbolton.net/offsetalign",
