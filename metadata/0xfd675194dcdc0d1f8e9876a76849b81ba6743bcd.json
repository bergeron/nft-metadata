    "description": "This remix of St Oshun's song \"Spotlight features the fabulous artist Ré Alissa.  The song was written about two young ladies from C-Dub’s high school memory.  These girls were haunted by past decisions because when the school found out what the girls had done, they constantly judged the girls for it. By writing this song C-Dub wanted to go back in time and say “Don’t let them get in your head.  Here’s the spotlight to remind you how incredible you are.”   When the music video’s creative director Ebonee Arielle reached out to Pretty Party, a LA based hair extensions brand, about the video, C-Dub retold his story of writing the song.  Pretty Party’s immediate reaction was to say, “We usually use our main property for video shoots but this song feels different, special.  How would you like to shoot at one of our other properties…specifically at Michael Jackson’s former residence.”  Of course, this left St Oshun wide eyed and honored, and this location allowed the artist duo to capture the island vibe they needed for the video.\n\nV1  \nHey Girl, what’s wrong  \nYou on bullshit fa too long  \nKnow I ride or die for ya bay  \nFuck that retrograde  \nMake that lemonade  \nYousa sweet thang lady\n\nDrop a fuck on what they say they so low  \nYousa diamond from all dat pressura  \nYou been through the cray  \nYa mama daughta baye,  \n I love ya thru da pain  \nWe gonna switch it up shortay\n\nPrechorus:  \nStatus low key shine like gloss ya,  \nHaters love to talk, no love lost, you exhaust me (yeah, yeah yeah)(that’s my shit)  \n100 percent, I’m still that lit bitch, yo my day one click, I fucks wit it \nIf any body askin, got no time I’m so fine\n\nChorus:  \nSpotlight (yolo get em)  \nGirl stop playin all I’m sayin shorty vibe (manifestin)  \nImma make a movie star of you tonight (real love lesson)  \nall these flashing lights ooh damn you so fine (ooh start checkin)  \nGirl recognize your Spotlight\n\n V2   \nGet em’ Re  \nBoy you know  \nYou know I know just how to move \nTeachin you just how I do  \nThings this fly (ain’t no trippin no)  \nCause you and I \nunder all these lights  \nComin so alive  \nThis could be paradise\n\nPrechorus:  \nIt’s hard to be \nthe baddest bitch around  \nAll eyes on me  \nyou should know by now  \n100 percent, I’m still that lit bitch, \nthese goodies drip drip, I fucks wit it \nIf any body askin, got no time I’m gone shine\n\nChorus:  \nSpotlight (yolo get em)  \nGirl stop playin all I’m sayin shorty vibe (manifestin)  \nImma make a movie star of you tonight (real love lesson)  \nall these flashing lights ooh damn you so fine (ooh start checkin)  \nGirl recognize your Spotlight\n\nBridge:  \nThis girl is on top (top)  \nDon’t sleep on me the work it don’t stop baby (hey hey hey)  \nThis girl is on top (top)  \nI know I’m rockin cause I got it on lock (hey hey hey)  \nWhosa Whosa\n\nStarlight  \nFlashin light like a cop light  \nSay you love to get on top right  \nWell shine bright this your spotlight (light, light, light))\n\nStarlight  \nFlashin lights like a cop light  \nSay you love to get on top right (What?)  \nShine bright this your spotlight, (light, light light) (Let’s go, get it)\n\nRap:  \nWelcome to the spotlight  \nAt the top lights flash like cop light  \nSo fly when we land taking top flight  \nNo coach first class rock star life  \nWe came to move  \nAin’t come to lose  \nTurn up the volume  \nWe made the news  \nWe on top now  \nAin’t no comin down from here  \nWe got the spotlight fame  \nWe found it here\n\nChorus:  \nSpotlight (yolo get em)  \nGirl stop playin all I’m sayin shorty vibe (manifestin)  \nYou deserve the world go get your Spotlight (real love lesson)  \nall these flashing lights ooh damn you so fine (ooh start checkin)  \nGirl it’s your night so realize your\n\nSpotlight (yolo get em)  \nGirl stop playin all I’m sayin shorty vibe (manifestin)  \nImma make a movie star of you tonight (real love lesson)  \nall these flashing lights ooh damn you so fine (ooh start checkin)  \nGirl recognize your Spotlight",
