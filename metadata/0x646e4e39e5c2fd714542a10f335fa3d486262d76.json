    "description": "Nature often unleashes its fury upon the world, especially with extreme weather.  But more often than not, humans are the real danger, as is the case with expansive legislation not only in the U.S. but worldwide that show hostility towards LGBQIA+ people.  Outright Int'l  exists to fight global discrimination against these groups, and I'm donating the entire proceeds of this mint to this important organization.    \nThis scene was captured in near Sonoita, Arizona on August 12, 2020.
