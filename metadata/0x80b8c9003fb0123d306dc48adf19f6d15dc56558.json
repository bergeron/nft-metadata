    "description": " I  find source materials and content in our environmental surroundings, looking for the border where harmony and disruption meet and where we can offer types of remedy to imbalance. An image works like an alchemical equation or a poem about something, a  place, or a life fracture that holds beauty and tragedy in a sentient relationship of elements. The visual subjects present a conflict between itself and elements that invade. I wish my work to speak of an inner sentient energy between all things living or static in active relationship. \n",
