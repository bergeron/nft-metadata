    "description": "This painting was painted by me in oil in a single copy, also in a single NFT. So that it would be unique in everything. This work is about the cold and alien infinite space above our heads. About the love and care of our neighbor. After all, people only have people.\n\nBuying the work you also get the original oil on canvas, which I will send anywhere in the world.\nThank you for your attention friends, take care of each other.",
