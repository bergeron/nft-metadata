Tens of thousands had taken to the streets demanding that President Muhammadu Buhari carry out police reforms. But the protests took a violent turn as soldiers opened fire with live rounds near the Lekki toll gate in the country's most populous city, Lagos. \"Within the next couple of weeks.\"The atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protestors, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags, while singing the national Anthem can be equated to a 'massacre' in context,\" the report stated.Officers and soldiers of the 65 Battalion of the Nigerian army left their base armed with both blank and live ammunition. \"AND THEY KILLED LOT OF YOUTHS, AND THE BRAVE ACTIVIST STANDING IS AISHA YESUFU\"",
