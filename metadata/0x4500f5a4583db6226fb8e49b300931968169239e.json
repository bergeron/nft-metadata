    "description": "The Cult Trite is a rare and valuable gold coin that grants the owner membership to the exclusive White Wolf order. This enigmatic organization is known for its secrecy and elitism, and possession of the Cult Trite is a symbol of one's membership in the group's inner circle. The coin is said to have powerful mystique and significance within the White Wolf order, though little is known about the coin or the order outside of its secretive membership.\n\n",
