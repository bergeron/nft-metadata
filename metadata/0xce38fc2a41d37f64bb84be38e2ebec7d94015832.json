    "description": "The Lycian Way is shown as one of the top 10 walking routes in the world. A unique road connecting ancient Aegean civilizations with a length of 540 km. We completed the 30-40 km part of this route in 2-3 days. 15 kg bags on our backs started to tire us unbelievably during the climbs. The landscapes within the route were moments like postcards. We had epic natural moments that we couldn't believe we were seeing. The perfume-like smells in the forest were deeply embedded in our memory. It had been a unique experience where everyone pushed their limits. In this drawing, I tried to describe the feeling of sharp rocks and thorny plants. I remembered the ethereum symbol once again while making the pointed rocks. At an altitude of 800 m, I saw the sea under our feet. I tried to capture this unique moment when butterflies and paragliders are the same size. Enjoy!",
