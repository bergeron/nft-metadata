    "description": "Legendary hip hop radio personalities Stretch and Bobbito collaborate with critically acclaimed designer/director Omar Acosta to create a 3D animated virtual cassette paying homage to hip hop’s transformative era. The NFT features a digitally remastered archival audio mic break from the duo’s groundbreaking 1990s radio show which was the launching pad for then unsigned and up-and-coming artists such as Nas, Jay Z, Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, Big Pun, the Fugees, Cypress Hill, and Eminem. Stretch produced a new beat to score and enhance the comedic excerpt.",
