    "description": "Vairāgya (वैराग्य) is a Sanskrit term used in Hindu as well as Eastern philosophy that roughly translates as dispassion, detachment, or renunciation, in particular renunciation from the pains and pleasures in the temporary material world. The Hindu philosophers who advocated vairāgya told their followers that it is a means to achieve moksha.\n\nAn ascetic who has subdued all passions and desires is called a vairāgika.\n\n2811  x  4138\n2,7 Mb",
