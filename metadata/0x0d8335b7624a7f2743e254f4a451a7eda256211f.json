    "description": "The photograph was part of a larger collection that was inspired by a film I wrote exploring how Americans are viewed and perceived in the public eye. The dove, crow, and eagle represented these various identities, while the pigeon, which was the most common bird in the area, later came to symbolize the masses. Through \"FREEDOOM,\" the pigeon takes center stage, a symbol of freedom and resilience. Amidst the hustle and bustle of city life, it reminded me to take a moment to appreciate the beauty of nature and the simplicity of life during a troubling time.",
