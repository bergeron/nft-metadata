    "description": "It was evening and she couldn't just stay out in the open for the night. Suddenly she saw a bridge in the distance and went there to find at least some shelter over her head. But as she got closer she noticed a large robot that was already overgrown with grass and bushes. He seemed very kind despite his size, so she decided to get closer to him....\n\n--(◕‿◕)--\nThis is a MaxZKH x Pali collaboration. We decided to combine unique robots and an interesting journey of a girl. The work is made in digital format with the help of a tablet and photoshop. Dimensions : 5900*5900 px / jpeg",
