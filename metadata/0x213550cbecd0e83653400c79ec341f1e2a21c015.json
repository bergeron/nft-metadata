    "description": "The beauty of New York City and its people inspired me to pick up a camera. There are infinite moments worth freezing in time here, they just need to be found and captured.\n\nThis is my genesis photograph, a moment about heartbreak.\n\nYou two sit down again after another loveless date. You can tell by their body language and tone that something isn't right. Then those three words come. \"We should talk.\"\n\nYou suddenly realize how close you are to the last chapter of your book together. You think back and things still haven't changed. The fights still happen, the spark still hasn't returned.\n\nThe love has dried, and the cracks show. Now all the gold in the world can’t fix it. No Kintsugi, just broken pieces of something that was once whole and beautiful.\n\nWas it you? Was there something that you could have done earlier? Maybe, but it’s too late now. The only thing left are the memories, until they fade too.\n\nStrangers, once again.\n\nThis is the first in a series of photos capturing candid moments through a 50mm lens.\n\n---\n\n11:11 pm, 10/3/2022  \nGramercy, Manhattan  \nNew York City\n\nCanon EOS M50m2  \n50mm f/1.8 STM  \n2240 x 3360\n\nEdition: 1/1",
