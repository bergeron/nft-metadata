    "description": "Assembly presents *Moving/Still* by Daniel Gordon, his first collection of still lifes made specifically as NFTâ€™s. Gordon is well-known for his figurative tableaus, which are created by assembling sculptures made from found imagery and photographed using a large-format camera. Movement is often implied in the objects, as the viewer experiences them from multiple perspectives. *Moving/Still* pushes this conceptual strategy to its limits as the objects vibrate back and forth. The sculptures, their shadows and backgrounds are unsettled through light, color or placement shifts, which suggest multiple possibilities for image construction and reveal technological as well as creative openness involved in the process. *Moving/Still* reflects on the age-old musings on passing of time, mortality and our relationship to interiors, nature and inanimate objects. Daniel Gordon is based in Brooklyn, New York. His work has been exhibited and collected internationally.",
