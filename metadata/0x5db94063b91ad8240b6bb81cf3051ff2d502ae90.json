    "name": "Bird of Paradise",
    "description": "The bird of paradise flower meaning includes joy and paradise, as it is the quintessential tropical flower. It originates from South Africa, where it is also nicknamed the Crane Flower. \n\nThis flower has been grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, South Africa since 1773. The scientific name for the bird of paradise is Strelitzia reginae, which was named by Sir Joseph Banks, who was the director of the royal gardens. \n\nHe named genus, Strelitzia, after Queen Charlotte who was the Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nThe bird of paradise gets its name from the fact that its flower is made of three bright orange petals and three blue petals which are fused together into a single bud.\n\n As the flower blooms, each petal makes its debut and the resulting shape mirrors that of a tropical bird in flight.",
