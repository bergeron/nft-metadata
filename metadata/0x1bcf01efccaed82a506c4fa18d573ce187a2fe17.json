    "description": "Art sees no boundaries. Culture connects things that exist in different eras and generations. \nAll of us consists of events through which we've passed since the childhood. Born in one culture, we are surrounded immediately with another one, blending unconsciously between different worlds. This fusion creates unexpected results, unexpected visual language that has never been used before.\n\nKids just enjoy their years without prejudice and preconception.\nPhysical// Igor Gorelikov\nDigital// Tim Baym",
