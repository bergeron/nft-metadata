    "description": "GARAGE TAPES continues with the second release from VOL. 1.\n\nthe garage was where i learned to create and not judge MAi self.  \n\ni was mainly producing/engineering for other artists during that time, and I never thought i would release anything i was making by MAi self.\n\nin hindsight, that allowed me to create without any fear. \n\n\"LiKE ME\" was first created around the same time as \"GLORiFiED\", and it continues to explore MAi experience with MAi past relationship.\n \nthe intro/hook was recorded about 4 years ago when the beat was first made, but the middle verse was recorded almost 2 years later. . . \n\nGARAGE TAPES VOL. 1",
