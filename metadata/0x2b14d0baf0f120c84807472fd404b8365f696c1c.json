    "description": "With strange experiments ongoing in a detachable lab mounted on the Tundra, there came a sudden burst of lightning which struck the ground and formed a pyramid-like structure. The structure now acts as a vessel for this obscure power, while trapping the souls of the Scientists and Alchemists involved in its creation forever. Nobody nears the Arcane as it is believed and rumored to attract human beings and collect their souls to feed the unknown source of its power. Some believe that it transforms you into a demon. \n",
