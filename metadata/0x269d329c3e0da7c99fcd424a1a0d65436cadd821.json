    "description": "Looping video portrait. A woman gazes into her own reflection as the moon rises behind her. As the water gently ripples and washes over her reflection, her image contorts and shifts.\n\nA moody and mesmeric video piece exploring aspects of identity and image.\n\nUsing rippling water and the ocean as a surface, these portraits shift and contort the identity of the gazer, in a dream-like haze. They are romantic, hypnotic, whilst also sometimes eerie.\n\n\n1920x1080p / 39 seconds on loop\n",
