    "description": "Years ago, it was the support of family, friends, and a handful of printed photographs that helped to fund my time working in Puerto Rico after the 2017 hurricanes. Today, I hope NFTs will allow me to continue what I set out to do then. I’ve always had aspirations of selling prints of my work and I’ve always had aspirations of directing that value toward a worthwhile cause bigger than myself. This first collection is special to me as it is set in Puerto Rico’s vibrant capital city. This is where it started for me, in the colorful streets of San Juan. \n\nThe sale of this NFT will benefit: \n[Habitat for Humanity of Puerto Rico](https://twitter.com/HabitatPR)\n\n\nEvery image of mine will be 1/1, 1:1. \n1/1 Non-Fungible Token : 1/1 Physical Print.\n\nIf the auction results in 3x the list price, the collector also receives the 1/1 museum quality print (printed by me). \n(My goal is to add value to both the NFT & Physical Print medium and incentivize a greater gift for the nonprofit beneficiary.)
