    "description": "First addition to Rated R collection influenced by 80s crazy movies.\n\nChild's Play is one of my favorite slashers. As part of being a solid horror movie, I think it's one of the most creative slasher movies ever. If you've watched the sequels before the original, you should give this gem a shot. Chucky will forever remain as my favorite evil doll.\n\n\n",
