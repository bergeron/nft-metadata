    "description": "The oldest known octopus fossil is about 296 million years old. Octopuses have three hearts, blue blood and can regenerate cut limbs. Two-thirds of an octopusâ€™ neurones reside in its arms. After mating, males wander off to die.\n\n___\n\nOCTOPUS DELIRIUM #1 is part of cross-chain series of works in which I explore the octopus as leitmotif."
