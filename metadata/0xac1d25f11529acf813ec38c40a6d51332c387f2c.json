    "description": "Sugarland is a moment in time, a seam between Fall and Winter. These exposures were taken on consecutive days. The second day it snowed and a fissure was created; an Eth Genesis was born. A 35mm film photograph, double exposed, soaked in boiling water, wine, hot sauce, ginger, and furniture polish â€” and developed in the home. A Jim Roll cross-chain film photograph.",
