    "description": "\nThe Elysium\n\nEdition 1/1 This artwork is one of my most time spent art piece which tells us about a fictional kingdom in which what if the mankind extinct a day and remains man made machinic giants.\n\nThis art work is my visualisation of a universe where we can’t find a mankind and remains a giant technological revolution and diverse skyscrapered fictional land.\n\nFuturism\n\nI made this artwork with injecting a sort of futurism and even retro-futuristic style to present the kingdom of Elysium a land of excessive technological possibilities without mankind.\n\nSTYLE\n\nThe artwork can be seen as huge mountains turned into skcyscrapers, this is to present the aesthetics and futurism towards my visualisation of Elysium. However the mountains and terrain can be seen as an abstract-shaped with excessive lighting’s which presents the city powerfully futuristic.\n\nResolution : ( 2000* x 3000* )",
