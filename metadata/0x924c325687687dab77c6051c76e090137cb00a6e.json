They wander around in the dark of night with a clattering sound, and find a live human, they attack and eat it.\n\nIn this work, flowers (=life) in the form of pear-shaped diamonds are contrasted with a skull (=death).\n\nThe subtitle \"Iris\" is named after the Japanese iris, the flower of Shibuya Ward, Tokyo, and the entire work is based on the same purple color as the flower.",
