    "description": "\nLove transcends everything \nIt's coded into our beings\nEtched into our very bones\nOutlasting even death\n\n\n\n\n\nALN Coded Ai Colors of Love represents the pure and permanent desire for love coded into all of us, for all our existence and beyond.\n\nOriginal subject art by James Suret titled Ai Colours of Love was put through AlittleNFT's code art process, converting the image line by line, pixel by pixel. It was finished in Adobe Premier Pro with a soundtrack added and a video created of the collaborative still-image art. The winning bidder from the primary sale will be buying this video and have the option to receive the corresponding still-mage art used to create the video minted as an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and transferred to the same wallet address that won the auction",
