    "description": "This video work is part of the series “Mutation#2” which includes 35 single edition videos depicting a painted portrait gradually being erased, layer after layer. As the human face disappears, the looming backdrop of a dark city takes its place, calm and mysterious, with its unchangeable habits and routines. The stage number, from 1 to 35 represents the stage of the portrait erasure. ",
