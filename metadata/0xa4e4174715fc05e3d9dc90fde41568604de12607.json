    "description": "Life is full of different paths and keys that unlock our purpose. We are all going through different paths just to find that purpose. Some people choose harder steps, and some easier ones. The outcome is different for those who sacrifice more than others. We all were meant to learn some things, but never meant to stay.  Life is just a big staircase, and at the top of it is a destination far greater than we know. And when we get to that destination, we will find an everlasting peace. But it might not be what you expected.\n\n3600 x 6760 PNG",
