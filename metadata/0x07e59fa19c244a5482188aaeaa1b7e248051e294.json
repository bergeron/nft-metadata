    "description": "I traveled to Buriram, Thailand in 2015, a guest of my brother's wedding. As part of the traditional ceremony, monks prayed over the couple, and as part of the tradition, gifts were presented to the monks, which included Thai Redbull. \n\nThis photograph was taken just after the ceremony, as the monks climbed into the back of their pickup truck, on the way to another ceremony.
