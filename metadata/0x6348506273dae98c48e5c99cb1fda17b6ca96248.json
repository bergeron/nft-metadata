Stare deep into the colors or simply cross your eyes to reveal a 3D image that will pop off the screen to greet you. If you are unable to make the Check appear, maybe ask a 90â€™s kid to teach you. Open edition will be open for 24 hours at .0069 eth with a max mint of 10. Once mint has concluded, phase 2 could begin any time. What image will appear next? ",
