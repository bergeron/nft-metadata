    "description": "Planet Zuzy’s debut single “Higher” is an ode to her global upbringing and love of eurodance music. The single was first born while Zuzy was away in Spain, overlooking the North African coast, she pulled out her laptop and recorded the captivating melody that drives the track today. She finished the track a few months later, and was ready to release it. One day she re-opened the session, and ended up turning the original trance version, into a classic Avicii inspired mainstage tune. The tracks ended up being so different, but complimentative of one another that Zuzy decided to release both versions. Higher is the epitome of what Planet Zuzy stands for, diversity in sound and euphoric melodies that make you feel like you’re flying. \n",
