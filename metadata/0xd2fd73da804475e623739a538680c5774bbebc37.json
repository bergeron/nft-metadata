    "description": "London, 2018\n\nFrom a series of photos taken on a short trip to Great Britain back in 2018\n\nShot with an early version of the Voigtländer Bessa R2 and a Jupiter 8 lens\n\nOn Kodak Portra 400, 35mm negative film\n\nThis photo was taken on a little trip I took with my sister back in 2018, and it is one of my first encounters with film photography. I received the prints a couple of weeks later and fell in love with the density of memories packed into each one; since then, film as a medium has changed my perception of photography and highly influenced my way of telling stories. \n\n1/1 NFT\n4155 x 6428 pixels\n\nCreated & donated by Leo Ludwigs (@leoludwigs)",
