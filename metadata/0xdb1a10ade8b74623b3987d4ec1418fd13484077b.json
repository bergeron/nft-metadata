    "description": "January 24, 2022, a rainy day 07:10 in the morning. \n\nI was driving on the highway and suddenly saw two big lights in my rearview mirror. At the same time my car started spinning, it seemed like an hour before it stopped. When I got out I was confused. I wanted to cross on the highway to flee, but someone stopped me. \n\nWho are all those people? \nwhat happened? \nwhere is my girlfriend? \n\nThere was a truck that hit me, the confusion continues. A concussion said the doctor where I suddenly sat.\n\nHow did I get here?\nWhere am I going?\nwhere did my car go?\n\nIt only takes a second to change or wipe out everything you have and are. But it takes ages to realize what happened, and why. At least if you still get that time.\n\nActually, this concussion is causing something else. A wake-up call. Life is too short to do things you don't want to do. So I'll stop with that right now. My future is in art. My path changes there. Promised. \n\nThis is the meaning behind this NFT concussion I made visual 1/1.",
