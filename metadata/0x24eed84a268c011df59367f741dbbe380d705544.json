    "description": "Who am I?  \nLooking up to becoming a better person, but I never see things working out as planned. \n\nI see myself losing my mum, \nI see myself watching my dad cry, \nI see myself breaking apart from my sisters, \nI see myself still believing in “Dreams come true”, \nI see myself hustling, struggling and hoping I will be better than this, \nI see myself in this new world full of monsters,  \nI see myself more depressed and confused, \nI see myself all alone in tears, \nI see myself dead.   \nI see myself asking now “Will I ever be better than this?” Before it’s late.   \nI see myself asking, “who am I?”  \n\nReally? I prefer to leave that up to the observer, because I will never finish answering that.",
