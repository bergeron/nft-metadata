    "name": "Pride and Prejudice",
    "description": "Pride and prejudice two simple words\nYet assembling colossal records\nThere he was filled with arrogance\nHandsome, rich, living in bitterness\nPrejudiced with too much pride\nNo place for love only for conceit\nNumb in senses\nCan't feel nor hear or see\nOnly himself and he;\n\nAnd he saw her\nEpitome of pride\nPride with no vanity\nPride with humanity\nBeautiful, charming, smart\nEyes glancing upwards\nReflecting heaven above\nA smile fills the darkest dwellings\nA heart lifted with love\nAll he did was to test her mind\nWilling to win the fight\nThe fight of pride\n\nHis vanity\nHer pride\nThat's what's all about\nJust when he left behind\nThings that made him blind\nShe could finally break the spell\nTo open his eyes\nTo where love truly lies\nAnd that's how my dear\nWe made it all clear\nPride and prejudice leads to fall\nLove conquers all!\n\n~Sarah Mawed~",
