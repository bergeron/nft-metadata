    "description": "1 of 20\n\nSpina Bifida. Often referred to as the snowflake condition, because no two cases are the same. Only roughly 1,400 babies are born each year with this condition and my son happened to fall into that statistic. \n\nHe was born prematurely at 26 weeks and had surgery at 2 days old to repair his spine. Weighing only 2 pounds 4 ounces - no one thought he would survive. The faces of the NICU staff will forever be imprinted in my mind.\n\nThis back scar, this diagnosis, changed everything for me. It forced me to see the world brand new, and it forced me to grow. \n\nScars. We all have them, but how we let them effect us is the only thing that matters. He is proof.  \n\n*Featured in Gallery of Refined Art \n*Featured in Shutter Up Magazine\n*Winner 2021 AFNS Awards\n",
