    "description": "This is the first single off of my upcoming album.\n\nThe album is a folk-electronic album, and I wrote, produced, and mixed it, in my bedroom in Hollywood. \n\nEach song morphed a thousand times until it took its final form. Each song also had 20+ mix bounces, emotional breakdowns, and rejoicing (while eating cake) when I finished them. This is the longest I have ever spent making a body of work. This is the first one out into the world. Thank you so much for listening, and I hope you like it <3 \n\nLove, \nValentina \n\n\n",
