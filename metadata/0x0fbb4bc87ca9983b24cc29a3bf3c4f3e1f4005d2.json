    "name": "Desert Snow",
    "description": "One of my favorite images from the sunny state. This single image depicts the range of geographies this state has to offer from desert lands to snow-covered mountains. On a crispy day in February, me and my wife drove in live snow to reach our destination in Eastern Sierra. I only came across this location/composition when we pulled over to take some rest after being out for 7-8 hours. Having desert shrubs and snow-covered mountains in a single frame is probably unusual if it is not for California. \n\nEdition 1/1\nDimensions: 6260 x 4174 (300 DPI)\n\nLicense: Primary collector is free to use the image in advertising, display privately and in groups, virtual galleries, documentaries including derivative works as long as the creator is credited.
