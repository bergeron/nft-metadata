    "description": "Chaotic Holiday is a photographic composition made of cutouts from specimens of analog prints. This artwork captures brief moments stolen from my memories, which can be unsharp and blurry on their own, but it is exactly when one captures them in a greater key that they take on a deeper meaning. This edition tell the story of a chaotic holiday, a trip along 6 different countries visited during the last years.",
