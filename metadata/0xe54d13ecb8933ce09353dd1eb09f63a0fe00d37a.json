    "description": "Above & Beyond @ Bill Graham Auditorium (San Francisco, CA) â€“ March 14, 2015\n\nUp in the balcony at Bill Graham, Above & Beyond had a great laser setup that was two layers: one going up and one going straight across to the floor of the balcony I was on. With great timing, I was able to get this photo of them surrounded by lasers in a v-shaped space.\n\nCamera Info:\nCanon 1D X\nEF 24-70mm f/2.8 II USM\n\nShot Info:\n63mm\n1/30 sec\nf/2.8\nISO 800",
