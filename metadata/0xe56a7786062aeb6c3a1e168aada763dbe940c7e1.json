    "description": "Telepopmusik, an iconic post-French touch band, is releasing its first NFT here with La Moufle, an audiovisual creation studio already in charge of all the videos for their latest album “Everybody Breaks The Line”.\n\nThe sheeps on the album cover challenge us, they act as a mirror of our own anxieties, a kind of passage towards a parallel world under tension.\n\nThis drop in the form of a main NFT and 6 small variations, reveals to us this matrixian world sublimated by Greg Boust 3D artist at La Moufle.\n\nThe music is a bonus track only available on the vinyl version of the album - Telepopmusik “Broken Queen” feat Sylvia Black.",
