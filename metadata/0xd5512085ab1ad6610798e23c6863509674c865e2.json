    "description": "'Finding focus' is an accumulation of imagery that has shaped the direction of my work. \n\nEach image is unique within itself. Little details that draw the focus of the eye. These details showcase the beauty within an otherwise intimidating ocean. \n\nThroughout my career I have continued to develop my process to really showcase the sheer volume of the incredible ocean I am surrounded by. These huge southern ocean swells smash the Western Australian coastline with such violence that it's easy to miss the small elements within. The images capture a moment in time that draws your attention to an incredible volume and weight of water. \n\n'Finding focus' is not only a collection but a mindset that I have applied over the years.  Years of oceanic knowledge and passion for the environment has sculpted my work. I want to showcase the ocean to the world in a way no one has seen before. \n\nThank you for being a part of this journey.",
