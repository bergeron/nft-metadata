    "description": "AI algorithms coproducing a film on loss, mourning, and memorialization.\nWhile one AI paints scenes tuned to these experiences, another composes songs that root the piece in a haunting tone.\n\n\nAI generated lyrics:\n\nThe flower of memorialization is a daguerreotype of the mourners.\nThe mourning is done with precision, but the flowers are not.\nWhat on earth is this?  Where is this memorial?  Where is the memorial? \n\nThe flowers are so small, the image is so small, the image is so small,  I have no power.\n\nThe cemetery is haunted by the dead, and the film will ruin the environment.",
