    "description": "'ARCTIC DREAMSCAPE' is the genesis drop of FRVNK. The photo was taken at sunset during an expedition in the Svalbard Arctic, capturing a dreamy and ethereal landscape of ice and snow. It also showcases the rugged, untouched wilderness of one of the world's most remote regions.\n\nby FRVNK / Frank Liu\n\n---  \nCollectors will be given Extended Editorial rights, which can be used to display the artwork privately or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
