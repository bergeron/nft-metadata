    "description": "The Bond Fire burns in Orange County near Silverado and Santiago Canyons overnight Thursday December 3rd, 2020. The blaze exploded under strong Santa Ana winds. The fire burned around 3,000 acres. No homes were confirmed lost but some outbuildings were damaged. \n\nI stood in a shower of hundreds of embers over multiple exposures to get the framing and ember trails right. I was wearing full wildfire PPE, including nomex shirt, pants, hand-made fire boots, helmet, goggles, gloves, P100 respirator, and fire shelter. Despite fire-resistant protection I still felt stings anywhere skin was exposed as the embers flew in.\n\nThis fire was visible from my own home, and burned where I learned about wildfire, and hiked during my fire training. The area of inland Orange County, CA is one of the most active wildfire corridors in the United States. \n\n50% of the net proceeds from this 1/1 genesis NFT sale will benefit the Sierra Institute to help rebuild after the Dixie Fire in Plumas County.",
