    "description": "I've been drawn to astrophotography for years after discovering I could capture beauty my eyes couldn't see.\n\nI find startrails particularly fascinating because the final result isn't a reflection of what your camera captures; you need to put your images through an intensive process to see the magic reveal itself. I like to think of it as an alternative reality we can only access through a series of digital manipulation tasks.\n\n2 collectors will be selected randomly to receive a print of the photo version.
