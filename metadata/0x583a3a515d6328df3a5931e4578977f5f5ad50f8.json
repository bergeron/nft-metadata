    "description": "This series of street portraits was done between April and May 2020, shortly after the covid's worldwide release was announced.\n\nToday we are unfortunately used to see ourselves in the streets wearing masks, but at that time it was still a strange thing but above all you could not go out in the streets easily for the high risk of contagion.\n\nWe were few in the streets and we went out only to walk the dog, for work, for emergencies, for buy basic necessities or outdoor sports. \n\nFinding ourselves in those moments, alone, still a bit shocked and incredulous by the recent events related to covid was strange. On the one hand everyone was suspicious and afraid of the other, on the other there was the desire to interact. \n\nStopping these people on the street to ask them if they could take a portrait at a time like that had not only a documentary value, but led to a rapprochement and mutual comfort and even just through an exchange of words and a photograph.",
