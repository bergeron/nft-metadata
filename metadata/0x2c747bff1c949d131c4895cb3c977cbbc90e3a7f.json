    "description": "We've created unique \"Quantum AI Data Paintings\" using quantum bit strings generated from Google Quantum AI team's beyond classical experiment together with a Generative Adversarial Network machine learning algorithm that was developed during the production of Quantum Memories.\n\nThe data collection consists of 200 million raw images of landscapes around the world, including all the national parks in the US.\n\nBy utilizing custom procedural coherent noise implementations and beyond classical measurements of computing surflets, we generated 1000 unique Quantum AI Data Paintings inspired by the natural world. Each painting is computed with a unique quantum bit string!\n\nThe images incorporate earthly pigments, shapes, and patterns that we associate with our sensory experiences, while paying homage to the Earth's unbounded poetic sublimity.\n\n10110111000001101111100010110101100100100111101101000",
