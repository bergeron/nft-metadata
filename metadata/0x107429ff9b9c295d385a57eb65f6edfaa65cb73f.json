    "description": "\"It takes two to tango\", they say.  \nThe pieces in this brand new collection dance better together, in pairs, but they are also ready to dance solo.\n\nProfessionally a designer, photography is a very organic extension of my work, for 20 years. I believe I have a specific style and point of view, coming from design, translated into my pieces. I wanted to melt my 2 passions into one ongoing collection, to push my limits, and get out of my comfort zone, while delivering something fresh and different, as I refuse to put myself in a box.\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
