    "description": "\n\nThis is a collision between 2 water drops in mid air.  One drop is coming up, as part of a rebound column that has split.  The second is coming down, released at a precise time by an electromagnetic valve, to meet the other drop as it rebounds up.\n\nThe lighting is from behind.  Two flash units firing at approximately 1/25,000 of a second, freeze the motion, revealing what is happening at the moment of impact.  The colors come from gel filters placed over each flash unit, chosen to compliment each other and provide a pleasing palette for the eye.\n\nFor much more information on images like these (and others) and the process behind them, please check out my Discord at https://discord.gg/G4JPcPyJkK here.\n\nAnd feel free to reach out to me, as I am always happy to engage with people who are interested in my artwork.\n\nCheers, Max \n\n\n\nTechnical info:\n\nDigital image without any post production alteration.\n6000 pixels x 4000 pixels @ 360 PPI resolution.
