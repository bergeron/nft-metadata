    "description": "Books have the ability to transport us to other worlds, we can travel thousands of miles with our imagination. Many characters, places, life experiences, learnings, are encapsulated in its pages.\nThe girl in this moving artwork is immersed in her own universe, where nothing is impossible, with her innocence and her ability to dream, still intact, going through the pages of her book. Join me on this surreal journey, let's be like children, let's learn that the only limits are in our heads. \n\nJose Luis Am Art\n",
