    "description": "This cute little creature is Phidippus Putnami , which belongs to the family of jumping spiders . They are ambush Hunters with amazing hunting skills . They have spectacular eyesight, having two forward-facing primary eyes, have incredibly high resolution, and see in both color and UV light. These horned spiders are very bold and powerful, preying upon other spiders of different species , even bigger in size.\n\nFound this little cute furball in my garden , immediately rushed into home to take the Macro gears, and got the perfect photograph after hours.",
