    "description": "Catherine Gfeller has covered the city of Kyiv in 2017 with Ukrainian writers. Together, we walked through the streets of Kyiv, exploring the scars and traces of the fighting, war memorials and all the places where life picks up in the middle of the ruins.\t\t\t\nEven though the images of the war remain embedded in the national memory, the crowds moving through the city are a symbol of hope in response to the tragic events.\n\nThe project Voices in KyivÂ has been exhibited at the Shevchenko National Museum in Kyiv in 2018 (multimedia installations).\n\nSize: 60 x 180 cm\nDate: 2017-2018\nEdition: 1/5\n\nThis NFT is linked to the physical artwork.\nDelivery fees excluded.\n\n",
