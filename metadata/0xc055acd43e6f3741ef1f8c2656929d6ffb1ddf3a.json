    "description": "heavens pour to cover up under the white shawl. \nThrough cold waves, my warm body melts  cotton. \nMy red finger tips sucks the warmth from kangri inside my pheran  \nJust waiting at the station to see the faces of strangers.  \nWith each train there are dreams, dreams with faces.  \nI often look at myself in them while they stare \nWith freezing time, the signals appear frozen at the heart \nAnd still sparks on the signals amaze me with the hope of a new destination.",
