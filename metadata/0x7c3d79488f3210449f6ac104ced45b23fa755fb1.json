    "description": "pareh-fishing is one of the oldest methods of catching bony fish, including whitefish, on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea (Gilan and Mazandaran provinces-iran), which is several hundred years old. In this method, a head of net, which is usually 1000 meters long and 7 to 10 meters high, is spread by a large wooden boat in the English U-shaped sea, and the end of the net returns to the shore at a distance of about one hundred meters from the starting point. The diameter of the fin nets is large enough to catch only adult fish and is therefore very effective in conserving aquatic and juvenile stocks. (Between 30 and 40 mm). After a while, the net is pulled from the end to the shore by force and inch tractor and collected. As a result, the fish trapped inside the net are gradually directed to the shore and collected by fishermen.",
