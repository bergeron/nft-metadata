    "description": "In the small town called Hope's End, life was quiet and uneventful. But all of that changed one night when an UFO appeared in the sky above the town.\n\nFive teenagers were laughing and telling scary stories when they noticed something weird in the sky. At first, they thought it was just a shooting star, but then it began to move erratically across the sky. As they watched in awe, the object suddenly stopped and hovered just above the trees. It emitted a pulsing light that seemed to change colors, and the teens could hear a humming sound. They all pulled out their phones and started recording, then watched as the object slowly began to descend, its light illuminating their faces. When it was gone, the teens found themselves with their phones still recording. They kept their experience a secret from their families, but they knew they weren't entirely alone.\n\nCreated with: Midjourney V4 & Photoshop\nLocation: Lisbon, Portugal\nEdition: 1/1\nYear: 2023\nDimensions (in pixels): 2048 x 2048",
