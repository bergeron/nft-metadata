    "description": "Society is off track. We all feel it. What’s wrong? How do we fix it without throwing out all the good parts? Tim Urban answers these questions.\n\nTim Urban is a blogger, writer, and illustrator, who is best known for his blog \"Wait But Why.” \n\nStarted in 2013, “Wait But Why” covers various topics, from science and technology to social issues and human behavior. \n\nTim recently wrote a book titled: “What's Our Problem?: A Self-Help Book for Societies,” which Ryan and David think offers a roadmap for the tribal crypto communities battling in the Web3 landscape.\n\nThis is another episode on our journey exploring AI alignment. \n\nArtwork generated from the quote “We are a survival species. We are a bunch of survivors. And that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been horrible tragedies, genocides and awful things in the past. And we also have never faced a full kinds of existential threat. But I do think humanity has a knack for surviving. And that if we get scared enough, I think maybe that will be reason to prevail out of pure fear and pure survivor instinct.”  \n\n10% of proceeds go to Bankless DAO.",
