    "description": "In 2015, poet and artist Rupi Kaur was banned by Instagram for posting a photo of a fully clothed woman menstruating. \nShe stated “I bleed each month to help make humankind a possibility, my womb is a home to the divine, a source of life for our species, whether I choose to create or not”. \n\nThis piece is a response to the misogyny and hypocrisy of social media celebrating semi nakedness but censoring something as natural as breathing.\n\nKaur stated that it is a “bridge between this universe and the last”.",
