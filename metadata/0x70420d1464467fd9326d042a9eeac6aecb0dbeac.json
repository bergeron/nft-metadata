    "description": "Don't you miss those days when you were just a kid and your biggest problem in life was deciding which color of gummy bear to eat first? \n\nAs I grow, I find myself missing my childhood more as life was so much simpler back then and fond memories like this often bring me comfort that at least I enjoyed the earlier part of my life. \n\nWhile we can't rewind time, do yourself a favor,  take a break and treat yourself to some gummies!\n ",
