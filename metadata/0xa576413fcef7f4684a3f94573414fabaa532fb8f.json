    "description": "Macro photography is like a secret world. A world which is not visible to the naked eye. It makes us see the beauty in the details by making small subjects look larger. Through this series, I captured tiny and ordinary objects, subjects and textures in a way that the human eye cannot see them. It might appear like lifeless phenomenons but the magnification makes them like they are from another planet, taking our breaths away.",
