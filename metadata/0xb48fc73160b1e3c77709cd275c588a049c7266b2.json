    "description": "Push Me Too Far \nproduced, written and performed by Mari\nco-produced by Segnon\nbass by Clark Simz\nmixed and mastered by Manic Phase\ncover art photographed by Segnon \ncover art blend with ai and edited by Mari\n\nIn my feelings one night, playing with ableton, this song started to pour out. I was tired of being caught in cycles that never break no matter how painful they become. Patterns in music and patterns in life. Cycles of abuse or misunderstanding that led to pain in intimacy, community and larger exploitative institutions. Infused in this song is a vow: this will be the last time. With this release I am empowering myself as a sovereign artist and individual: alive, human, imperfect, and fully embodied.\n\nAfter living with this song for a while, I brought it to Segnon’s studio to track some bass from Clark Simz. Clark laid down his brilliant bass and Seg and I watched the song shift directions. This version was asking to be more raw. Channeling being pushed too far, I broke my voice, then sustained that tension until my breath went out and the song could find release. \n\nI love that the culture and technology within web3 allow us to break free from institutionalized patterns of control. And I won’t come back ;) This is the first drop from MARI season 1.\n",
