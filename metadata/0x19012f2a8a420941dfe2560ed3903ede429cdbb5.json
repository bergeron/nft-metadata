    "description": "It has been a journey with myself and Tailormade Tyson. We have been on this musical trip for around 20 years. From battle rapping and ciphers in grade school, to making our earliest records in his moms garage in the wee hours of the morning. \n\nWe have traveled the country in a quest to fulfill our dreams, and have spent a countless amount of money out of our own pockets to accomplish everything we have. Sometimes that can be frustrating when you dont see a return but passion for us has always been more important.\n\nWith that being said web3 has changed things for me. I want to bring him into this community so he can see that there are people in the world that value our music both monetarily, and just from a human aspect.\n\nSpace Jazz is a collab between me and him. I wish I could tell you a super deep meaning behind the song but its simply about some of our favorite things..... \n\n                                      Lust and Mary Jane.\n\nProduced, Mixed and Mastered by: Twenty Duce\nWritten by: TailorMade Tyson x Twenty Duce\nArtwork by: A.I. and Twenty Duce \n",
