    "description": "This work is the alternative version of 'Usagi Tsukino' artwork which is became the opposite version of the main artwork, or i shall call this as the \"classic me\" version when the main work was quiet much looks colourful and having much digital work looks on it. \nSo if you pair the both of it, then you will get neither the classic vibes one and the modern vibes one, just like my whole artwork concept that often speak about the myth that live amongst us for the past, the present and the future.\n\n'Usagi Tsukino Classic Theme' limited for just 8 edition only.",
