    "description": "The Wind Cried, 2022 (1 out of 3)  is an almost still video piece. Based on a fragile and elaborate baroque-like porcelain sculpture, which depicts organic forms, seashells, a female open hand. it offers a sensual, seductive and enigmatic ceremony. the flickering candles serve at the same time as a Memento Mori - a reminder of passing time, and as a spiritual pause.",
