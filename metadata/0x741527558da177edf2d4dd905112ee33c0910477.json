    "description": "\"Into The Light\" \n\nIt is imperative to step into thought patterns that motivate us, bring about happiness, and keep our minds away from dark thoughts that bring our spirits down. \n\nWhen I see this image, I am reminded of the extent to which we are surrounded by darkness, and not just physically.\n\nThere is no doubt that our own thoughts are the biggest source of motivation. Despite not always being in the mood, thoughts become the biggest obstacle to living an enjoyable life. \n\nConsequently, my challenge is to think beyond ourselves and inspire ourselves in a way that leads us to achieve our best. Step into the light!",
