    "description": "I have never seen your face and yet you come in my dreams to guide me and love me, I do not know that you exist or not, the kind of love one seeks in their lifetime. \nI see you in my delusional world, I see you in my dreams yet I do not know who you are but I love you and I'll always will. Perhaps your essences exits in a different realm. \nWe are one in my dreams and perhaps it's where we can only meet. I guess I wouldn't want it any other way.\n",
