    "description": "‘The Origin of Lux’ was discovered by Edward Morris in 1859 just outside a village in Southern England. This finding was unprecedented and started a chain of discoveries that would open humanity to the possibility of a broader universe.\n\nThe object had the ability to emit and project light. Many believed it was sent by the Gods to assess our planet. Others were convinced it was part of an entirely new species from another civilization.\n\nThe object has since disappeared from it’s place of discovery and took with it any chance of establishing origin or meaning.",
