    "description": "April 2021 / Following long processes spanning several years, I started working on a series of shorter video sketches earlier this year. My objective was to practice digital collages and compositions and find ways to combine my multiple ongoing series in different mediums created over the past few years. This series incorporates aerial collages, photos and videos recorded on passenger flights, animations of individual Python-processed video frames based on scanned rubber-stamps sets, AI-generated images, and digital drawings. / mlo.art / First collected by calling dibs by @elsie_edicurial on September 5th, 2021, 1:51 PM.",
