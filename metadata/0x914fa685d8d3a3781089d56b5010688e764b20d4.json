    "description": "<< Unconditional Remnant #1 >>\n\nUnconditional Remnants is a collaborative artwork between Thomas Noya & Miguel Noya. An exploration into reactions of extreme emotional distress and the illusory effects of words in the imagination – The feelings of a nomad facing the ocean while fixating on the nostalgic memories of the stillness of sea waves and pulsating hearts.\n\n•\n\nVisuals: Thomas Noya.\nMusic: Miguel Noya.\n\n1080 x 1080 px | 30 fps | 00:30 | mp4\n\n2021\n\n•\n\nThis piece was created by combining multiple latent space interpolations from various personal GAN models and original music.\n\n•\n\nFeel free to contact me for access to a hi-res version.",
