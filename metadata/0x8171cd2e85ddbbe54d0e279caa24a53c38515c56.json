    "name": "Slater Park Bokeh Christmas Lights - Sange Photo",
    "description": "Slater Park - The oldest public park located in Johnston, Rhode Island. They decorate most of the park with Christmas lights and holiday decor, attracting people from all over RI (and neighboring states). If there's one thing I really love taking pictures of, it's Christmas lights! How beautiful is that bokeh (pronounced Bo-Kay) effect of the out-of-focus lights in the background? I literally had to lay on my back and shoot upwards to get the shot I wanted... totally worth it. ",
