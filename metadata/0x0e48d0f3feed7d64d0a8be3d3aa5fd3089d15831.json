    "description": "Taken on my first roadtrip around the western United States.\n\nAs we drove by new beautiful places every day, I couldn't help but think of what else I was missing. Myself and fellow photographers Jen Caywood, Joey Miller, Briscoe Park, Jesse Dylan and Moosechild Departed from Washington State in early July to explore the western USA. Being able to surround myself with such talented creators and wonderful people so early in my photographic journey was key in my growth as an artist. We ventured to numerous states such as Oregon, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho taking photos along the way. I hold so many fond memories of that summer, Its experiences continue to mold me as a person to this day. This particular evening out in the Bonneville Salt Flats was one of the more beautiful evenings of my adventure. As sunset turned to twilight we sat there and stared at the sky, watching it turn this beautiful shade of purple as we thought of what lied ahed.",
