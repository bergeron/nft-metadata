    "description": "Square Victoria was where I would get off to work every morning of the week, of course it also was the first subway station on my way back. The end and a new beginning. The entrance is located at the heart of the city financial disctrict.\n\n---\n\nMetropolis is a play on the word \"metro(subway)\" and \"polis\" which means \"city\" in greek.\n\nEach of the 6 pieces collection is associated to a subway station from the \"Société des Transports de Montréal\".\n\nWhy these six?\n\nIt's simply because it's the 6 station I used the most when I was working in downtown Montréal, about 15 years ago.\n\nThe top down view suggest an \"Heat Map\" of the city at those key locations.\n\nEverything is made using Javascript and P5.js.\n\n32x22 inches\n9600 x 6600px",
