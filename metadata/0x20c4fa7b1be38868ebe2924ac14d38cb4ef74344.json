    "description": "_paperspace x Joon Young-Lee\n\nA collaborative piece by _paperspace and Korean digital painter Joon Young-Lee.\n\nTitled \"Sanctuary\", this piece seeks to express a refuge, a sense of serenity away from the external stimuli of the world.\n\nJoon's powerful strokes and use of color seeks to portray seemingly the movement of clouds, of the sky and of emotion.\n\nThe calmness of clouds is coupled with the uncertain nature of rain - similar to life itself. We run many marathons, often in our minds - and sometimes we inevitably need an escape, a refuge, a sanctuary.\n\nCoupled with Paper's aesthetics and avatar - in which her expression, her posture and style brings forth a certain sense of beauty amidst the uncertain tension, serves as a negotiation between the tangible and intangible, an invisible bridge between the visual and one's emotions.\n\nThe piece comes together to bring forth a state of being, and as an intensification of one's emotion.\n\n8032 x 16000 pixels\nYear of production: 2023",
