    "description": "A frequency is defined as the number of times a periodic phenomenon occurs within a time interval - simply visualized as a wave. Algocardiogram is a generative data visualization script that creates a wave pattern from your heart rate. Inspired by the electrocardiogram machines used in the medical industry, but with an algorithmic twist. It is a mathematical interpretation of your BPM over time. During an Adiem session, your heart rate is recorded. The resulting list is fed into the algorithm, which generates a unique wave pattern based on the data values, as well as the overall amount of data. The more your heart rate changes over time, the more interesting the resulting pattern will be. Some good ways to change your heart rate are meditation or breathing exercises.\n\n        You need an AlgoCardiogram Access Pass to access your heart generated photos. Mint your access pass here https://www.synerative.com/algocardiogram\n        You need the free Adiem watch app to record your heart.
