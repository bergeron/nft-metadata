    "description": "When a new civilization will be at the intersection of living matter and technology. When blood, coolant and brake fluids flow through the veins of evolving species, and instead of eyes and ears, they will have sensors. At this time, people will adapt, change physically. But there are things that will remain unchanged: the preservation of culture, the memory of past events and the development of internal character traits inherent in wars and researchers of everything new.\n\nThis work shows how people of the future imagine great warriors based on stories, legends and stories, although they themselves have never seen them.\n\nThe concept was that after the creation of the samurai armor, each of its details was changed and this was repeated over and over again until the end of the competition was close.\n\nWith these actions, I wanted to find out what makes a samurai a samurai or how much you can change the image, but at the same time not lose the original message\n\nWinner AMD Design Award 2021",
