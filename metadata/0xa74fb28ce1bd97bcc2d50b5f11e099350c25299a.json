    "description": "\"This photographic artistic project explores the themes of intimacy and privacy, delving into the complex relationship between the photographer and the subject, and the line between voyeurism and art. The images captured individuals in moments of solitude, frozen in time, inviting the viewer to consider their own relationship to privacy and the act of observation. The balconies are depicted as the space in between the privacy of the home and the exterior world, highlighting the thin line between public and private spaces.\"",
