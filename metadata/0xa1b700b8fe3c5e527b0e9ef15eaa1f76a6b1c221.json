    "description": "_Mandaleido scope : Mandala + kaleidoscope.\n\n_No graphics and special effects. I just filming of kinetic art device \n\n_The Mandala figure, which contains the core of Buddhist philosophy, was reinterpreted and made into a kinetic media work.\n\n_A Mandala is a Buddhist painting. It is a transliteration of the Sanskrit word, मण्डल (Mandala) meaning “circle.” The circle of Mandalas contains the truths of the universe. \n\n_ I have seen Tibetan masters paint Mandalas using colorful sand. carefully pick up sand with their fingertips and scatter it to make a picture. From the center to the outside, it takes a long period of time to be completed. The end result of this beautiful and impressive sand picture is shocking: Just when the picture is completeed, it is swept away in an instant.\n \nThis shows the Buddhist philosophy that all the beauty of the world is fleeting and therefore there is nothing to be obsessed with.  \n\n_4K 60f\n\n_music : egotrip\n",
