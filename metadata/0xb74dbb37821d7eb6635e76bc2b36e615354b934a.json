    "description": "\"Mother\" is a word which fills everyone with emotions! When the child is born, a mother is born and from that moment onwards, her life revolves around her child. Mom knows how to make things better. It doesn't matter what she's dealing with, she will still, always, find a way to make the situation better for the child. \n\nI am a Mom of a 5 year old & a 8 month old. My kids are everything to me. As we do not plan to have anymore kids, this June it would be my 1st birthday having my complete family with me. And to celebrate this special day and year. I want to share this image that is very special to me, with the world. \n\nThis image, \"Mommy's got your back\",  is dedicated to my kids. \n\nThis Image helped me win a Gold Medal and was published in 2020's Loan Collection Book for Professional Photographers of America. The Loan Collection Book exhibits the best of the year from the International Photographic Competition.",
