    "description": "Heartâ€™s Law identifies the similar crypto market moves due to their trading pairs bonded by liquidity. Richard Heart was the first to recognize this phenomenon and explain it in simple terms for all to understand.\n\nYou should evaluate your portfolio; first, check how much of your assets are paired with coins such as BTC and ETH to assess whether or not there is risk in riding the bear market down when those assets are dropping. Diversifying your portfolio with cryptos that move freely in the market due to bonded pairs with stablecoins can help hedge your investments against the bear market.\n\nBy: Shawn K",
