    "description": "We build cities and we call them our home, they become our world. \nWe go blind about the other world - nature, which is always there in a constant almost invisible presence. And even without knowing it, we affect nature as it affects us. \nHemsley captures the complex cities that we build, concrete spaces that exalt our ingenuity but at what cost?\nLiniika depicts the sublimity of nature that we sacrifice as we turn to technology and artificial everything. \nWe offer the world this piece as a question and a challenge. \n",
