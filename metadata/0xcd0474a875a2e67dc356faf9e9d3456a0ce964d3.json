    "description": "This moment was one of the most insane experiences that contributed to the capturing of the image. \n\nI saw this cow from a mile away. They  were grazing on the field as I was driving in the hills of Chintapalli, Andra Pradesh - India. \n\nAfter a long confusing chase, the impulse of a photographer to run for the shot was misunderstood by the man in the frame, he thought i was chasing down to attack him, and start running away from me! \n\nIt was hilarious, finally the locals gathered everyone, when it was clear to the man and the cow, I just wanted to capture them out of deep admiration. \n\nJust as this harmony was attained, as soon as I clicked the shutter..... a dragon fly welcomes itself into the frame. \n\nThis is what I call magic people. This image is a talisman for that magic and the beauty and participation of Nature in our sentient lives.  ",
