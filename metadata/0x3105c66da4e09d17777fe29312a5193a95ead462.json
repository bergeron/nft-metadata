    "description": "GSW Originals // \"Blue by You\" // a series by Grayson Warren, 2022\n\nA series of four 1/1 photographs taken during twilight on Fox Island, located in Washington State. \n\nTwilight turned to dusk on September 17th, 2020; \na deep blue haze and it's leaden shadow swept over the numbingly cold waters of the Kitsap Peninsula, ascended a cliff-side, and slipped over an exposed bluff--creeping it's way into in the cabin where my girlfriend and I had escaped to celebrate our anniversary. \n\neverything went still. neither of us spoke a word. any remaining daylight surrendered itself to the night. \n\ncalled to the water, we sunk beneath the haze when I surrendered too, \n\nfeeling blue by you.",
