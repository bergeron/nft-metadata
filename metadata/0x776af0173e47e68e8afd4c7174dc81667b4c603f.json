    "description": "'River Road' serves as my first photography edition. This image was taken on a spring night in 2017 and captures a few of the elements that make Louisiana's River Road so unique. As the name implies, this road follows the path of the Mississippi River, running alongside the levees designed to protect the community. One of the most traveled roads in Louisiana, River Road is lined with historical sites, oak trees, and a number of flood prevention operations.",
