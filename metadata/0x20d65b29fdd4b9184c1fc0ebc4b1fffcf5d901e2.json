    "description": "May 2018. I'm out shooting the streets of Osaka. It's been 2 months since I moved here already. Time flies. I'm here in Namba, the most famous and very touristy neighborhood of Osaka. I'm on this bridge when I see this guy in front of this gigantic, colorful, full of Japanese billboard. This place is a famous restaurant all over Japan called \"Yoshinoya\", open 247. First, I try to capture this picture with the face of the person visible. Soon I realize how much more powerful the picture is when only his silhouette is visible. I change the settings of my camera, and push the shutter.\n\nHow the silhouette is looking on the right reminds me of when I get lost in this new city, looking left and right, trying to find my way while checking the map on my phone, too scared to ask because I'm not confident in my Japanese language skills, thinking \"Where Am I\", panicking a little bit. But it's all part of the journey.\n\nPNG | 2500x4000px | 9.4MB",
