Moments whether it’s jokes or sharing food, or just fun conversation, no matter how apart they are, the heart knows its valuable friends. Friendship is built on a foundation of mutual trust, pillars that have the perspective that is in line with each other, the interior of the same interest, and a roof where we are always safe when sheltered.\n\n3543 × 3543px, RGB, digital, November 2022",
