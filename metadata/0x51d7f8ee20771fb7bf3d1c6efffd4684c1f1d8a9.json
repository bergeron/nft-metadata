    "description": "Analog Photography + AI (2023) \n\n8192*8192, JPG. \n\nExperiential composer and visual artist Austin Rockman paints upon multiple canvases, sound and image. Austin's dreamscapes are guided by a visceral engagement with the medium, playing upon the layered strata of subconscious interactions. His is a world of metaphor and poetry, abstraction and haze, fractal and fog, rebirth and decay, turbulence and quietude. \n\nAustin has been intimate with the artistic process for the better part of a decade, this piece marks his ETH genesis and first gallery showcase.
