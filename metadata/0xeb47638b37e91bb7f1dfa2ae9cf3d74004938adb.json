    "description": "The ancient Greek folk religion belief in nymphs survived in the country until the early years of the 20th century, when they were generally known as \"Nereids\".\n\nAccording to myth, nymphs used to frequent areas far from humans, but could be found by lone travelers, who could hear their music and sometimes manage to spy on them dancing or bathing in a stream, during the heat of midday or in the middle of the night. \n\nSuch encounters can be dangerous, bringing crazed passion, madness, or stroke to the unfortunate who sees her.\n\nAI + photography  \n4655 x 3725px  \n13,8MB\n\nArtists: Oliver Reinis and Shirley Reinis",
