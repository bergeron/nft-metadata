    "description": "Immerse yourself in a world of endless creative possibilities. From world renowned musician and producer AbJo, the AbJonian Vault Selections Kit gives you an all access pass into his \"private vault\" of sounds.\n\nAbJo is well known for his signature textures, chord progressions, and live string instruments which he plays himself. From his signature synths and futuristically jazzy chords, these sounds can be chopped, processed, and stacked to tell your story.\n\nAbJonian Vault Selections is a truly unique Kit with 60+ stems that champions alluring arrangements and glorious layers of sounds. Allow AbJo's collection of classically inspired riffs to return you to why you began making music in the first place.  \n  \nSamples included in this Kit:  \n - AVS_GRS_Grand Rising  \n - AVS_DCE_Decadence  \n - AVS_MJB_Mary J Bop  \n - AVS_STB_SecureTheBag  \n - AVS_OTR_Outro Vibes  \n - AVS_ARP_ArpGang  \n - AVS_OMG_Omega  \n - AVS_SN613_Symphony-No-613  \n - AVS_ASIG_And So It Goes_Bm_78BPM  \n - AVS_STA_Sonata  \n - AVS_SYB_Symp Bump  \n - AVS_Three  \n"
