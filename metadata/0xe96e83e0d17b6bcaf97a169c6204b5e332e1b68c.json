    "description": "What's a (natural) number? What does it look like?\n\nWe represent numbers with symbols like 1, 2, 3, I, II, III. We are aware of objects that have a numeric property: A square has 4 sides.\n\nBut, what about the number itself? What is it? What does it look like?\n\nIn 1923, John von Neumann proposed a set-theoretic construction of natural numbers: We can start with the empty set, and then define the next number as the set containing all previous numbers:\n\n0 = {}  \n1 = { {} }  \n2 = {0, 1} = { {}, {{}} },  \n3 = {0, 1, 2} = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} } }  \nAnd so on.\n\n\"Number 10, Red\", is inspired by von Neumann's construction. Each closed shape is a set.",
