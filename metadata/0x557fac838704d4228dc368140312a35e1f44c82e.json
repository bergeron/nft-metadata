    "description": "The design of ‘True Colours’ is inspired by the revolutionary cubism art movement.\n\nAs we peel the layers back on this character, their appearance changes. What if we do the same to you? Are you proud of what’s beneath? \n\nThis piece was drawn traditionally, detailed and coloured in Procreate, variations done in Photoshop, and then finally animated in After Effects.\n",
