To make matters worse, I spawned with my back turned away from the waves, which were the main attraction advertised in the specifications.\n\nIf I had to find something positive about the experience, it would be the never-ending soda in my hand. However, I must say, no amount of soda can prevent you from losing your sanity while enduring the agonizing 35 years it took for the simulation to conclude.\n\nAI & Digital Painting"
