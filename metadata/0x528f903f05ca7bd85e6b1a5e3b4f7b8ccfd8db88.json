    "description": "Nature as the main source of inspiration. Bright, beautiful, juicy, unique. Our crude collective imagination interprets our thoughts, into a crystal-clear idea created from what we have seen around us. But sight is but one source of the senses. There is something else. The elusive, the beautiful. The artist's attempts to recreate that, to bring something beautiful into this world. But why? Why does he keep doing it?",
