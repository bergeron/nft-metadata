    "description": "Took this magnificent photo while I was on holidays. My goal was to find an unique location with a view of mt. Triglav. I left on an 1h30min drive the previous day, so I could start walking around midnight. Took me little more than 4 hours to get to the top. Clouds were changing their colour every single minute. It was so magical. Probably one of the best moments in my photography carreer. Hopefully I get to experience more moments like that. ",
