    "description": "Mo've' on is an NFT that tells the story of its beginnings how to move forward  and leave something behind.\n\nThis event was inspired by Neil Amstrong's first successful landing on the moon that was the goal of many people. However, humans did not choose to stop at just the moon, but they want to go further more.\n\nJust like our lives, even though we sometimes reach a definite destination, but we can't live with it forever.  On the other hand, it might just be the beginning of the next more challenging journey which is reflected in this NFT work.\n\n",
