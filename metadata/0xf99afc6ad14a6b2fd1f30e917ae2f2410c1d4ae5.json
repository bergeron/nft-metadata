    "description": "My name is \"SADMAN\" . I am a songwriter and producer from BKK, Thailand .I've been with music most of my life. And every song composing usually happens because of love.\n\nThis song is based on my real life. I started writing this song in October 2021. The lyrics refer to a woman I like. and he has taken away from me But I'm always waiting for you\n\nI hope you like it even if it's not in your language. But music is a universal language. and hope you feel it\n\nI still have many songs. and hope someone will like it And I'm sending in a lot of new songs.\n\nThanks\nSADMAN'",
