    "name": "Nammu",
    "description": "Water deities are reborn in a dream. They cross the distant Mesopotamia, the rivers of Egypt, the mythical Aegean Sea...\nThey rejoin the gold of an immobile time and, when nothing moves, caught in the nets of their ancient dreams, baptized with an aquatic light, they marry from the depths of their sleep the mist of the mountains from which one never returns.\n\n\n\nNammu was the Sumerian goddess representing the primeval waters (Engur). She gave birth to An (heaven) and Ki (earth) and to many more of the ancient gods; \nNammu was also known as “the lady of the mountains.” In many poems, she is said to have created mankind by making a clay figurine which was then brought to life.",
