    "description": "I'm thrilled to share the release of \"Lost in Paris\", my first original song on Sound.xyz. This song holds a special place in my heart as one of my earliest and proudest works.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to have received positive reception to my previous NFT collections, including the sold out 888 Love Letters, and have had the honour of sharing the stage with musical legends like Snow Patrol and Robbie Williams.\n\nThis limited edition NFT release, with only 25 available, embodies my journey of pursuing my dreams and my deep roots in my childhood city of Paris. I never could have imagined that my \"let's try this\" gap year adventure would lead me on this incredible decade-long journey, all thanks to your love and support.\n\nFor a limited time, the first 15 buyers during the 1-hour presale, open only to previous NFT holders, will have the opportunity to secure this unique digital treasure. And, one lucky NFT holder who mints the golden egg will be invited to a 3-night stay in Paris in my old neighbourhood, a chance to explore the city for themselves (subject to availability and proper notice).\n\nJoin me and the passionate Savage Degens community on 7th February at 7pm CET / 1pm ET. Don't miss this rare opportunity to own a piece of musical history.\n\nPS: Why the bear? Watch my music video on YouTube to find out. Busking for honey in the streets of Paris, the bear is a symbol of embracing life's ups and downs.",
