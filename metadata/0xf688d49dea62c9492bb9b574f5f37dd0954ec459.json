    "description": "This series was inspired by a concept in General Relativity that all motion is relative, and explores visualizing the movement of the planetary bodies through long exposures. Captured by changing the focal length during a single 5-second frame, this photo is only possible during a lunar eclipse, where the stars are close in brightness to the moon in Earth's shadow.\n\nLunar eclipse long exposure, 2019.",
