    "description": "With you, all that I am becomes a blubbering mess\nA string of disjointed sentences amidst grave stuttering\nWith you, I see love, not for the joy it brings, but how far apart it tears us\nWith you, WE was a possibility because YOU and I did not like US\nAnd US was YOU for both of US.\nFor when We touched, I became You and You, Me.
