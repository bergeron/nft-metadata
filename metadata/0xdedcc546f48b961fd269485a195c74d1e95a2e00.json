    "description": "Some clouds have silver linings, and some - lit by the glow of the setting sun - have golden ones. \n\nAs the winter sun falls behind the the towering skyscrapers of Central, Hong Kong, the light is parted by the buildings, scattering the rays into a beautiful display of light and shadow.\n\nThis image is a 1/1 edition as part of the '光 - Light' series, a collection of aerial photographs devoted to examining different kinds of light, whether natural or man-made, from the air.\n\nThis image was taken on 28th December 2020.",
