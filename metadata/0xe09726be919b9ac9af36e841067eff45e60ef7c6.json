    "description": "The first thing that you must know - I am NOT inspired by the war in MY country. If I was - you would see this art about 10 days ago...\n\nBut I AM inspired. Inspired by our men and women standing in the battlefield. By their victories and the fear they evoke in our enemy! This is not an artwork of war - this is an artwork of freedom!\n\n\"She is exhausted, she is facing something that was said to be stronger than her... Yet, she stands, not taken by the flames she was meant to burn it, but burning with her own will - will to freedom, will to life, will to what really is important.\n\nShe is walking through hell with her tired feet, yet she is looking to heaven she belongs to - the heaven she will once reach.\n\nShe is the mother of strong, she is the daughter of strong, she is the sister of caring... And she is the nemesis of her enemies.\"\n\nI am true to all the feelings put in this piece... Слава Україні!\n\nAll bidders receive a retro-photo version.\n\nA winner also receives a war poster version.",
