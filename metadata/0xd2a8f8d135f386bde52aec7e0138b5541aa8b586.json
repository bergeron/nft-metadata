    "description": "Infrared Photo\n\nThe human eye sees the range between 400-600 nanometers in the magnetic light spectrum. Infrared photography allows us to see beyond 600 nanometers. This is possible by interfering (modifying) the sensor of the camera or the infrared filters attached to the front of the lens. The reason for the photo's feeling of snow is due to the light-permeable nature of the materials. In infrared photos, the green color of the trees appears white, the sky, lakes and seas appear darker. This photo was taken with a camera modified with 720 nanometers (nm).\n\nLocation: Karacabey Longoz Forest, Bursa, Turkey\n\n4058 x 2789 px 300 dpi\nNikon D90 720 nanometre\nf/11\n1/400 sec\niso 200\n8,47 mb\n\nIt excites me to see the world that we cannot see with infrared photography. I feel like I've discovered places that are not of this world. Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming when I look at the infrared photo. That's why I love infrared photography so much. I enjoy sharing this with you too.\n",
