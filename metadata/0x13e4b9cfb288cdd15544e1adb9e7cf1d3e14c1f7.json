    "description": "The moment was perfect for capturing the light, \nWhere the camera was moving alongside the juggler's flight.\nHe opened the door of the ancient song,\nThat can only be seen when exposure is long.\n\nBy entering the realm of a spirit world\nAnd harmonic convergence that has been twirled,\nRaava and Vaatu are dancing in collision \nThat only the Avatar can balance with his vision.\n- Filip Borelli, 2021\n\nDedicated to Michael Dante DiMartino and the Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series.\n\nKinetic light painting photo - 2000 x 3000 px jpeg\nFrom A DIFFERENT KIND OF PHOTOGRAPHY COLLECTION\nCreated by Filip Borelli \n\n// THE HOLDER of this NFT will have:\n- PREMIUM RIGHT on presale of any future edition or collection on any platform.\n",
