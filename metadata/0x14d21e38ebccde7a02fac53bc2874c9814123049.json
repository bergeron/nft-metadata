    "description": "My grey cells dive into a complex process involving numerous steps that I cannot control.\n\nEvery experience of my life wires my brain into a different state of mind. Even when there's no one who wishes harm to me appears to do so and sometimes I pause to reflect back, why would they even want to think about someone in a not so beautiful way?\n\nIt takes more than courage for me to protect myself every time my imagination delves into this assumption yet all I know is that I am simply different and my existence is much more than what it appears to be.\n\nDimensions: 8135 x 7866\nFormat: Digital Art",
