    "description": "Small spaces with eternal dimensions. \"A yellow flower\" is the description of a free zone where the vocation of an artist originated. Not even he knows where the meaning of this work goes, but he does feel where it comes from.\n\nIn Chorrillos neighborhood, a child without siblings turned the tiny garden of the house where his mother worked as a housekeeper into the canvas of an eternal painting. Beetles and ants became the gods of a child's mythology in that private forest. Weeds and dandelions into leafy trees and hand-dug ponds into giant lagoons that dried up daily.\nA child holding a flower and growing with it under the sun describes what we see, but at the same time, a poem we are not allowed to understand. \n\nThis might be a thirty-nine-second summary of the artist's life, or perhaps it is simply the story of a child who continues to live in a garden that will never belong to him.\n\nDiscover more about this collection at https://jaderivera.pe/unafloramarilla/",
