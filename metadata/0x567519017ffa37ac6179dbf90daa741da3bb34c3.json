    "description": "Welcome to Eko, the most populous city in Africa and Nigeria's commercial nerve Centre.\n\nEko is the real name of Lagos where the famous Aro Meta statue erected and placed upon a high pedestal welcomes travellers into the city of Lagos. The statue portrays the image of three white cap chiefs (Yoruba: Idejo) in slightly different positions, wearing white wrappers tied across their shoulders with their right fists clenched, thus symbolizing the strong belief of the supremacy of the right hand over the left. The figure on the right-hand side stretches his fist forward to the air; with an inclined fist a bit down, the figure in the middle holds his right fist forward while the figure on the left brings his two fists together, slightly touching each other in the air.\n\nThis piece is a tribute to Bodun Shodeinde, the sculptor who through his work, has depicted the highest honour that can be accorded to anyone in the Eko greeting tradition.\n\nThis Ape derivative carries all that essence and ties it to the meterverse in a nice pun - Aro Meta - Aro Meta(verse); Meta meaning 3 in Yoruba, the predominant language spoken in Lagos.\n\nWelcome to Eko, Aro Meta says!   \n\nArtist - [Chuma Anagbado](https://foundation.app/@chuma).\n",
