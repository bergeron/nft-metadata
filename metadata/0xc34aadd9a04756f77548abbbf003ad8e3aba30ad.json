    "description": "I was lost in a crowd. Varanasi is a maze of smoky alleyways, lined with incense and dusky pink temples. As I emerge onto the banks of the Ganges, I see a hawker. Her expression lies in contrast to her garment.\n\nA pilgrim approaches her to buy some of her fragranced flowers. As the customers walks away, the hawker notices a flower has split onto the floor. She jostles through the crowd and returns it to the customer, and they exchange a smile.\n\nIn a land where corruption and dishonesty are not uncommon, there are those who still value an honest day's work.\n\nPentax P30 + SMC 50mm f/1.7, Portra 400.\nVaranasi, India.\nMarch 2018.\n",
