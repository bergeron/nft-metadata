    "description": "\nAs usual on my work I play with memories and with the contrasts of different textures in between the printed image and the brushstrokes. I feel we life in a world that sadly always is looking forward. Almost 600â€‰plant species have become extinct, and this is something that is never heard.\nI did lose dear people in my life path. I miss them. To poetically translate this feeling, I work with old botanical studies illustrations, and I dialogue through color with them to connect with all those memories from past generations. I embrace the feeling of missing the lost ones with  vibrant and colorful pieces that celebrate life as a circle.\n",
