    "description": "\"Glass Jedi\" was the first song created for my debut album, the landscape for the world I was about to build. I had a very close friend put me in the studio with Deaton Chris Anthony & Jean Dawson and this was what we created. \n\nI had written out a very detailed map of the sounds and feelings I wanted to  evoke in the project which were serious, sexy and multi dimensional. \n\nAt this point in my life I was going through huge transitions out of a super toxic relationship, so writing this was like being born again. Jean and I mostly worked ways to iterate finding an exit sign in the back of my head so the hook turned into \"In the back of my mind there's a white hearse or a limousine \" \n\nI also yell and scream words like \"salt all in my veins\" , \"black veil on my baby face\" \"all I feel is everything\" then \"in the back of my mind there's a white hearse or a limousine\" transitioning into a much smoother moment of release. \n\nThis is the world opener of the album because it's the most intoxicating and boundary pushing I felt I had been in my career yet. the collaboration couldn't have been more special to be re presented.",
