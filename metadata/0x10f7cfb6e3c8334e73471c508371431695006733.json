    "name": "Daring's embodiment : The Cheetah",
    "description": "Sometimes I feel like a cheetah. And you ?\n\nThe cheetah embodies darings, grace, power, and the pursuit of excellence. The supreme level of athleticism and adaptability. Its presence is a reminder to embrace one's unique talents, chase goals relentlessly, and harness one's inner strength to achieve remarkable feats. To summarize, I would say poetically : \n\nCheetah sprints, swift and free,\nGraceful embodiment of agility.\nSymbol of speed and daring feats,\nIn pursuit of greatness, it never retreats.\n\nYbelion.",
