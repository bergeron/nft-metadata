    "description": "Transience. It shows us how impermanent and fragile our existence is. Every beautiful moment is history within milliseconds and irretrievably lost forever. \nThe only thing that remains is the memories. \nBut we live in a world where we are exposed to so many influences and information every day, where memories fade faster and faster. Until only fragments remain.\n\nI have experienced as a human being how painful transience can be and how memories fade away if you have nothing to refresh them. \n\nThat is why it is so important to me to preserve unknown memories with my photographs and to tell them through my visual language before it is no longer possible for anyone.",
