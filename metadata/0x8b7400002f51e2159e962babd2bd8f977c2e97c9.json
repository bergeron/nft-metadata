The Demons possess Inku’s, making them The Undead. Inku’s must do what they can to take down the Demons and regain peace, hopefully finding a way to save those that have been affected by the Demons. If Inku’s are able to overcome the Demons, the Ghosts will finally be able to move onto the next realm in peace.",
