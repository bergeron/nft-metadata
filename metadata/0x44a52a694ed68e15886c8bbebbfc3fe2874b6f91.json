The same painters behind the Orientalist odalisques also painted propagandistic portrayals of France: Bonaparte triumphant on a horse crossing the Alps, Bonaparte imbued with divine authority sitting on a throne, the triumph of the French Revolution...\n\nThis series portrays teenagers and women, previously portrayed as supine odalisques, partying in Occidental villas, and on thrones that the Orientalist painters had portrayed the French rulers on",
