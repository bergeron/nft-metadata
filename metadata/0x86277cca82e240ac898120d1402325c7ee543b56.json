    "description": "The mention of fishing can bring back many episodes from your childhood, when you spent carefree time by the river and your father taught you how to fish. That time will forever remain in your memory. And it's very precious, no matter what happens. That time now reminds me of such a sunset - it's very dreary, but it will remain a bright beautiful spot in my memory.\n\n5000x6000 px",
