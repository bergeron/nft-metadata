    "description": "Some says he is God.Some says he is Evil. He can bend and change reality to his own will. No one can escape his trap, No one can distinguish what's real and what's made up by The unknown. If he is near, you must run, unnoticed... but remember be sure you're running away from him as you won't distinguish what's real and what's not.Maybe the path you're running on leads to him not away from him ! --XComet",
