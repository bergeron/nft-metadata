    "description": "Welcome to Eternal Garden.\n\nEternal Garden follows the story of Caius, an angel cast out of heaven by the goddess Flora, tasked with a mission to terraform a now desolate and uninhabitable earth. Though his mission was successful, he broke the singular rule necessary for an angel’s survival. Caius falls in love with an earthly being, later revealed to be a centuries old shapeshifter, and falls into a deep slumber. Locked in a daydream, he relives the memories of a thousand men, unlocking the secrets of the human condition as he experiences love, heartbreak, and resentment over and over again. He awakens to a world on fire and stripped of his angelic blessing. To reclaim his power and fulfill his promise, Caius embarks on a treacherous journey to the Eternal Garden - a portal between Heaven and Earth, and the source of their vitality. \n\n7 Songs, 7 Visuals, 7 Forbidden Fruits, 700 Editions.\n\nRead more at: www.eternal-garden.xyz\n\nEternal Garden was written, produced, and performed by TK. Featuring additional production by Aidan Graven & Brett White, and additional vocals by Refi.\n\nArtwork: Karey & TK\nProject Management: ladidai",
