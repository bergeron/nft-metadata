    "description": "Setubunsou is a Japanese endemic flower that blooms west of Kanto area in Japan.\nThis setsubunsou woke up today in the lingering snow and in the early spring, looking around a little, setsubunsou himself says that spring has come,\nWhile looking around, I feel like setsubunsou is confirming that it's okay to wake up.\nA true spring awakening.\nA little bewildered, but also thrilled with joy, he seemed to whistle involuntarily and say hello to his friends.\nIn Japan, there is something called \"setsu\" as a turning point for each season, and Setsubun is an important time that represents the first turning point.",
