    "description": "I've always been fascinated by slime mold, and its unique characteristics have inspired me to create this piece. What makes this organism so special is its incredible ability to recall memories of past experiences and utilize them when making decisions. \nI used CGI to create a calming and relaxing 3D sequence that showcases the fascinating fractal patterns of this organism. I hope that this artwork spark curiosity and wonder, and perhaps even inspire you to learn more about the natural world. "
