    "description": "PLACES TO VISIT (PTV)\n\nThe idea of this collection is heavily based on what I feel and think. As always people often sacrifice travel and time with ourselves in favor of our careers. 80% of the citizens of my country do not have a passport at all and have never traveled anywhere, sometimes even from their own city. We donâ€™t have to blame ourselves, we just need to dream about visiting and expanding our view borders.\n\nThis collection was made to be a kind of reminder of how important it is not to deny yourself the pleasure of exploring the world and our beautiful planet. To be a kind of trigger or medium, to look at or possess, and to be carried away in one's imagination for a moment.\n\n1000x1000\n1 card 1 copy\n\n[PTV full info](http://www.ptvnft.com/)",
