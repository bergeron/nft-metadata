    "description": "Clarity is a consequence,\nof surrendering to a higher will.\nFaith is the prerequisite for moving forward,\ntrusting, above all, in yourself.\n\nIn the very will of your heart,\nthat allows you to navigate the waters.\nWhen they become dark,\nand the present is flooded with tireless time.\n\nWith a doubt that lurks,\nbringing with it the valuable information.\nThat if you hesitate it is because you care,\nyou just have to learn to read.\n\nWhat is hidden between the lines,\nlike the engine that will allow you to move forward.\nFollowing that invisible force,\nthat illuminates the path of your dreams.\n\nSantiago, 27 December 2022",
