    "description": "Everything we experience turns into 'memory' through 'Memory machine' in our head. This machine is like a small factory. The process of this factory is as follows.\n\nWhen everything we experience (this is a ball form, and each has a different color) enters the machine, it passes through four places.\n\n1) Manager Room: Turn on all devices in the factory.\n2) Memory Photo Studio: It brings all experiences in one place and change them as images or videos. It becomes a 'memory' now!\n3) Memory Files: Those files from 'Memory Photo Studio' are classified and stored according to timeline or subjects.\n4) Memory Editing Room: Edit memories (sometimes distortion) and save them.\n\nThrough all these processes, some experiences are gone, some experiences remain, and some experiences remain in a distorted state.\n\n* This video shows inside of a 'Memory Photo Studio'. One day, I saw a red sunrise over the sky. Now it becomes a 'memory'! \n\n1920 * 1080px",
