    "description": "Despite the fact that Alice has an ordinary-sized head in life, apple lips are not nailed, eyelashes are not made of wires, and wild moss does not grow in her mouth, her alter ego drops in for a visit every couple of months.\n⠀\nHer condition right now is due to the deadly and eternal need for creative search and balancing between Mars and Earth. All this sometimes makes her limp and answer the question “How are you?” \n⠀\n- Like everyone else. Indefinite, prone to fading, but with an unshakable faith in the best.",
