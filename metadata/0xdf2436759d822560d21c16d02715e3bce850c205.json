    "description": "「彼女は海と砂浜の隙間から出てきた（！）\nそれなのに髪も肌も濡れてなくて、唯一スカートだけが濡れていた…と言うより、スカートは波と一体化して揺れていた。人間なのか、人魚なのか、はたまた海そのものなのか。僕はただそこで腰を抜かして、彼女から目を逸らすことすらできなかった。」\n\n“She came out of the gap between the ocean and the beach (!).\nAnd yet her hair and skin were not wet, only her skirt was wet...or rather, her skirt was swaying in unison with the waves. Was she a human being, a mermaid, or the ocean itself? I just sat there and couldn't even look away from her.”\n\n----------\n\nI brought my new work \"moments like your fake\" to FND for my first NFT in a month and a half.\nAlthough there have been changes in my environment and state of mind during that time, I still love to paint pictures in any way I can, and I can't stop, and these days made me realize once again that I started NFT as a resolve to do so.\nI painted this work with this in mind and made it my first NFT for FND.\nI really wanted to finish this new work in time for the summer, but my goal is to keep my own pace and not overdo it...\n\nThanks for finding it!",
