    "description": "They watch the stars fall. \nBright lights streak through the night sky, \nthen disappear - dust.\n\nStargazers is my love story with the night sky.  Growing up in the mountains with the milky way right outside my front door brought me peace even in stressful times.  Though I took it for granted. Once I moved to a city, I lost that connection for over a decade.  \n\nI felt something was pulling me back to it.  Like part of me was missing, I couldn't stop searching.  Until I found it again but this time with my wife by my side.  Now I get to enjoy the night sky with her, connecting, witnessing in awe and wonder.   Feeling inspired.",
