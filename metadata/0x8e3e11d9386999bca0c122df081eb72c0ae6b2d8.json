    "description": "For this piece, I set up my canvas and paint pens at a local music and art event, and had random passerby’s add whatever they felt to the canvas. Then I taped over the contributions I wanted to remain, and began painting. \n.\nThis method brings a more intimate and inviting atmosphere because everyone gets to feel invested in the piece, they’re all a part of it. Not to mention how fun it is to see their drawings preserved in the final piece, I love it. A collab with a whole party. \n.\n#LeoAschArt #LeoAsch #LeoAschPhoenix #AutomatismSurrealism #AutoSurreal #Automaticwriting #energy #subconscious #Surreal #Multimedia #Cryptoart #Digitalrenaissance #dismyshit-enjoy",
