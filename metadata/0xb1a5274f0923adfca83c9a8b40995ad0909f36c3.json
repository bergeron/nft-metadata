    "description": "Higanbana is a flower from China that thrives in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan.\n\nRed and beautiful, that's what flowers from the amaryllis family look like. But, don't be fooled by its beautiful shape because Higanbana has a deep meaning and makes the hairs stand on end\n\nIn addition to meaning death, Higanbana is also believed to be a farewell flower. When Japanese people part with someone or meet someone for the last time, Higanbana will bloom all the way.",
