    "description": "I slept, and in my dream,  \nI saw a dark and eerie place where no light shined,  \nA place shadows lurked and whispered low,  \nAnd every step I took was met with woe.\n\nBut then I saw a glimmer in the dark,  \nA faint and distant spark, seemed like light,  \nAnd as I moved closer, it grew brighter,  \nA glimmer of hope in the deathly night.\n\nAnd then I knew I'd make it through,  \nThat I would wield the light and start anew,  \nFor even in the darkest depths of hell,  \nThere's always a way to break the spell.",
