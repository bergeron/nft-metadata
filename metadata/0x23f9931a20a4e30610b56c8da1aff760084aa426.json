It's the only thing that can still bring the sparkle back to your eyes.\nThis night is not over.\n\n*This is a fake commercial*\n\nA TV commercial airing on an old CRT somewhere in the future world.\nI like wild and chaotic images like this one.\nBut at some point, they stopped making them.\nI'm going to create a video with the atmosphere of a bygone era that will color the meta-space. This is just the beginning.\nWe make cyberpunk video works like this one.\n\nProceeds from this collection go towards the development of the feature.\nAlso owners will be credited in the film.\n\nDirected, photography, edited, kitsunetsuki.jp\nCast, BADASS âˆ‡ DELTA, ReiLa and CYBERPUNKERs",
