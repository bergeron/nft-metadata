    "description": "We are Lucky Card Company.\n\nOur Mission is to create an NFT with the utility of airdropping large amounts of crypto every other week to a few of our holders.\nWe will do this by putting 50% of revenue from the Lucky Card NFT sale into the community wallet. From there we will stake it in Olympus coin ($OHM) or another DeFi coin and every two weeks we will pull the interest we have earned out and give it away to 3 of our Lucky Cardholders via live drawing!\n",
