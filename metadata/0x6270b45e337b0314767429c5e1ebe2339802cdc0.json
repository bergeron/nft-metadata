    "description": "This is a test image from the early days of light painting with robots, shot from a friend's balcony in downtown Los Angeles. I was trying out all kinds of things because I had not yet mastered my own technique. \n\nThis image is not repeated in the form of a time-lapse because I used to compose by programming the robots in the field while shooting on location, a wildly impractical way to create art in this fashion. \n\nIt took ten years to master the techniques needed to light paint with motion control robots, but there were many beautiful experiments along the way like this one.",
