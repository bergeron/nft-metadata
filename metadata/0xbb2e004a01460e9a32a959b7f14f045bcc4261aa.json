    "description": "Eric Peters operates one of the largest institutional crypto hedge funds in the world. What do the institutions think of our little crypto asset class? Are they running for the hills?\n\nEric Peters is the Founder, CIO of One River Asset Management. His fund has made some of the largest institutional investments in crypto ever..including one purchase of over $600 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. When we think institutional crypto, we think Eric Peters.\n\nHis first appearance on Bankless was in October 2021…we brought him back to catch us up on the current institutional thesis for crypto.\n\n10% of proceeds donated to the Connecticut Foodshare, an organization delivering an informed and equitable response to hunger.",
