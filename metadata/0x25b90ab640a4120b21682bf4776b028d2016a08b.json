    "description": "Huefowls are an endemic species of the Hueverse that look like chubby peafowls. The Najas adopted them as pets because of their various and interesting personalities. Mehen chose to send a few individuals from the Hueverse to the Metaverse to test the stability of the portal he opened. Funnily enough, they're hexagon shaped when they do the cartwheel which would favor their social relationship.",
