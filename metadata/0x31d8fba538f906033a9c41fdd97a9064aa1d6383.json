    "description": "Name: Esra the Path of Night\n\nShort Bio: \n\n     A higher being of Magic and probably one of the oldest as well, it is believed that Esra knows all of magic at its core. Every spell, no matter how complicated, can be broken down into basic fundamental Laws. \n\n     Esra prefers to be discreet, involving herself as little as possible in mortal affairs, however,  she particularly invites Witches of all affiliations learn what she knows. Though she almost she never makes a direct appearances, she spreads pieces of her knowledge amongst stars and lets those who walk her path decipher them for their own growth and purpose.\n\n\n",
