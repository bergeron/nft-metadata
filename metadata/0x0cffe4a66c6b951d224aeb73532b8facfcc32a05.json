    "description": "Perception is part of the Mire series.\n\nMire is a collection of 8 digital portraits created in episodes of hypomania and depression over the course of 6 months in 2013 and 2014. Hypomania and depression are mental states common to bipolar disorder and can have devastating effects on those involved.\n\nI am no longer burdened by the extremities of the disease thanks to the well known medicine (the alkali metal) Lithium. \n\nA mire can get you stuck for a long time, getting unstuck is a matter of getting the right help from the right people. \n\nThese works could easily symbolize the terror of mental illness that shadowed their creation; instead, I happily present them as symbols of optimism and hope.
