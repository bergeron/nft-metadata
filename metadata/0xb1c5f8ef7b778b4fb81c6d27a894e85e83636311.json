    "description": "I have been extremely lucky to have some of the most beautiful souls enter into my life.\n\nThey have given me love and support far beyond what I deserve\n\nWithout these friends I think my spirit would have been crushed under the weight of life's challenges. I'm not sure I'd be here today without them.\n\nThis piece is about being saved by the love of a friend, one soul emerging out of a safe cocoon through the support of a higher being \n\nLooking up at the night sky has always brought me comfort, even as a child I'd spend many hours just stargazing.\n\nSo it's quite fitting that the person that really saved me in my darkest moments has a starlike energy, I designed the higher being with that in mind\n\nThank you for letting me share my story with you!",
