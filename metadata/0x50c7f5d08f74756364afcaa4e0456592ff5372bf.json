    "description": "She ran away. Escaped from her past and her present... \nToday there is only this day. Explosive, bright, colorful. Flowing like lava from a volcano, glowing with unreal warm colors. \nShe is so full of energy that it lights up everything and everyone. \n\nAt her feet you want to stay forever. \nJust to be near her. Not with her. \nAnd at the same time to bask in the rays of her energy waves. \n\nShe's here... \nShe's here for the long haul... \nShe's here for an eternity...",
