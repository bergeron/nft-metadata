    "description": "About the collection:\nArchitecture ob-scure is what I consider one of the earliest attempts to explore the missing relationship between art and architecture using the novel Ai tool, which has been neglected for far too long as modern architecture, in particular, has often been stripped of its artistic aspects, becoming more about functionality and efficiency than beauty and design. This collection is one of the earliest attempts to reclaim the artistic aspect of architecture and bring it back to the forefront.\n\nTitle: Bathroom Madness \nShaping interiors through camera movements to create unprecedented spatial relationships.\n\nInfo:\nDuration: 00:33:10.\nResolution: 1080x1920 29.97 FPS\nTools: Stable diffusion / Adobe Premier",
