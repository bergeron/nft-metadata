    "description": "Before the set, and after the rise.\n\nI will meet you there. To share our stories staring at the sunset. You look beautiful, your sight is lost to the horizon while telling your truth, and the caressing light of the golden hour saturates your thoughts.\nThen just silence, the breeze and the waves, the nature sound of wisdom.\n \n\n  \nThis piece, is a progression of latent light like states, representing the magical hours where thoughts saturates with light.\n\nThis piece is part of the Latent Natures Collection. \nA Collection of Human natured machine visions. Based off more than 15.000 2-3d ‘handmade’ digital composites, created and curated by the Artist. Pseudo-random abstraction datasets were then generated to train and modulate an AI model till a singularity state of latent progressions.\n\n32sec | Loop | 2160x2700 | 30fps | Mp4 \n",
