    "description": "It was my first Solo trip and starts my journey from 'Pondicherry' ( A city in India)\nI ride straight to white Town on a rented bike.\nWhile I was capturing those europian colored walls of Pondicherry , my eyes stopped wandering the streets and got stuck on this beautiful people.\nLively loving mother and a kid, both having the same short bob hair style.\n\nBoth held an aura of love with them. \nKid got some extra activeness with him,so lively to watch him.\nKid persists to have Ice bar from the streets and mother surrendered to his wish and bought each for them.\nKid's face brightened and shine with joy.\nTwo happy soul walks towards me, having Ice bars in their hands \nThe happiness and joy they had with them is a glimpse to eyes.\nHow someone could lose such a frame of authentic emotions, happiness for little things in life.\nHow little things makes people happy is all in this.\nThere I captured this frame,handful of love for Ice Bars",
