    "description": "The \"Solarized\" collection perfectly encapsulates the style of Modern Vintage Photography. A vintage process, used extensively by some great historic photographers such as Man Ray, is brought into the 21st century by MVP.\n\nSolarization renders part of a photographic image negative and part positive by exposing a print or negative to a flash of light during development.\n\nThis process of digital solarization was created by Modern Vintage Photography to perfectly mimic the effects that can be created in the darkroom.\n\nDate Taken - 3rd June 2021  \nNFT Edition - 33/33\n\nLicense - Both print and NFT can be displayed privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants. The license includes unlimited use and display in virtual or physical galleries, documentaries, and essays by the NFT holder.
