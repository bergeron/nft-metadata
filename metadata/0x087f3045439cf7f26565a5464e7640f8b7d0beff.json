    "description": "Every person has a place, an environment where they feel in their element. For me, that place is my desk. Whether it’s after I wake up and brew my coffee, or after coming home from a long day, I can’t wait to just sit down at my desk and create.\n\nSome spaces serve a specific purpose while others are a bit more elusive. It all comes down to the question: “What inspires you? What thing, no matter how simple or grand, gives you comfort?”. These things vary from one person to another, and can appear during different stages of one’s life. \n\nJust as a house can be built but a home has to be created, some things take more time to come to fruition.  It doesn’t mean that they’re not there. There’s always something, and you're more than free to share it with others if you’d like.\n\nWhat gives you comfort? When does a space make you feel you belong?",
