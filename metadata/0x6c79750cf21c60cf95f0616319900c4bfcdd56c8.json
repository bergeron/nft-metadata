    "description": "\nMy fear is that if I'm not with the light I'll be overcome by darkness. \nThat if I let go of my lifejacket I'll definitely drown. \nMy fear is that if I don't do enough or meet people's expectations I will lose my selfworth. \nBut here's what I'm going to do, I'll let go of all these fears because they are like the Ojùjú kalaba that never existed.  They are the tales made up by the worries of the aged to instigate fear in my little heart and They only belong to the tales... Will I believe in this fairytales or will I let go of the myth and embrace my journey with confidence?",
