    "description": "With your eyes, wakes up your soul and consciousness, as you gather everything about your surrounding, prepare to make the best of the day, take a pause and smell the light.\n\nIn every breath, smell of gratitude,\nIn every action, smell of kindness,\nIn every effort, smell of affirmations.\nIn every achievement, smell of joy.\n\nThe beauty of nature is to gift you with signs and hints that you can turn into miracles.\n\nSo today, I ask you, what are you affirming today?\nWhat is the miracle you wish to see today?\n\nAnswer this to yourself and bring it to life.\nEverything else is a myth.\n\nYour truth is rare.\nYour life is precious.\nYour beliefs matter.\n\nHere's to smelling the light, creating our own divine and spreading the brightest energy back into the Universe.\n\n\n\nDimensions: 3456 × 4608\nLocation: Srinagar, India",
