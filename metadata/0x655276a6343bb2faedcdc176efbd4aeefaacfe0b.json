    "description": "Love is a singular moment where I truly felt connected to my subject, and the surrounding scene. The birds kept coming up to their fallen fellow, circling around it as if they felt they could still do something, and it happened that I was in the habit at the time of photographing dead birds as part of an ongoing series through art and photography to give them life again. As I knelt down to capture the scene, this young girl in pink, in love, and in shock, came into the frame to bring me too into the image.\n\nSamsung Galaxy 5  \n2448x2448",
