    "description": "Haze by JVDE / Janus van den Eijnden\n\nIn this series, van den Eijnden explores the concept of reality in images, and considers the ways in which AI technology can blur the lines between what is real and what is not. The series invites viewers to think about the implications of this technology and ask themselves: does it matter if an image is authentic or fabricated, and how can we distinguish between the two?\n\nArtwork created for the MAIF DeepFake event 03.03.2023 curated by ClownVamp and Exhibited in the Superchief Gallery LA.\n\nPNG 4000 x 4000 .
