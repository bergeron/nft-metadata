    "description": "Hand crafted oil paintings based on the Ethereum blockchain. All arts are created in photoshop using a unique process of layers, blending, actions, and scripts. Each art piece is cc0 if you own the NFT you own the art. This is my first NFT collection if you want more I will continue to make them if not this will be my last one. Thank you for minting!",
