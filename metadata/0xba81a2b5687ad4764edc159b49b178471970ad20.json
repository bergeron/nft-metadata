    "name": "Elia - Prince of wild Sea",
    "description": "Skilled hunter, he comes out of his shelter during storms or raging sea storms. Terror of fishing boats, which he attacks to feed on their catch. There are very few sailors who have crossed paths with him, and were lucky enough to return to land.\n\n-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-\n\nEntirely handmade sculpture, placed on a real aquarium stone. Elia is a dragon inspired by the coasts of southern Sardinia, in Italy, and which takes its name from Capo S.Elia, a promontory near the city of Cagliari, on which the Devil's saddle stands.\n\nThe colors of the dragon are inspired by the coastal area where I imagined that Elijah could live and hunt. The emerald of the sea, and the brown color of the rocks.\n\nJPG\n2432X2064 pixel\n4,44 MB\n\n",
