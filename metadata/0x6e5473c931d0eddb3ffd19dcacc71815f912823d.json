    "description": "When Salvador Dali fell asleep, whom did he dream of? The person Salvador dreamed of was hidden in the middle of his painting. There are three clocks that were softened found in the painting. Can you find them? Key selection in the background is taken from the habit of Salvador Dali . He believed that his dreams were the source of his ideas. He had an interesting trick to take advantage of this. Sat on a chair with a heavy key on his hand, trying to fall asleep. When he fell asleep, his hand that holds the key became weak and fell to the ground. Dali opened his eyes and dreamed in front of his eyes for a moment",
