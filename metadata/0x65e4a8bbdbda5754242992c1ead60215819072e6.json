    "description": "This piece is part of FREQ's sold-out concrete street art collection and draws inspiration from political and historical events. It references France's gift of the Statue of Liberty to the United States as a symbol of friendship following their successful collaboration during the American Revolution. However, the artwork also explores the potential implications of this gift as a political maneuver rather than a genuine act of goodwill. Through this piece, FREQ invites viewers to reflect on the complex relationships between nations and the ways in which symbolism can be used for political gain. This is the first ever FREQ NFT as a premium 3D digital artwork. Holders can view the NFT in Augmented Reality. Purchase of this Artist Proof Edition unlocks a physical 18x24in Hahnem√ºhle Bamboo limited print made from 90% bamboo fibres. Soft surface texture and impressive print quality gives the artwork outstanding expression and soul. Edition: 1 of 13",
