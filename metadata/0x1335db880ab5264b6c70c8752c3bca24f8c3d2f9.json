    "description": "Matilda had a big grudge in her heart. She always thought about the sadness and bad events of the past. She always sat in a corner of the room and cried, life was very difficult for her, she did not have a good life since she was a child.\nOne night, when she took refuge in her small room from her stepfather and was crying, suddenly two snakes grew out of her body and wiped Matilda's tears and covered her eyes.\nAfter that, Matilda couldn't see it anymore and she was happy about it. She didn't see her stepfather anymore, she didn't see the badness and ugliness of her life. Matilda thought to herself that in this world full of ugliness and sadness, being blind is the best gift to endure her life.",
