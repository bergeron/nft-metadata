Nebula is another girl who's been exposed to frequencies coming from another dimension, giving her uncontrollable ESPER powers. As many of her contemporaries she was captured by the government and subjected to a series of scientific studies, aimed at understanding if the supernatural powers she gained could come at hand for military purposes. In her specific case, scientists focused on analyzing her dreams connecting her to L.I.N.D.A., a dreamlike reality simulation machine. Through the supernatural energy generated by her lucid dreaming, Nebula can alter reality.",
