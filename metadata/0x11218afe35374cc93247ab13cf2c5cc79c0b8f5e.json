    "description": "This photo was taken by accident at Museum of Art History in Vienna, Austria, in September 2021 when artist put very last brush stroke on her reproduction of ‘The Peasant Wedding’ (1567) of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. \n\nIn just a few seconds she will finish her work, which she painted every day for several months, as she told me later. And I, a casual visitor, accidentally caught this moment, without even imagining it.",
