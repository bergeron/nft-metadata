    "description": "In this age where countless images are being produced to understand or deceive people. Rather, these days to me, there is a lot of interest in surrealism, which was studied by previous artists. When I saw the work of Wolfgang Lettl, I could feel a sense of freedom that I couldn't understand.\nWhat is expression and what is understanding? I cast my mind that only expression has value when understood. Now, I hope that my expression achieves the function of communication rather than concrete understanding. I want to be an interesting subject that can communicate by finding the right answer without an answer through each interpretation. This series uses domestic and foreign issues as a motif and somewhat indirectly expresses it. I keep my thoughts on the problems I had at the time. I record it as an image and put it out, but I don't want it to be easily guessed. I want make image that to be remembered rather than consumed.",
