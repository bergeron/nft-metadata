    "description": "Following on mythical and metaphorical themes of waves symbolised by white horses, this work represents the sea, driven by weather, encountering a special stretch of shoreline. For a surfer, riding a cyclone swell at Noosa Heads is a coveted experience. Passionate observers also gravitate to this World Surfing Reserve to appreciate the convergence of nature’s forces and the quality of ‘horsepower’ delivered by the ocean.",
