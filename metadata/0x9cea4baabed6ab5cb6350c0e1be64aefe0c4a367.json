    "description": "1st piece of the \"Connection\" collection.\n\n\"Connection\" is a collection of portraits created from collages and the animation of inks into liquids. If you look closely at the work, you can see the movements of the ink blending into those of the face, like a subliminal network or the sap of a living organism. One can see the universal connection of the human being to the universe, but one can also see a humanity trapped in the web of a hallucinatory and hypnotic liquid post-reality, in an alternative disembodied virtual world.\n\n[ MP4 Looped video, 1500x1500, 18 seconds ///  Video & sound created by Philippe Soli√®s, minted 1/1 on Foundation in January 2022 ]\n",
