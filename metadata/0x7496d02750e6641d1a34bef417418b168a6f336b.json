    "description": "I am Japanese. In Japan, there is still a culture of stamps using ivory. Until recently I didn't even know that elephants were poached. As I was studying English, I learned from overseas news that elephants were pitiful. All I can do is tell Japan that such a tragic event is happening. I don't have the money or the talent for painting, but I painted hard. If someone buys my NFT, I'll help the elephant. For more information, please visit our website",
