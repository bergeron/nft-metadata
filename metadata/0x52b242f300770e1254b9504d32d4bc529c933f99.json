    "description": "An elderly woman approaches the end of what was a difficult life. Her face is weathered by the elements and her body is tired from a lifetime of hard work. \n\nIn that darkest of hours, a divine light begins to penetrate the darkness and irradiate through her being. This all seems so familiar to her; it's almost as though she has been to this place before, or perhaps this is where she was before her life began. Suddenly, a calm energy envelopes her being and fills her with warm light. Her Nature is Infinite and this is her Epiphany. Her fear of death and the unknown is washed away in the Golden Loving Light of the Infinite One. \n\nThis piece serves to remind its holder that this physical existence is not all that exists. There is no reason to be afraid. We are Protected. We are Love. ",
