His work has been exhibited in various shows internationally including at Saatchi Gallery, London, UK (2018); Colette, Paris, France (2016); Spring Projects, London, UK (2014); and LaMaMa Galleria, New York, USA (2011). Most recently, one of James’s clown paintings was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London as part of the 2018 Summer Show. In 2015, Joyce exhibited a video installation at Banksy’s ‘Dismaland’ exhibition in Weston-Super-Mare alongside other international artists, including Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer. Born in Wolverhampton, England, Joyce studied at Walsall College of Art and Kingston University.\n\nThis is a unique work.\n\nhttps://jamesjoyce.co.uk/",
