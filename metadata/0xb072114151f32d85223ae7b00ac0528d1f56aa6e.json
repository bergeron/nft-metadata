    "description": "Hailing from Daytona Beach, Rosso is an artistic Chubbicorn. They always wear their moustache as a special symbol for their hero, Emiliano Zapata. Ever since Rosso was first adopted, they've had a rare and powerful ability to create 'alla prima'. Maybe one day it'll help them finally achieve their lifelong dream of living the illusion. If you see them around the stable, say hi! But whatever you do—don't be abstract — they can't stand it.",
