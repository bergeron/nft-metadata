    "description": "'Low Light' is an intimate song written, recorded and performed by Emma Miller whilst living at her family home in the northeast of Scotland. Released onto streaming in 2020, this track was part of her critically acclaimed debut EP, with features in Wonderland Magazine, Clash and national radio play from BBC radio Scotland. Having never been released as a single, taking this song to web 3 as a Music NFT gives 20 collectors the chance to own a very special piece of Emma's catalogue.",
