    "description": "“METAMORPHOSIS” \nNo other than the simple circle of life.\n\nA photographic serie of elements in a real state of decomposition that seeks to manifest THAT specific instance of energy transmutation where the death of a living organism gives birth of a new one.\n\nThere are no endings without new beginnings.  As in life, everything transforms again and again in an endless spiral.\n\n“Where one world dies, another is born.” \n\nJoin the spiral!",
