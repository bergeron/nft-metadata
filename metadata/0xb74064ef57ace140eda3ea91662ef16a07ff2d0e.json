    "description": "In the technocratic era, a small group of outsiders protect the last remnants of freedom by making the best use of technology\n\nJoaquín Rodríguez is a graphic artist living in Madrid. On his works he investigates texture and shape and applies it to different types of figures, focusing his interest on achieving cohesive compositions and contrasted volumes. He uses ballpoint pen as his primary tool. Geometric abstraction and references to tech elements relate to dystopic visions influenced by cyberpunk culture and the reflection about tecnology role in human life.",
