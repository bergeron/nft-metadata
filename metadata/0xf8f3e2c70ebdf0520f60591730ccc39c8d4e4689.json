    "description": "This Genesis piece is a homage to Claire Silver and her recent season of change by up and moving 2500 miles to Berkely for her new residency.\n\nThe symbolism of this piece is Claire getting too big for and turning her back on what was previously attempting to hold her down and back health wise, this health issue... which is now in remission. \n\nClaire is, imo a pioneer and trailblazer in AI Art. She is an encouragement and great example to us all.  If she can overcome her personal obstacles and become a successful person who brightens the path for many to follow, then so can every one of us. who also have our own obstacles to overcome in life. \n\n\n\n",
