    "description": "Street cobblers are informal workers very common in west African cities. \nThese itinerant shoemakers, though cheap workers, are masters of their craft and manage with very small equipment to mend, repair and polish worn-out shoes. \nThey crisscross through neighborhoods, sometimes under harsh weather conditions, offering their services to inhabitants and earning just enough to fulfill their daily needs.  \n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nLife is a reality to be experienced.  \nThough many realities seem \"unfair\"  \nEvery reality requires the same virtue.  \nCourage.",
