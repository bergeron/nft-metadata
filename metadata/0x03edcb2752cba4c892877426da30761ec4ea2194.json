    "description": "On the last day of my spontaneous Alaska trip, I decided to book a guided tour to the Matanuska Glacier. It's not often you get an opportunity to hike an iceberg!\n\nBelow freezing temperatures. Coupled with jaw-dropping views from every angle. \n\nChilly, windy, and majestic. I felt the ice age remnant and its winter breeze pass through my whole body. Make the trek here if you ever find yourself in Anchorage, it's worth it.\n\nCollector will receive a glass print of this otherworldly moment.",
