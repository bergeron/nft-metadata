    "description": "The analogue original for this NFT artwork was made by me using the historical photographic process of cyanotype and pure gold leaf on fine handmade paper. For this purpose, I applied this photographic process freely, similar to a photochemical painting. The image was exposed in the summer evening sun, followed by rinsing and fixing with water. After drying, I applied the gold ground and the pure gold leaf.\nFor the digital processing I resorted to the possibility of alienating an image kaleidoscopically. This preserves the original character and yet creates something new.\nI would be happy if the pictures and videos in this collection inspire many people and enrich their lives.",
