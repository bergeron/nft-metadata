    "description": "An eye look in awe at a dazzling, ardent and striking fire scene. Started with a circle, the minimalist symbol of an eye, then worked my way to play around with styles, shapes and colors, to evoke the eye that reflects what it is witnessing.\n\nI love watching the wood while burning in a fire pit, since it is both dazzling and soothing, and it can make you dream and reflect at the same time. It also creates a great atmosphere for story-telling among family and friends.",
