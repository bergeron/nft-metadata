    "description": "The Scepter of Xinnn is an instrument of great power given only to the ten Master Agents who form the Inner Circle of the Order of the Watcher. Named after the first Master Agent to be inducted into the Inner Circle, the Watcher created the scepter to safely house the Master Echo Key. It is made of Gahleus gold, a refined form of the yellow precious metal found only on the planet of Nibiru, which allows the scepter to absorb, withstand and amplify the vibrational force generated by the key.",
