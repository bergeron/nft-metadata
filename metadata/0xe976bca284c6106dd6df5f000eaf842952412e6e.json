    "description": "IPERSPAZIO SINGOLARE takes shape following the studies of mathematical and physical systems, especially the ones regarding the concept of relativity.\nThe geometry, expressed by the values ​​of Length, Width, Height and Time and controlled by the algorithm, changes its shape radically and continuously, distorting the concept of \"simultaneity of events\" and \"time\", making them assume negative mathematical values, impossibly explainable in reality.\nThe human mind, using a computational approach, manages to subvert absolute concepts by creating something visually that is new and impossible to achieve in reality and in the physical world.",
