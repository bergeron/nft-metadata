    "description": "Compassion Buddha is my first NFT on the blockchain and the genesis piece to The Enlightened Being Buddha Collection on OpenSea. \n\nThe Enlightened Being Buddha Collection houses digitally-remastered versions of Compassion Buddha. Each piece within the collection was inspired and conceptualized with the pure intention of bringing presence, peace, and awareness to its' owner.  \n\nCompassion Buddha is a living, breathing painting made using acrylics. Peace and serenity infused each brushstroke, and as such, these emotions were transmitted onto the canvas.\n\nIt is said that if gaze upon the Buddha, you will be struck with the divine spark of compassion. \n\nWhen you collect this artwork you will receive the digital version, and the option to acquire the physical painting will also become available to you.\n\nSee specifications below.\n\nNFT: 2062 x 2136 300 DPI \n\nPainting: 16 x 20 canvas with the artist's signature. \n\nShipping not included, and arrival time may vary based on location.\n",
