    "description": "1/1 variation edition of Polygon multi-edition \"Absent Presence\" World ArtDrop in collaboration with World of Women NFT.\n\nWhen Elise Swopes first joined Instagram in 2010, she couldn’t have imagined that she’d one day be featured on billboards, in commercials, and on mood boards at agencies across the globe. She just knew that the phone in her hand held an incredible power, one that would allow her to inspire others while showcasing her unique vision.\n\nSince then, the self-taught photographer and graphic designer has used her business savvy to spin influencer marketing on Instagram into a full-fledged career. Her ability to connect with an audience of millions by melding art with a message has opened up once-in-a-lifetime opportunities — like throwing out the first pitch at a Cubs game, or becoming a top-selling NFT artist.",
