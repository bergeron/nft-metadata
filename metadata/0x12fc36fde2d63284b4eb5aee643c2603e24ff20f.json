    "description": "\"Stepping out of the draining density on higher grounds, filling our thirsty lungs with fresh air of new beginnings & freedom - a new world where sky & earth becomes one.\"\n\nWe have been waiting for two days within the clouds at this exposed location in the Dolomitian alps with a maximum view of 10m, freezing & unsure if the peaks will show. Then suddenly the wall of clouds broke open and revealed the mountain tops while we were running around like lunatics to not mess up the few moments we had to nail the shot I've dreamed about.\n\n1/1 edition;\nlandscape photography;\nfrom Dominique Weiss;\nItalian alps;\n5000x2886px\n\nNFT incl. 1 limited edition premium gallery print for the first collector. The art piece is printed on a premium archival quality Hahnem√ºhle Fine Art Torchon paper. This paper gives the art piece a timeless & faithful radiance with 3D-effect. It comes hand signed, hologrammed & numbered with a registered Certificate Of Authenticity.",
