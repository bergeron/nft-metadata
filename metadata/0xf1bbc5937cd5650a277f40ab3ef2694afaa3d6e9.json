    "description": "WASTED POTENTIAL is a sonic embodiment & catharsis of the best & worst moments through my early 20's. All these songs started as journal entries, as spoken word & poems for my sanity. Naturally, I fell back into music as a form of therapy for myself.\nâ†“\nWe sought potential; outgrew grandma's sweaters; plotted and prevailed; found inner healing; behold ourselves as we are; dared them all to try us; aligned with the muses; lost & found ourselves; then realised what importance means. Through depression, anxiety, abuse, loneliness, imposter syndrome, alienation, self doubt, misguidance, and the rest. Self realisation, acceptance, & alignment is a powerful force. No more Wasted Potential.",
