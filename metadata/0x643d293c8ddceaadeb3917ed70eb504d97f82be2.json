    "description": "Happiness is still free; all you have to do is lie and say how you are doing fine. \nFor once, let's forget our sorrow, let's dance away our pains, let's propagate the goodness of our ancestors. This we know how to do best; glorifying them in the midst of our trial. Today is our only chance. Let's be drunk and got knocked out through the night, and in the morning, we'll continue from where we left off. This is my trial!",
