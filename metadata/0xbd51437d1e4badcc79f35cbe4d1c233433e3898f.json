    "description": "I took two separate photo of the same tree in Brookyn Bridge Park with a Nikon D750 at full resolution. I imported both photos raw into Procreate on an IPadPro and then created 12 layers of imagery for the final animation. I brought all the layers into Adobe Premiere to create an MP4. This allowed me to create this piece in the highest resolution possible. The glitch of the tree photos is created by my breath, literally, since it is only the movement caused by my breath that made one photo different from the other.  \nPlanet at Risk is a simplified rendition of the dangers we are all facing in our shared ecosystem.
