    "description": "When I saw the statues mounted on the riverbank, my eyes focused on the flow. The water was twirling and twisting, altering the current, causing beautiful shapes and patterns. None was the same, all came up in different forms. I took several photos of the same frame, and they were all unique.\n\n \n\nAt that moment I thought that no single moment in the universe was the same as another.  It is not possible to predict or know what comes next, but each and every moment brings a unique, beautiful shape and pattern that flows through us.\n\n \n\nAnd this is what makes life fascinating.",
