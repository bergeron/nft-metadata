    "description": "The Echo Gardens collection presents various digital floral compositions created using old obsolete software (1992), then spatialized in 3D from current tools.\nLike a journey through time, these spaces depict a poetics of obsolescence : flowers are born and fade over the months, and pixels stretch as if we were in a damaged machine.\nThis collection is an invitation to explore the creative potential of these obsolete digital tools by welcoming it from current means, to consider an almost timeless creation, which stands out from the conventions of « presentism ». It encourages us to look to the past, while projecting it into the future. Maintaining the past digital heritage with a view to new horizons, particularly creative ones, also means making the user more aware of his practices until now cadenced by the continuous updating of new technologies and \"real time\".",
