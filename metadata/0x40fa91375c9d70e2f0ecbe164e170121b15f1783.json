    "description": "Speechless is a series of five: red, yellow, blue, white and black. \nIt expresses what I've experienced being imprisoned by the effects of both a burn out and long COVID. It caused me to have no voice, literally as well as figuratively when others started to decide over my life. It left me speechless. The art has to tell it for me. Which is why you'll find sentences and words in the pieces when you zoom in. It speaks the words that I can't say. \n\nYellow is one of the primary colours and relates to the state of being thrown back to the utter basics. This is my journey, thank you for traveling with me.
