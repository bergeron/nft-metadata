    "description": "The Bedouin communities currently living in Israel and the West Bank were originally displaced from their ancestral lands of the Negev desert in 1948. \n\nToday, the majority of these semi-nomadic communities continue to face displacement, demolition, and forced urbanization. \n\nTheir traditional semi-nomadic lifestyle, \nwhich is closely tied to the land, \nIs gradually disappearing \nas a result.\n\n+\n\nAt 'In This Land,' we are mapping spaces, cultures, and histories that are disappearing in the real world, so they may continue to exist in the collective imaginary. \n\nWe hope to build a web3 future that is equitable, \nand emancipatory, for all.",
