    "description": "Here at home we have a wooden box where we keep screws and stuff.  \nOnce I went to get some screws and found a lipstick inside. \nI asked my wife why she kept it there and she just replied “why not?”  \nSince then I've had this idea in my head  \n \nThis painting is completely different from anything I've ever done. \nBut still I needed to do it. \nI needed to get that idea out of me. \n\nThe way the lipstick is open and, even though it is so delicate, in the midst of so many metals, it remains intact was something I wanted to highlight in this piece.\n\nI could create this idea with a photo but it would be practically impossible to leave it exactly as I conceived it in my head so I decided to create it in the form of a digital oil painting.\n\n\nProcreate info:  \nTotal strokes made: 21709  \nTracked time: 24h 24m",
