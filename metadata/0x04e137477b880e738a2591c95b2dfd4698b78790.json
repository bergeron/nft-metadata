    "description": "\"Perfect Stranger\" is the first of a street photography series which candidly captures the raw emotions of those unknown to us.  \n\nThis starting chapter is an intimate 10 piece story about the people of Melbourne, Australia. This city played home to me for a number of years, it was in these streets I was able to develop my approach to street photography. I have a deep appreciation for it & the people. \n\nPeople watching has always fascinated me, I feel it is in these small moments we can get a true glimpse into people's lives. From these moments I love to create backstories & scenarios which led them here.  \n\nLet's reconnect to the people around us,  if only for a moment.\n\nProperties:  \nArtwork: Check Please  \nArtist: Paul Campbell  \nEdition: 1/1  \nDate: 6/02/2020  \nLicense: Extended Editorial ( if further licensing is required please contact the artist)",
