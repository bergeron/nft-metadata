    "description": "This is the first real cake i ever minted and was eaten by my son and I, so it will ONLY live on the blockchain from now on. (Unlike my other nfts which are not actual cakes on the inside and i still own the physicals)\nIm very passionate about the Gm culture, i've been in the nft space for over 6 months and i never missed my gm once. It's not just engagement farming like most of the people think, it's a way to stay in touch with your frens and see how they're doing, it's a way to get to know new frens, it's a way to spread good vibes and sweetness.\nThe decoration is made in sugar paste as always, the \"coffe\" is chocolate and the inside is sponge cake with chantilly cream (my specialty).\nI made the cut of the cake, the video and the editing in my house.\ni genuinely hope that whoever gets this cake will always have a sweet Gm",
