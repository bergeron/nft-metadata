The thought of it alone can be so stressful, just being a member of a group or community that is often discriminated against because of differences in sex, age, race, tongue, choice of words, etc. NFTs space, -with my experience so far- is a community of love with one common thin binding us together, love of art. Irrespective of age, class, status, race, country and the likes; we consider one another as one. Gearing our collective efforts towards the betterment of this space.",
