In the Dimensional Forest magic and danger are found among the natural state of dimensional wilderness, where strange things occur, and strange beings live, the home of dimensional monsters.\n\nGrabos slides among his armor, in and out of his mask, holding tightly to his beautiful dimensional sword. His crows observe him, watch the land for him and his Forest. He protects the Forest from other dimensional beings who traverse the Universe seeking to discover it.",
