    "description": "Cast Away\n\nMeet 62 y/o Subhash .\n\nPiles and piles of clothes scattered around , colourful cloth around the stall to protect him from the heat & a large table covered in thick cloth . This was his stall. \n\nWith experience of 40 years , that stall was now his home . He lifted that heavy iron in his hands and got to work . \nI was fascinated! That heavy old school iron used no electricity, had no wires . It opens up on the top where you put blocks of heated coal . The thick wooden handle is used as protection.  \nI said it was fascinating, didnâ€™t I ? \n\nHis hands were strong . His veins said everything. He referred to himself as the best Iron Man around.",
