Moe writes, \"As a nation and people progress we can see the lack of progression concerning presumptions, policies, and actions. Prometheus attempts to mirror the trajectory that we as a nation of supposedly equals are on and like a good mirror we can hopefully see ourselves and correct our blemishes before it's too late.\"",
