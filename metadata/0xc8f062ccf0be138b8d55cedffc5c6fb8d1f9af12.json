    "description": "A series of photos were taken near my neighborhood in Athens, primarily of small closed shops and abandoned vehicles,. The lots of closed small local shops and abandoned vehicles  from a mere temporary situation to a permanent one creating a new urban landscape and aesthetic. This series tries to find points of interest in this newly formed urban aesthetic. Without forgetting the grim circumstances that created it",
