    "description": "The Call Of The Void #1\n\nThe first piece in a series about the void, a series about dark thoughts, how to interpret them through creating them on the physical place, made to output them rather than internalise them.\n\nThe first piece about the void series is expressed on paper with black ink. I was intimating the spiral-like calling of darkness.\n\n\"The Call Of The Void\"\n\nThe first piece in \"The Face, The Void\" Collection.\n\n4961px × 3508px\n\nThis is an original piece of art, created and expressed by artist Harry G.B. Crabtree, using black ink on cold-pressed paper.\n© 2021 Harry George Barker Crabtree",
