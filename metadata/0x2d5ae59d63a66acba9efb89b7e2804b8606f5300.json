    "description": "The concept for this piece is chaotic intermeshing of two incompatible substances. In the culinary case of emulsion, this is usually of something water-based and an oil.\n\nThis piece is inspired my both culinary experiments and microscopic explorations. The result is something that looks both yummy and fascinating: a microbial battle scene, or a kitchen mishap frozen in time.\n\nMade with Stable Diffusion and photoshop.",
