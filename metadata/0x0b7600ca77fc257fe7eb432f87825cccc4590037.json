    "description": "The first thing you see is a face. Two eyes, a nose, a mouth stretched in an impossibly wide smile, showing off rows of cracked, crumbling teeth. Next you notice the skin: an acid-colored swirling pattern that looks like it would have the consistency of liquid latex, if you could only reach through the screen and touch it. In some of these pieces, whimsically demonic creatures perch in the face's mouth and eye sockets.\n\nThe faces are gruesome, playful, and trippy. They're vaguely reminiscent of Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat-which is appropriate considering that this is a generative collection influenced by psychedelics called Psychonautz NFT.\n\nPsychonautz NFT consists of 9,999 unique works hand drawn by the artist Sander Jansen and is personally curated by Gabriel Santos. The collection features four different characters that were named by the GBLSTS team and Psychonautz community.\n\nhttps://www.psychonautznft.com",
