    "description": "This fever of cownose rays, blessed the beaches of the Hamptons, NY in Summer 2022. In the right light, they look giraffe like as the sun deflects off them like  the bottom of a pool.\n\n Cownose rays have a distinct shape with long, pointed pectoral fins or “wings” that are separated into two lobes at the front of their high-domed heads – creating the cow-nose shape. This species is a foraging predator that specializes on shelled, invertebrate prey including clams, snails, lobsters, oysters and crabs. Once cownose rays detect their prey, they flap their pectoral fins while also sucking up sediment through their mouths and out their gill slits. Eventually they draw the prey into their mouth and use their strong jaws and thick, crushing tooth plates to break open the shells.",
