    "description": "Can you still remember your teenage years? When we were young, we were evidently rebellious and innocent, curling up into dreamland where we can be what we wanna be.  However, with time elapsing, the whole world tells us that it is time for growing and being a mature person. So our childishness and innocence have to be concealed behind a mask of maturity.  Leaving the pranks and bad kids antics behind, we have to focus on our education and career, which makes us so tired and exhausted. But in Rolling kid, you can free your inner kid out and do something goofy!  In Rolling kid world, adolescence can be last, the innocence you forever!",
