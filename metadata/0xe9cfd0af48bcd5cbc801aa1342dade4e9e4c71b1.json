    "description": "\"We are the children of this new world: only selection of us with elite genetics are selected to be born and when we turn 16, our consciousness is transferred to a silicon based version of us. The transfer of consciousness to a synthetic lifeform, does it make us immortal? Do our souls transfer too? Are we still human? We hope so.\"\n\nThe Transfer seeks to ask the viewer what consciousness is and if any being that bears consciousness is alive. \n\nSonicChimes, aka Dilek Atimtay is an illustrator and tattoo artist.
