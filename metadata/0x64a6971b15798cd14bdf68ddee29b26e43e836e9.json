There you may discover 'The Fall of Icarus' by Merry-Joseph Blondel.\n\nIn this animated re-imagining of the work, the art is brought to life from a digital image captured at the Louvre museum, and we find Icarus tumbling down from a swirling sky.\n\nThe initial NFT collector will receive this 12 second video, as well as the opportunity to have a longer 60 second version.",
