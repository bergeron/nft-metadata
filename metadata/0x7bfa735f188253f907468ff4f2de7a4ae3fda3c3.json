    "description": "In 2011 Tony Stewart went from all-time great to a TRUE LEGEND, as he became the ninth driver ever to win at least 3 Cup Series championships. More remarkable, this was Smokeâ€™s first as a driver/owner - a rare feat in the sport. The dramatic championship win came down to the final race of 2011, making this #14 stock car one for the ages. Tony Stewart is the only driver in history to win a championship in both IndyCar and NASCAR.",
