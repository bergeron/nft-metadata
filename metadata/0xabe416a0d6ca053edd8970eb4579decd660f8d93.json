    "name": "Spectrum of Desire",
    "description": "When I was 4 years old white patches of skin started to replace my beautiful brown skin- leaving me confused and insecure about my place in the world (as if being a mixed-race black girl wasn’t already a heavy enough identity to navigate). At the time, the only reference I had to someone who looked like me was Michael Jackson, & although he was loved by many, he was often misunderstood & referred to as a “freak”. This set the stage for my own understanding of how I may be perceived by society.\n\nMy attraction to others has always been more than SKIN DEEP - but for me, that’s where the conversation had to start. \n\n“Don't worry, it’s not contagious.”\n\n“No it doesn’t hurt”\n\n“I’m not sure if I’m going to turn white like MJ..\nwould you still find me attractive if I do?”\n\nSo much anxiety came with this vulnerable territory never knowing if the person I desired to love, would desire me too.\n\nSkin Deep is an on-going portrait series capturing the black vitiligo skin through the lens of desire.",
