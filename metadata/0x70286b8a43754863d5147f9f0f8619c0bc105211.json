A victim of experiences we would never want any young person to experience, I visited her in school. \n\nI was very aware of the maternal instincts evoked in me for this tiny person full of so much hurt. Her eyes would water with pain and also with hopes. And she fought. \n\nShe’s now a woman. With a life. A recovered life. And I only held her hand for a small time, but I will recall those huge, wide-eyes, inquisitive and determined. \n\nA dreamer. \n\nHOPE WINS",
