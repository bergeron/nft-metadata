    "description": "Fuyuko is our youngest waitress.\nAkane chose her because it reminded her young self, obviously without horns.\n\nShe is shy but very friendly with returning customers, and she is good at taking orders and closing the restaurant.\n\nWhen Akane told her, at the interview, that she was too kawaii, she didn't know what that meant.\n\nHer Hearth under the left eye is natural.\n\nAnother great addition to our crew, she has not yet created her custom pizza to recommend to customers.",
