    "description": "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a horned woman named Adin. She was feared and respected by all who knew her, as she was a wild and powerful creature. Her father, of unknown mixed heritage, had always warned her to hide her horns, out of fear of rejection from society.",
