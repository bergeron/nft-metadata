    "description": "I took this photo around Erciyes Mountain in 2016. I needed to get pretty close and get a close-up shot with my wide-angle lens without scaring the horses. For this, I had to follow them for about two miles.  Finally, this small group that you see paused for a while and allowed me to approach them. Getting close to the wild horses and feeling them was an incredibly emotional moment.",
