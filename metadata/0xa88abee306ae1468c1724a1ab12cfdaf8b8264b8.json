The oil painted stop animation displays the mystery of the reality of nature and the nature of reality. The loop animation signifies the cycle of life, love, greed, anger, and delusion and the only three steps of things. Everything arises, exists, and ceases, nothing in the world is permanent. The expectation of things to last forever would be our fool but yet we should take delight when it lasts.\n\n",
