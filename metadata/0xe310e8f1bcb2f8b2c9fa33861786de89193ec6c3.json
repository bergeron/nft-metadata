    "description": "I remember the day I took my dad's camera in my hands. It was a big day for me because it was the first step on my own path to becoming a photographer. I wanted to use my camera to record moments and tell stories, just like he had done all his life.\n\nI didn't know where this new journey would take me, but I was excited to find out. So I started taking pictures everywhere I went, capturing all the little things I came across on my little journey.\n\nThe pictures I took that first day told the story of a young girl starting a new, exciting adventure. This journey has only just begun, and I am excited to see where this will take me on this path.",
