    "description": "52 Weeks is an exploratory long form art project that follows my art journey over the course of 1 year. Each week will have a new piece available, although the edition sizes and mechanics may change over time as the project itself evolves. Each physical work of art will be redeemable by a holders at a set date in time in the future. \n\nSomething Familiar is the genesis piece of this project and draws heavily on the concepts and techniques used in creating The Vessel, while not being bound to any rules or combinations.
