    "description": "“Ode to the Hood” is a collection of 10 Polaroids taken in 2018 around various hoods in DC. This collection consists of some of my earliest work and is a homage to the people, places, and experiences that have made me who I am. Each photo represents a deeper connection and story that I relate to growing up in the inner city. Honoring that journey and letting us be seen. I always have to show love to the hood because the people that come from it are often times the brightest, most intelligent, creative people but with a lack of resources. We are the ones needing the most inspiration because our environment lacks that. The adversities one has to face to escape is honorable and stories deserve to be told. Though I remain on this journey, I want to be seen as a representation that you can make it out. Don't ever doubt your imagination.",
