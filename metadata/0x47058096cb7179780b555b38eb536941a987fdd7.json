    "description": "A letter from the artist: \n\nI believe in art for art’s sake —\n\nIt allows you to hold onto a moment.\n\nIt allows you to embrace vulnerability.\n\n& It allows you to share a simple joy.\n\n~ The Weekly Auction by Carly Long is made up of 1/1 original art that is first handpainted IRL, then photographed to bring it here to you. The pieces here are random, spontaneous, and all special to me. Painting is my form of therapy. So I decided to do what feels natural to me: Not promise anything other than to keep creating. \n\nTo learn more about me, my art, & The Weekly Auction, visit https://bycarlylong.com/.",
