    "name": "Indra Deva",
    "description": "Indra is the guardian deity of the East. He is said to be the god of rain and thunder. Indra's iconography shows him riding a white elephant named Airavata while holding a lightning bolt known as a Vajra. As king of the devas, he is known for mastering all weapons in warfare and a great warrior who conquers the anti-gods (Asuras).\n\nIn his capacity as the warrior god, Indra takes responsibility for defeating evil entities. He also defeats innumerable human and superhuman enemies, most famously the dragon Vritra, a leader of the dasas and a demon of drought. \n\nIndra's abode exists in the capital city of Svargaloka, Amaravati. The inhabitants of this place live without sadness, pain, or fear. The gods of the elements, celestial sages, great kings, and warriors enrich Indra's court. Together they watch the Apsaras and the Gandharvas dance and sing.",
