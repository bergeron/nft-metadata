    "description": "The emergence of an unexpected beginning that became imminent with the passage of time.\nThe strokes led me to describe myself, to find myself physically and mentally in my traces on the paper.\nMonths passed and I resorted to this method again but this time to understand what was happening inside me, and in another context.\n\nThe traces began to work, to let me capture a happy or sad face depending on the case. The rhythm of life found me going through sighs without knowing why; waiting for something that might never come and looking towards nothing in order not to lose everything.\nAllowing dry eyelids to fade in anguish that all is well, very well. Finding himself a place, a reason and a path to follow, consecrated behind the footprint that will extend that beginning.\n\nThe beginning of a search for the meaning of my own creation.\nDeciding to question its value, although it is very clear that it is not possible to calculate. The wait overwhelmed me. Today I am here.",
