    "description": "I know of a well-respected man;\nwho never cease to pray.\nMany times I have wondered what keeps him going.\nBut it always balls down to his love for what's eternal.\n\nI speak of a dedicated soldier of valor,\nwho is always girded in strong armor.\nMany times have I wondered if he was a bachelor\nBecause he never takes a rest from labor.\n\nA man whose vine is rooted in a strong foundation,\nand structured to be lifted up in godly formation.\nRespectful, resilient, loving, loyal, and kind,\nof strong moral conviction and security in his mind, \nknowing who he is and what he could be,\nhaving healthy relationships with his followers.\n\nA man concerned about his community.\nWho comprehends we live in a global society.\nA man who gets involved and does not stay isolated,\nAs we are all a part of this world that God created.\nA man who loves and respects his family and community.\nA man strongly rooted, striding humbly and secure in his spirituality \n\nCORNELIUS!!!",
