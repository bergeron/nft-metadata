    "description": "It's sad to feel like you don't belong in this world of faceless passers-by.  \n \n Where do your feet go every morning?  \n You walk the narrow path until the end of the day,  \n you lie down and look at the ceiling that collapses in your nose without being able to do anything, \nor rather without wanting to do anything, because you don't feel it.  \n \n How sad it is not to feel!  \n \n The sentence pierces the mind, while the putrid smell of the city embraces you.  \n  \n The mask is your refuge,  \n you walk in silence,  \n again the muteness corrodes you.  \n \n The silence is screams that drown out the words",
