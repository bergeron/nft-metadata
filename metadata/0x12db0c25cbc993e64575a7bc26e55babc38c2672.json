    "description": "Moments when you need to be unyielding, as if behind a helmet that hides unnecessary from your eyes and gives the shape of a solid monolith in the eyes of those who's looking. I show you one of her faces, faces that leave on themselves the imprint of every look, thought, word, meeting, unfulfilled desire... We see her, him as they see you, me, us\nThe work of the result of synthesis of photography, layers of different types of papers, fire, and the game of light. ",
