    "description": "I am a photography based digital artist.\n\nI'm re-constructing the images by using my own photos to design new places, new stories. I melt miscellaneous media, content and emotion to create an original artwork free from time. \nCan also be defined as a Photographic Matte Designer. \n\nThis piece was the \"Star\" artwork from my first solo exhibition called \"Are You Awake?\" \nThis last edition will be presented as NFT. (1/1)\n100x100cm - 300dpi\nAs an artist I prefer to create spiritual, philosophical and abstract content to connect with the viewer.\n#photography #portrait #portraitphotography #figurative #expressionist #surrealism\n",
