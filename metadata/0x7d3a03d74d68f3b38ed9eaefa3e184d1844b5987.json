    "description": "Meta-Normalized Strangeness\n\nDigital structure manipulation of interpenetrating water patterns from the original visual material (photography) created for Normalized Strangeness, a painting/photography project (2020-2022).  \nMeta comes from the Greek prefix and preposition meta, which means “after” or “beyond.” (Liddell, Scott)  \nWater patterns represent Li principle in Taoism.  \nInterpenetration is illustrated in the Avatamsaka Sutra by the metaphor of Indra’s net.\n\n                                                             ~  \nPlanet of Pain-Love  \n(Digital artwork from original photography)\n\nRumi, my cat, looks like a baby tiger to me.  \nWhen he was a kitten he was very energetic and while we were playing it could happened that he scratched me and made me bleed. The marks from the scratches strangely were not a bad memory, but a memory full of love.  \nFrom closeness, hurting accidentally someone on the surface could reveal your true self and heart (my water heart).\n\n5000x5000px\n\nIf you get in touch with me within 30 days, I will send you a signed 50x 50 cm print of Planet of Pain/Love on Hahnemuehle William Turner fine art paper 310 msg .",
