    "description": "Self Portrait\nDimensions: 4000 x 6000\nResolution: 240x 240\nCamera: Canon EOS Rebel T6i\nLens: 70mm F2.8 DG Macro Art\n\nEvery part of this set was thought out to help create a tropical mood.\n- Warm tones come from the natural sunlight peaking in through the nearby windows.\n- Body Jewelry added a fun sparkle and helped bring out those warm tones.\n- Huge leaf brings nature into the photo. Having the leaf be a big tropical leaf helps the viewer place the location of where this could be.\n\nEverything comes together to help convey a tropical paradise even though I am standing in my living room.",
