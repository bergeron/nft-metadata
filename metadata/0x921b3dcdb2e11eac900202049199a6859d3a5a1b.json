    "description": "on september 5th, late at night, i got a text.  it was from deegan.  an audio file.  no instruments, no production of any kind.  just his voice.  \n\nby the time i had reached the end of the recording, i was tearing up.  i'd never heard him so vulnerable and raw.  i immediately dragged the file into ableton 9 and started producing around it.  i worked until 5 am.  it was the most cathartic musical experience i had had in months.  i hope this song can do for you what it has done for me.  <3",
