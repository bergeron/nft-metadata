    "description": "Rising to the top in this world is never easy. It always comes with a price , and sometimes the price is a little too much to pay . But if we are resilient and positive we might be able to make it, we just might. But if we don't try for sure would not be able to make it to the top.\n\n\n\nArtist  - Ritam Bhattacharya\nGenre - Landscape Photography\nEdition - 1/1\nPlace - Darjeeling, India\n\nLicense : Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising, display privately and in groups, including virtual galleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the NFT, as long as creator is credited.
