    "description": "After midnight at an outdoor music festival on a farm in rural North Carolina, I noticed a gentle fog settling into the fields where the music tents and stages were located. I was on an assignment and to this point, my images were boring and bland. Typical music festival images. As the fog grew, the music tents began to glow from the stage lighting, as colored light spilled out of the tents and became diffused by the fog. A gift from the lighting goddesses had arrived and my lingering until after midnight, in the damp rainy weather, had paid off. I was dancing in a sea of colored silhouettes and glowing tents. \n\nAll the proceeds from this collection will support my work as an active builder in the ImpactDAO ecosystem.
