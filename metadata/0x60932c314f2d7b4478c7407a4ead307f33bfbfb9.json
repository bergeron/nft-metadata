    "description": "This piece is about good verses evil and what that means about the best and worst of humanity. \n\nDo both exist in all of us? Where does the good or evil stem from? Are we born with it? Trained into it? Hurt enough or nurtured enough to become one or the other? \n\nHow is it that some people survive with their good intact while others fall into the abyss of evil and continue the perpetual cycle of hurt?\n\nArt piece created in Procreate and Photoshop.\n\n",
