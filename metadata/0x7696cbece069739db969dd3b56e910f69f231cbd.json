    "description": "In the dark, you'll discover those who will leave you in it, those who will stand with you, and those who will spark a fire to guide you out. Before I took this photo, I watched as two friends attempted to convince the third friend to jump in. The hesitant girl was terrified and worried that it'd be too cold, so her friends offered to jump in first to let her know that everything would be okay. A moment later, they jumped in together and rose to the surface with smiles and laughter. This image is proof that when we are paralyzed in fear, the love in our lives can guide us out. With their unconditional love--family and friends can jolt us from fear's grip to help us begin living our lives again. They are proof that we are never alone in our struggle, and that we need only to look up and take their hands. \"Jolt\" represents the way love stimulates joy, releases us from fear, and promises adventure when we follow it out of the dark.  - Jen Tai",
