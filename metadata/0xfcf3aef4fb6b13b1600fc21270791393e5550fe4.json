    "description": "This abstract surrealist oil painting features towering architecture, a mysterious form wrapped in fabric and bound with ropes, a series of small objects standing guard along the bottom margin, and in the far distance, glimpsed through smog, there stands a factory. A haunting, dreamlike quality is achieved by omitting the horizon line, leaving no distinction between the land and sky. This work has been published in several journals, including The Bookends Review and The Good Life Review (forthcoming). ",
