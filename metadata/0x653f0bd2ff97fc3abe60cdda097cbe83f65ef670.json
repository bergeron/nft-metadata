No matter the state of the world around her, she found solace in the rows of flashing lights and whirling sounds of the game center- a sense of peace intermixed in the chaos. \n\nOften times she wouldnâ€™t even play, simply choosing to absorb the abundance of joy that flowed from the smiling otaku. \n\nRain or Shine, she knew she always had a home away from home. \n\nEdition of 25.",
