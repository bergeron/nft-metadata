    "description": "Dichotomy is the first piece of the In My Mind series. \n\nThe In My Mind series explores stories of self-discovery and mental health. Narratives are told through art inspired by Minimalism and personal experiences shaped from a Chinese American background. \n\nDichotomy explores the concept of being stuck between two worlds. As a young Chinese American, I have experienced the struggle of finding an identity that I could resonate with. I had few role models to look up to while growing up as a kid in American society and often felt ashamed of my Chinese background. \n\nAs I get older, I appreciate the cultural differences and unique perspectives that is made possible by my Chinese heritage. \n\n\n\n",
