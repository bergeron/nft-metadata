    "description": "Rocco's first NFT drop on Foundation\n\nThe purchase of this NFT will include the physical art piece featured on a 24'' x 36'' Wood Canvas. Combination of brushed acrylic and spray paint with a resin finish.\n\nInspired by the \"Neon Sign Guy\" u/bonzurr on Reddit. Rocco strived to capture the GME saga in one simplistic image of purple circle unity. With all the buzz of Gamestop entering the NFT space, it was only fitting to offer this piece as his first 1/1 NFT. \nâ€‹\nThe buyer of this piece can contact Rocco at info@roccosmodernart.com to verify shipping of the original art piece. Verification will be required. Shipping within the US will be covered by Rocco. \n\nRocco reserves the dual commercial rights to this image for the purpose of selling prints. The original purchaser of this NFT and recipient of the physical art reserves the right to retain the physical art piece should the purchaser decide to resell the NFT.",
