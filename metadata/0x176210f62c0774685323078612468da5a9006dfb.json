    "description": "It all starts with a calm sea. Yachting at sea is always a thrilling amazing ride. Calm seas generally bring fun and sun while relaxing enjoying the motivational views from the ocean. Calm seas sometimes bring clouds and rain. When clouds and rain appear, sometimes things can start to get out of hand. The wind picks up and the clouds circle till the storm breaks. Suddenly, the ground cracks, lava gushes out, mountains rise from the oceans. We did not realize that we went through a portal through the Bermuda triangle and teleported into an apocalyptic era. There is only one solution. The solution is to take flight and get away from this chaos. We must flee this planet as quickly as possible, and find a new place to go.",
