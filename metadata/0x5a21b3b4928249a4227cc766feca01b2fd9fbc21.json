    "description": "Doom\nIt is as if from the beginning, in the absence of us all, it was arranged that those who have read something are to determine destiny, and those who appreciate this abode are those who take the destiny of others in their hands.\nThen read, read aloud in the name of he who has authorised your fortune. And, we have read in the name of all those who made the destiny of others their own inherited fate, so that in the path of destiny they lead all to a place to which they are forced to be destined. Then read, read in the name of misjudgement, for that he who did not commit wrong was ordered to be flogged and his naked body dragged from orient to occident, as if dragging was the inevitable directive for the marks that are forever ordered. Then read, read in the name of \"Khataei\" who mixed blunders with lines, and who, following the icon of the convict's fate, hanged the crucified as well \nas the beloved, from an incident.",
