    "description": "This is a digital objet trouv√© (found art). Researched, discovered and filmed, placed on his virtual black turntable by artist Josh von Staudach in the expanse of Google Earth's 3D-space.\n\nWatching it turn and spin forever is mesmerizing. Like in a cloud that drifts by, you'll recover manifold features in every rotation. But your resemblance to reality is being refused. The digital procedures have washed away any symbolic content and cultural importance, historic merits are no longer. The sheer appearance in 3D realm is questioning its own existence.\n\nWhat has happened? The equestrian statue of Ferdinando I de Medici in Florence has been mangled through a process of aerial photography and AI photogrammetry, transferred to polygonic clusters that were edited by unknown human operators whose skills vary significantly. Finally the object was textured with a warped low-res picture of the real scenery. \n\n43.77637195968134,11.26051433399804\n\nwww.joshvonstaudach.de/3da",
