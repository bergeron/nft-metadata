    "description": "My art process leads with the notion of diligence and simplicity applicable to innovative culture and traditional media. Exercising principles and design elements, such as; rhythm, value, line, and color, to name a few, guides my development. The complementary studies that inspire my studio habits are Community Networking Formats, Ecological Design Services, and Visual Systems.\n\nMy objective is to facilitate the movement of art and design foundations, within a nurturing studio environment, by cherishing semantic aesthetics, including the praxis of structured productivity from conventional methods, algorithmic perception, and abstract concepts. These current design objectives administer an open-source of solutions, involving awareness on problem-solving, historical perspective, and practical/theoretical proficiency.",
