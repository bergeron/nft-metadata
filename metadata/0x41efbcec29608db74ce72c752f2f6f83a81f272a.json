    "description": "A sipa is a forest harpy or half-winged half-bird, a genus of large birds of prey. They live above the tops of the tallest trees. One of the largest birds, they are distinguished by their mostly dark plumage and long, broad, powerful wings for maneuverability in windy forests. Their wings lift them very high into the sky above the scorching sun, which is not dangerous for them, because due to the structure of their plumage at high altitude they are not hot and not cold, but they have only one disadvantage - they have weak legs, which can not lift a heavy carcass. \n\nThere is a legend that they came down from the sun itself, because the sun gave them the golden hue of their eyes. For when they hunt, they hide under the sun and as soon as they begin their attack, their prey does not have time to see them, for they immediately appear and kill their prey...\n\n The great guardian of the forest, Morohir, is sworn to protect them, as they are an important part of the continent's food chain.",
