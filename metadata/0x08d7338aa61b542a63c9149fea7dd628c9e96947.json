    "description": "It would be out of place to talk about my strength. Because my competitors are witnessing it all the time! How could I have known that when it was a small breakup story that started my story, it would be the best parting in my life that would take me back to where I belong? Now I am fighting to create a new life for myself among all the stars and planets. Thanks to Ronuca, the entire planet is observing what real war is. My difference from them is that I can direct meteor fragments. I can throw meteors at the speed I want, wherever I want. They just look at me with admiration. Now, at this point that makes me who I am as Ronuca, my only goal is to prove myself to everyone. And then regretting everyone who did this to me. That's why I have to take down everybody until I get back. My time here will pass very quickly.",
