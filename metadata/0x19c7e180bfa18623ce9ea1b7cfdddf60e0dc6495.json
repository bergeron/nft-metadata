    "description": "Fused with bright, deep, vibrant colours and hundreds of dots and splattered paint and ink.\n\nA key element in my work is to evoke an emotion through the use of colour and a range of mark-making techniques. When we experience the beauty in nature we are often left feeling in awe of its magnificence. I also believe it takes us into a reflective state and acts as a form of meditation- away from the noise, pressures and anxieties we face on a daily basis. I use dots to create movement and to show natureâ€™s beauty and how it possesses an inexhaustible vitality and the promise of infinity. \n\nTitle. Berry Crush\nSeries. Colour Drop\nSize. 4961 x 7123",
