This area is known for its natural beauty and there are a myriad of options for taking in the sights. I was up for a casual trail to see what I could find and was pleasantly surprised that I had this entire area to myself to explore.\n\nThe main attraction of this trail is where it leads up to the pond, but especially with the season change there is beauty all around. The pond is connected to the Indian River which meets up to the Hudson River, all resting within the massive 6 million acres that comprise the Adirondack Park (the largest park in the contiguous US). \n\nThere are many gems like this to be found on any number of the hiking trails and mountains in the area. Just be sure to look all around you while you are there!\n\nLicense: Editorial",
