    "description": "see ya next year (ft. brother bird)\n\nwe wanted to write a song for the slow days after the holidays, and before the end of the year.. when you're reflective about the long year that went by too fast, while simultaneously being excited for the new one.\n\nTo my current collectors, thanks so much for being such a big part of my 2022, I'm wildly grateful for the support and community I found this year.  I have high hopes for the music nft fam in 2023 :) xo\n\n\n**\nI AM THRILLED to be introducing my friend Caroline to the web3/music nft space with our holiday collab exclusively on Sound! \n\nBrother Bird is the Nashville-based solo project of Caroline Swon. She embraces an intimate, ethereal style of indie rock in her 2018 self-titled EP, and has since worked closely with her friends/mentors Andy Hull & Robert McDowell of Manchester Orchestra on her first full length album, ‘gardens’. Released at the end of 2021, this record showcases a more energetic and playful sound from Swon, while still touching on her trademark vulnerability. \n\nIn addition to joining Manchester Orchestra on the road for their co-headlining tour with The Front Bottoms, Swon has also opened up for several other artists such as Pete Yorn, Cavetown, Pinegrove, Bad Books, Lily & Madeleine, and Old Sea Brigade. \n\nsee you next year (ft. brother bird)\n(V1)\nSO, HERE WE GO AGAIN\nTHERE'S A LINE OUTSIDE OF THE GYM\nEVERYONES IN A HURRY TO BEGIN\nRESOLUTIONS \n\n(V2)\nOH, WE SPEND THE WHOLE MONTH\nGIVING AWAY ALL THE STUFF \nWE DON’T WANT\nTHINKING MAN, WE REALLY GAVE \nALL WE GOT\nSEE YA NEXT YEAR...\n\n(PRE)\nTHE PARTY'S OVER \nAND IT HASN’T EVEN STARTED\nWHAT IF WE STAY \nIN THIS POST HOLIDAY TOGETHER\n\n(CH)\nWHY DON’T WE STAY HERE?\nIN THESE FEW LITTLE DAYS HERE?\nRIGHT BEFORE THE NEW YEAR.\nWE BOTH HAVE NOTHING TO DO\n\nTHIS IS THE GOOD PART\nRIGHT BEFORE THE BIG RESTART\nBEFORE ALL THE CHAOS\nCOMES INTO VIEW \n\n(POST)\nWHY DON'T WE STAY HERE?\nIN THESE FEW LITTLE DAYS HERE?\nRIGHT BEFORE THE NEW YEAR,\nWE HAVE NOTHING TO DO\n\n(V3) \nBEFORE ALL THE MAGIC IS GONE\nAND THE TREE IS OUT ON THE LAWN\nYOUR FAMILY \nAND FRIENDS HAVEN’T GONE YET\nSO, WHY DON’T WE STAY HERE?\n\nwritten / performed / produced by :\nKathleen Regan, brother bird\nmixed by :\nStudiodad.eth",
