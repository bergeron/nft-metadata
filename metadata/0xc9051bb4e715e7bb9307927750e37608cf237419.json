    "description": "We retreated inside that unknown cave.\nNo harm will find us there.\nHere is only us soaking into solitude.\nAnd we hear in silence, the magical whisper talking to us.\nSomething I had forgotten so far,\nThat was always with me:\n“Soul”\nSolitude is the spirituality of the soul.\nIt is the voice of the self that we have so longed to hear. \nIt is the doorway to the mystery that is within us all.",
