    "description": "Good & Evil is an ongoing series that plays with different angel and devil tropes while adding my own iconography to these stories. In this series I have certain angel or devil designs that I like to repeat. This devil’s name is Damon and he’s usually opposite an angel named Evan. In this piece, Damon is a king on a throne that resembles a grave. Like many Good & Evil pieces, I wanted the background to feel desolate and liminal to feel like a version of purgatory.",
