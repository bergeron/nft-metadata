    "description": "This photo montage consists of over 30 individual photographs from Natalie Christensen and Jim Eyre. This work is created through a painstaking process of deconstructing and decontextualizing photos from each of our archives in a response to COVID-19. New compositions were made in rough collages that were passed back and forth, edited and re-edited until the new artwork was barely recognizable from the originals. VARIANT(S) responds to the evolving crisis and the rise of variants during the global pandemic.  This work is exhibited at Turner Carroll Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The physical art piece measures 96\" x 63\" . ",
