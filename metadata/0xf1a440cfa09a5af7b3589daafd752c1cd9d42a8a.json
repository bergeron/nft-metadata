    "description": "And she let the flames burn. She let it burn all of her despair, pain, hurt, sadness, anger and disappointments. The fire raged and she gave herself to it, letting it burn, even to the coldest and darkest parts of her that she kept hidden from the world. For from these flames, she shall emerge, reborn.\n\nCollector of this piece will get a signed canvas print shipped anywhere in the world.",
