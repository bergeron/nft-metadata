    "description": "Juan Tamad is a character that is true to all humanity, a metaphor for humanity’s laziness, procrastination, and complacency that knows no boundaries in terms of race, socio-political, and cultural affiliations. A character that has always been judged, shunned, and renounced by the many; a character of failure and disappointment that everyone avoids. In Juan’s lazy tales, his name and his shadowy reputation is a stigma that labels anyone who is deemed as unproductive, whether at home or in the workplace. Yet we are prompted to question this thought: Is Juan Tamad really lazy? Or is there some hidden truth one has to see?\n\nThis Juan Tamad character is from present who can communicate to the Tamads of the future and the past. By diverting his consciousness energy to the frequencies of the dimensions of his inner self, he was able to get in contact with her wisdom of the past and his desire of the future.",
