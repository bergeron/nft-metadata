    "description": "Don Quixote was a favorite subject of Mallary, especially during his Mexico City period. The romantic ideals embodied in the character appealed to him deeply, and similar themes repeat themselves often in his work. As an artist and activist of the avant-garde, he greatly enjoyed tilting at the windmills of convention at every opportunity.",
