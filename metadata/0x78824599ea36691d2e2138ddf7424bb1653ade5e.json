    "description": "Around the time of this shoot with Mac Miller, I was in a phase of buying a load of old point-and-shoot cameras from car-boot sales, trying to find a hidden gem.\n\nI bought a random, janky Pentax Espio for Â£1 and it already had a roll of Fuji Superia loaded in it. To test it out, I blasted through the roll with Mac.\n\nWhen I got the scans back, it turned out I had shot over an old manâ€™s holiday photos that had never been developed on the first half of the roll. Itâ€™s hard to tell exactly when/where theyâ€™re from but they seem like a New Zealand-based trip from the 1980s.\n\nNow I have a handful of these mashed-up double exposure images that the world never knew it needed. One of the dayâ€™s many happy accidents ðŸ–¤\n\n3000 x 3000\n35mm film\nPhotography and design by Henry Dean, 2016",
