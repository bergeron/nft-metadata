    "description": "A lone rabbit is seen cavorting about in a post-armageddon world. Although it’s not clear exactly what transpired, scenes of abandoned factories hint at an industrially triggered climate disaster. Traveling through swirling trans-dimensional portals, the rabbit presides over scenes of mayhem and destruction. Evidence of the rabbit’s role throughout history emerges in ancient documents, from Eastern block printing to Mughal Empire paintings to Medieval parchments, and mythic dot paintings. The rabbit has always been with us.",
