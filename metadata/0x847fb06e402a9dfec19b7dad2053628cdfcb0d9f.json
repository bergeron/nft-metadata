    "description": "It was on a late afternoon with a Canon AE-1 loaded with a Kodak Portra 400 35mm film that the idea of an improptu photo shoot happened. For some reason the atmosphere of that particular day was special.\n\nThe chemistry between model and camera was pretty much spontaneous. A unique statement on the value of analog photography into the blockchain era. \n\nThis piece regards to a collection of shots that represents a great collaboration on the real power of film photography and the assertion of it as an artform. \n\nShot on Canon AE-1 - Kodak Portra 400 / 5PM Late 2020.",
