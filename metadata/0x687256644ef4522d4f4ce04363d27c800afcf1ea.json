    "description": "As a floral enthusiast and 3D surrealist, Brendi takes elements of real-world flowers and reimagines them for the fantastical 3D-space.\n\nWith her detailed eye for texture and form, Brendi meticulously modeled every aspect of 'Iris Elation', one of the very first surrealist blooms to take place in the Metaverse.\n\nFrom start to finish, she used no publicly sourced models, creating a truly unique digital artwork.\n\n'Iris Elation' is featured and minted as a part of the Satellite NFT Art Exhibition. Satellite is Sydneyâ€™s first 3D NFT art exhibition and will be opening for the public 10 March-3 April 2022 at Twenty Twenty Six gallery. Works available on foundation.app from 9 March, 6.30pm AEDT\n",
