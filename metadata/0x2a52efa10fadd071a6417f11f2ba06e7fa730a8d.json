    "description": "Hi, my name is Sergey Makashin and I'm from Siberia. I shot a series with photos of beautiful women who cry. Everyone had their own reason for tears, love, loss, state of mind, joy or sadness. I took these photos for the exhibition - but I never found a suitable platform for this. I hope the Foundation will become this platform for me and the works that I have been shooting for 2 years will live here. From the sale of this work, I will post new portraits from this series. Thank you, I will be glad if you like my black and white photos",
