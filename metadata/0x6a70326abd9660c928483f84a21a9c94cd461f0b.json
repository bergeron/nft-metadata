    "description": "TALE OF THE PIG KING collaboration by Joe Whale & Henrik Uldalen & Tania Rivilis & Victoria West & Laurence Fuller\n\nFables weave the fabric of our culture, they are the underlying narratives that make up the human story. From our earliest years, we read fables to our children as the creativity of the young connects poetic metaphors to the world around us. Through fables of caution, folly, consequence and triumph, we learn of our frailties and fervor, negotiating with giants and outwitting witches with dangerous intentions to claim the prize with grace and save the day from conflicting forces. Fables are the timeless universal human stories we follow as guiding lights like a map of our emotional and spiritual lives.” —Laurence Fuller, Actor, Poet & Web3 Artist\n\nBe grateful for what you have ~ unless you wish to chase bliss forever.\n\nDoodle by Joe Whale (AKA The Doodle Boy)\nDigital Painting by Henrik Uldalen\nDigital Painting by Tania Rivilis\nPhotography by Victoria West\nAI Animation & Music by Laurence Fuller\nPoetry by Laurence Fuller\nProduced & Performed by Laurence Fuller\n\nOnce Upon A Time,\nThere was a sleeping King.\nHe followed the lines,\nIn front of his eyes,\nAs they curled into the forest,\nWhere they live.\n\nSunk into Leda’s lake,\nSurrounded by sirens of an unusual fate,\nThey flutter shifting shapes,\nThese sirens pull him deeper,\nTheir feathers make him weaker,\nThe forest reflecting glimmers on the water,\nPULL HIM UNDER\n\nWolves run through the fog,\nBloated croaking frogs,\nWet, cold and steaming rocks,\nTheir paws trampling leaves & roots & logs,\nSprinting over moss,\nThey howl as their paths cross\n\nHe thought he married well,\nSealed it with a black lipped kiss,\nNow it’s a hopeless tale to tell,\nLost forever chasing bliss.\nUnder the spell of the white witch.\n\nEmerging from the lake,\nHooves, and snout in wait,\nSuch an unusual fate,\nThe form that was once a King,\nTransformed into a pig.\n\n~ Laurence Fuller, 2023",
