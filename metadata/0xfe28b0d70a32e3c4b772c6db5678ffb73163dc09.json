    "description": "This was an unreleased 3 track EP that I had meant to drop in the Summer of 2019, yet symptoms of perfectionism made it so that it never seen the light of day. The silver lining is all content I create, is done in a timeless manner, and is pretty cool to reference this project as to far I have came as an artist.\n\nAt the time, I was in love with one particular altcoin, Po.et, which their core focus was empowering content creators the ability to have provenance over their content they submitted. Little did I know I'd only come to find out what that really meant throughout this past year down the rabbithole of NFTs!\n\nPurchase of this NFT comes with three unreleased, rough versions of songs that have never seen the light of day, that will be emailed once NFT is received. \n\n1.) Forcin' Me To Choose  \n2.) Ode to the Vagabonds  \n3.) Groovy",
