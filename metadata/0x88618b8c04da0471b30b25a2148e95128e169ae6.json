    "description": "Dear younger self,\n\nI don’t think you ever imagined going to South Dakota, but here we are, chasing rainbows in Badlands, spending days in the Black Hills, and absorbing every moment of your last few weeks of comfort. You’re on the precipice of comfort and chasing your dreams. In a few short weeks, you’ll abandon your job, home, and stability to chase what you’ve wanted your entire life and it doesn’t feel real yet.\n\nThis is where you think you fall in love. Every scene here feels like it’s straight out of a movie, a fairytale so perfect it has to be real. You think there’s a treasure at the end of the rainbow, but the not all that glitters is gold. Embrace the moments, embrace the experience, but sometimes in life you get the movie scenes without the plot.\n\nThese moments feel too good to be true, they're lessons you need to learn in life; but embrace them and the company you’re with even if “I love you” is temporary.\n\nSouth Dakota, December 2020, Portra 800",
