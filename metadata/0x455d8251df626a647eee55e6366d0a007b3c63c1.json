    "name": "I healed over tea",
    "description": "I pour myself another cup,\nThe only good thing I've been doing for myself.\nIt's small, it's kind,\nIt's better than pouring from my mind.\nTea doesn't ask questions, tea doesn't ridicule my mistakes.\nTea just listens, tea understands, \nAnd tea doesn't take.\n\n-Marilyn D'cruz\n\nThis collaborative artwork by Ishleen and Marilyn is the reflection of a healing journey. Tea is an integral element and an artistic expression that flows through the work of both the creators. \n\nThe artwork is an intersection of the magical journeys of growth, self love and empathy that brings these two artists together.",
