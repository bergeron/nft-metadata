    "description": "Once in the autumn forest...\n\nA cute little fox girl named Cherry was walking through the woods. Suddenly she saw Richie. It was a cute corgi. Thanks to the red color and fluffy tail, Richie was very similar to a small fox cub. Cherry immediately fell in love with Ricci. She takes care of him like an older sister and doesn't let anyone get too close to Richie.",
