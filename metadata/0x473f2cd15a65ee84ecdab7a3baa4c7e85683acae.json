    "description": "Companies made millions with a system that kept artists marginalized by using their art, without consent, to generate exquisite corpses (collaborative surrealist art pieces) for profits never shared with the artists. \n\nThis is a small (and marginalized) art collection with six unique, handmade pieces. No AI is used. Each AI bot arrested represents one of the five continents and their participation in the cyberpunk world we are living in. They are us. When nobody is responsible, everybody is.",
