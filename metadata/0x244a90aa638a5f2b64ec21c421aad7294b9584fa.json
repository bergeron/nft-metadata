    "description": "There are four stages in life. Birth, perception, becoming a meta, and death. These phases are inevitable. We open our eyes to the world and try to understand it. We observe the world around us and sometimes ask questions. Then we try to decide what kind of meta we will become with our so-called free will. No matter what happens, we will become a meta.All humanity is a meta. All human beings are Meta-Being.\n\nModel: Asrın Bianchi\n\nSize: 4665 × 8016",
