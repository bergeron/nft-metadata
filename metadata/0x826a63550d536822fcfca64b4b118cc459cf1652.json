    "description": "The first official WesGhost release “Sleepwalking” is the very beginning of my story through the sounds inside my head. I’ve always been felt like an outcast & wanted to make music for people that don’t feel seen just like me. This song is about wanting to stay in that dream state & never wanting to wake up & face the world alone. Influenced by my love for 90s/00s alternative & hip hop, “Sleepwalking” is the very first chapter inside the mind of a ghost.",
