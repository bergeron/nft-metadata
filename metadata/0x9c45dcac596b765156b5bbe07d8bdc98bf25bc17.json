    "description": "It is argued that as humans have developed and evolved, they have also become increasingly detached from the natural world. These souls have become nearly omnipresent, inching closer and closer to God.\n\nThis piece dabbles with the theory of reintroducing nature in order to maintain humanity. History repeats itself.Â \n\nThrough divine intervention, vegetation and wildlife are restored. Rehabilitating the natural processes that sustain mortality.\n\nWe must rediscover a sense of wonder, respect, and reverence for nature.\n\nThere will be a burn. You are able to collect 2 editions. 1 to keep, 1 to burn.",
