    "description": "Ants love Money, and honey, as they both taste as sweet. In the ANT_E_ROOMS, they worship both. \n\nEnter 'The Money God', his face kind and wise, his robes and throne crafted out of pure 24 carat gold! Yum Yum. In the sky, three ants gaze down, mesmerized by the beautiful sight of gold below. \n\nSee the queen ants look up and worship 'The Money God', a God that humans love to worship in every form he loves to take - luxury cars, beautiful homes, designer clothes, and most importantly, happy healthy families as the Money God knows that health, happiness and family are the purest form of wealth.\n  \nNo wonder the ants love to worship him. They say that he makes all those who own him, people and ants, rich and wealthy in every beautiful way.",
