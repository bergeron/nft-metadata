    "description": "\"Alive\" is a look a life in its stillness, the ways in which inanimate objects take on the energy and lives of everyone who has ever interacted with it. \n\nMany times the items we pass by in our day to day have lived many lifetimes, seen the decaying passage of time, and have outlived the people they once belonged to. \n\n\"Alive\" peaks into the things that live through the lives of the people that have possessed them until ultimately they take on a life of their own.\n\nNFT PHOTOGRAPHY COLLECTION: STILL LIFE",
