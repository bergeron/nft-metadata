    "description": "Take part in designing the first community designed Sneaker NFT by casting your votes in our Discord: https://discord.gg/wqS8Ebbrva. (To cast your vote, you will need to verify you own this NFT by using the #collabland-join channel in the discord.)  Signature Sneaker 'Community Design' is an interactive airdrop for Signature Sneaker collectors. Via a series of polls in the Signature Sneakers Discord, the holders of this NFT can vote on the design choices to develop the colorway. Each time a vote ends, the NFT will update and change over time. Once the design is complete, the metadata will be frozen and the very first Community Designed Sneaker NFT will be locked in.  Check out the Signature Sneakers Generative collection here: https://bit.ly/SigSneakersNFT",
