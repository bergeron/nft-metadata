    "description": "Kala RauÂ is an evil spirit or devil in Balinese mythology.  This demon is only formed from a head without a body.  At one time he wanted to drink water from Tirta Amertha (water of eternal life), even though this water was only meant for the gods.  Dewi Ratih who knew about this told the god Vishnu, who then threw her disc and beheaded the demon.  But at that time, the head up to the neck had touched Tirta Amertha, so that he could live forever.  The head was then about to take revenge on the goddess Ratih and chase her in heaven.  Sometimes the goddess Ratih is caught and according to this myth a lunar eclipse occurs",
