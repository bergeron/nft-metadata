    "description": "I just don't talk about myself. It's really not my thing.\n\nI was driving around the Badlands in South Dakota all night long looking for a place to shoot star trails. I was there until the sunrise.\n\nA lot had happened in my life in the previous 15 years. A cancer survivor, losing both of my parents. \n\nIn my collections, I tend to present black and white. I love the shadows and light - and maybe i see better that way. But not on this day.\n\nI captured this sunrise in all of its beauty. It was the culmination of 15 years of struggle, and the start of something new. It was the end and the beginning for me.\n\nI ask the price that I do because of how valuable this is to me. ",
