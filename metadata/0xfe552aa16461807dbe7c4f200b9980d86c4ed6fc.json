    "description": "July 13th 2019 was a day I will never forget.\n\nOn this day mother nature showed me the most amazing sunset of my life. A severe warned storm was roaming southern Saskatchewan along the international border. After chasing this storm from birth I got the perfect ending when the sun started to set perfectly behind it creating a once in a lifetime moment.",
