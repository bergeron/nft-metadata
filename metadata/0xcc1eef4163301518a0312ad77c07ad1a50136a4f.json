    "description": "BIT.R.I.O.L. is a meditative piece and original soundscape created by Tanky - Leticia Almeida and C03RA - Mathías Chumino.\n\nThe title comes from the acronym V.I.T.R.I.O.L., in Latin: “Visita Interiora Terræ Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem” meaning \"Visit the interior of the Earth, and by rectifying (yourself) you will find the hidden stone.”\n\nInspired by the alchemical tradition and rites of passage, with a Technopagan approach,  BIT.R.I.O.L. proposes an esoteric experience of contemplation and transcendence.\n\nThere is an augmented reality / mixed reality experience to this piece, you can try it and read more about the process behind it here: bit.ly/bitriol\n\n“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”. Arthur C. Clarke",
