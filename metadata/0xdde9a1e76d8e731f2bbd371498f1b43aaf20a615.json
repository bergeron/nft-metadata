    "description": "This is [art]ificial #1 by Pixedelic.\n\n[art]ificial work is proteiform, born from legacy art augmented with AI and hand made scripts.\n\nThe idea behind [art]ificial is to create images with extended perspectives to dive into unique fantasy and sci-fi atmospheres. There is no given interpretation, each of us can feel it and see something different.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (AI) used for this generative art is a next generation algorithm, capable of creating astonishing images with no artefact.\n\nMy inspiration comes from many artists, including :\n - Comics masters : Philippe Druillet and Jack Kirby\n - Famous painters : Gustave Dore and Fernand Leger\n - And many unkown street artists \n\nResolution : 4000 x 4000 px",
