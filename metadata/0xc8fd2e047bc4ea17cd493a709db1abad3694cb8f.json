This was the day I discovered the tree and was amazed as it sat submerged after weeks of solid rain. It is difficult not to be inspired by the location, not only for the hardiness of tree, but also the imposing and ancient mountains that watch over it.</p><p>The original collector receives a fine art print.</p>",
