    "description": "Horse symbolism covers a very wide range, extending from light to darkness, from heaven to earth, from life to death. For me, the horse is associated with freedom, strength and spirit. This is why the silhouette of a running horse was taken to create this animation.\nTwelve different images were used in the animation, embodying the cycle of the moving world.\nFreedom, movement, and strength of spirit are what enable us to create, evolve, and be here.\n\n\nMusical accompaniment was created by Ukrainian music producer The lazy Jesus",
