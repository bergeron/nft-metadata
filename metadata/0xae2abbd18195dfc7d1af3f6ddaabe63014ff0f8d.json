    "description": "## Description\n\nAs a father of two little girls, Johnny's got a lot to lose. He got burned hard for 1,000 BTC on Mt. Gox years ago, and hasn’t stopped looking for revenge since. His family thinks he is an Actuary working for a Venture Capital Firm. All his suits cost $3,000+, and he's home by 10 pm every night. Cut and dry, with the heart of a lion.\n\n## Role\n\nThe only level headed one in the group, this family man looks squeaky clean – but he’s also a fierce leader and defender of the gang. Johnny doesn’t care about anything outside of Ethereum now. He keeps the group educated, and even though he might not know it himself, he is an absolute information nerd.",
