    "description": "- If you don’t want to hear something scary, then don’t ask a scary question,\n\"Pulp Fiction\" , Jules.\nJules is the most optimistic and charming hero from Tarantino’s universe. I adore Jules, his philosophy, his manners. Like a battery, this art inspired us to live. Live full emotional life, eat burgers and ride fast. This art I dedicate to actor S.L.Jackson and his incredible character Jules.",
