    "description": "Simpler Days is a collection of normal daily events in life that all mean a lot to me. Every moment, every second something happens in life that is worth observing or even marveling at.\nThese photographs are shot on analog film and were taken this year in the cities of Paris, Amsterdam, Rome and Naples. They show my photographic work of 2021 in the field of street photography.",
