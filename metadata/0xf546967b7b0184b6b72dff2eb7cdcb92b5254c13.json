    "description": "\"A soft breeze carried petals from the cherry blossoms past Jaxith’s window, flickering pale and gentle in the moonlight, as if to say, What is it you ask of me?\" \n— Lou Wilham (The Prince of Starlight)\n\nMoonlight & Cherry Blossoms is an image that is near and dear to my heart. My very first image that won multiple international awards, this portrait represented the United States at World Photographic Cup 2021. The latex, cherry-blossom headpiece was handmade by me. I hope that M&CB evokes in you the peaceful feeling of a spring night.\n\nA signed high-resolution, fine art print will be sent to the first owner of this NFT.\n\n\n",
