    "description": "Cerro Fitz Roy is one of the most beautiful peaks in the world. Found in the Southern Patagonian Icefield it is known as the \"smoking mountain\" as it is oft shrouded in clouds. However on a rare clear morning,  the uninterrupted flatlands leading east to the Atlantic Ocean, allow for the first rays of the summer sun to paint the granite spire in a dazzling display of light.\n\nThis photograph is was taken by awhurst\nEdition 1/1",
