    "description": "Idea with the piece is to depict the origin or James Webb, which is earth represented through the cityscape and it' s place of belonging i.e. the space with a human in the middle as a point of connection.\n\nIn a mission more than two decades in the making, NASA launched the most expensive science probe ever built Saturday, a $10 billion telescope that will attempt to capture starlight from the first galaxies to be born in the fiery crucible of the Big Bang.\n\nBillions over budget and years behind schedule, the James Webb Space Telescope finally got off the ground Christmas Day, rocketing up from the European Space Agency's launch site in Kourou, French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. EST atop an Ariane 5 rocket.\n\nThe telescope is optimized to capture images of the first stars and galaxies to begin shining in the aftermath of the Big Bang, light that has been stretched into the infrared portion of the spectrum by the expansion of space itself over the past 13.8 billion years.\n\nresolution 1800 x 2880",
