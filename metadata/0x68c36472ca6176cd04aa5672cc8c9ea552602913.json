    "description": "Teenage girl Cherry receives an NFT through her activities in the metaverse. This NFT is created through an algorithm that analyzes Cherry's metaverse activity data.\n\nWhen Red Cherry, an NFT that reflects a side of herself that Cherry doesn't want to see, is created, she dislikes it. One day, Red Cherry splits into two, and Black Cherry is reborn.\n\nRed Cherry represents Cherry's unconscious, while Black Cherry represents her conscious. Cherry feels that Black Cherry has a similar personality to herself, but as time goes on, she finds it difficult to cope with Black Cherry's rage.\n\nCan Cherry find a way for Red Cherry and Black Cherry to coexist?\n\n\n1080x1542, mp4\nAnimation by Wooyah",
