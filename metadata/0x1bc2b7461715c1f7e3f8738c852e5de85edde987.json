    "description": "Emigration has been a sensitive issue since time immemorial. The Incredible Cuban is no stranger to this, however the reasons that drive him to leave his land are not always the most justifiable. The children of the island leave mother earth to fulfill their dreams or to escape the cruel reality of a hopeless dictatorship. Blessed are those who pursue their dreams of freedom. (See Aquaman Vol.1 #45)",
