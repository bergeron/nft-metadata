They are transportable into and useful in metaverse games. \n\n\nFRIBIT: The House of Motley Monsters.\n\nEvery FRIBIT has the power to form and rule its own colony.  \nα-ω polyclones are 24 replicas of their prototypical FRIBIT. While FRIBIT prototypes are ERC-721 non-fungible assets on either Polygon or Ethereum network, polyclones are ER-1155 assets on the Ethereum network. As ERC-1155 tokens, polyclones can function concurrently as fungible and non-fungible assets. They are transportable into and useful in metaverse games. \n\nDepending on availability, owners of a FRIBIT prototype may receive some or all of its polyclones as rewards. However, ownership of a polyclone does not give access to its prototype.",
