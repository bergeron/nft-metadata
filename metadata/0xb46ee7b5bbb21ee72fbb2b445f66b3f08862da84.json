    "description": "I remember seeing this back in the Philippines, I told my Canadian Trainer (She came to Manila to train me for a new role) \"If I’ll be able to step into Canada’s soil. I’ll definitely visit this place!\" A couple of years later, this became my family’s favourite place for short, quick trips.\n\nYou’ll rarely find a site as breathtaking and majestic as Niagara Falls! Located in a strait between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and shared by the United States and Canada, the Falls have become a popular vacation spot for tourist. You can view the Falls year round from observation points on both the American and Canadian sides of the Niagara River. \n\nA visit to Niagara Falls Canada on a summer night will reveal a dazzling display of lights and fireworks. Day and Night, the roar of the Falls and the gently cool mist impresses everyone. This gives tourist an amazing, breathtaking and majestic experience.",
