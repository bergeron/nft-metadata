    "description": "The painting is made in the style of street art #obey from the author @obeygiant, which has become a cult. \"Nesuetis\" means \"Don't worry\". Being in the moment, I feel harmony and this work is a reminder for me to feel this state more often. A simple, memorable image of a peaceful Buddha helps me in this.",
