    "description": "On January 23, 2019, I set sail from lquitos, Peru for the headwaters of the upper Ucayali River to meet with a Shipibo-Conibo ayahuasca medicine worker. Once there, I made friends with this precious monkey! This little guy clung to me like I was its mother, while it played with my hair and made kissing sounds at me. Looking into those deep brown eyes immediately takes me back to that most amazing time in my life. I was at this village for a little over six hours on this trip, so I'm limiting each of these to only 366 immersive NFTs, one for every minute I spent with my monkey friend.",
