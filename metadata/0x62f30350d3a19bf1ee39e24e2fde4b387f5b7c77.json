    "description": "None of these elements were intended to be a cohesive art piece. \n\nThey were initially separate designs that ended up developing organically as one.\n\nThe most cherished art does not always develop through a plan or with much cognitive thought, but is rather poured from the soul and channeled from something much larger.\n\nI cherish this piece with all my heart as its development carried me through the most transformative period of my life.\n\nIt is my representation of the Garden of Eden.\n\nWe are going places - get in the car.\n\nMy genesis NFT.",
