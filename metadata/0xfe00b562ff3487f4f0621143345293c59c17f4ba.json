    "description": "My work aims to translate the aesthetic of classical paintings to the language of photography\n\nBy combining the best of the past with the possibilities of the present, I hope to create images that are both timeless and modern, and that speak to the enduring beauty and humanity of the human experience.\n\nTrue Sight is a metaphor of subjugation of destiny, perfumed by the passion of roses that bleed at the touch of true sight, the one beyond appearance, the one perceived with eyes wide shut. \n\nFor my inaugural Sloika \"True Sight\" drop I created a Collector`s Edition of limited fine art prints dedicated to my debut on this platform.\n\n\n25 exceptional real life pieces, one for each of the 25 NFT editions in my first Sloika drop, making sure that you, the collector, receive the best of each world.\n\nAs the owner of the NFT, you will hold the right to claim the physical artwork at any time. The option to claim is not a requirement and can be available indefinitely until the physical artwork is claimed.\n\nFor details visit: https://www.claudiuguraliuc.com/sloika-collectors-edition",
