    "description": "Amber Vittoria’s abstracted work draws on her relationship to femininity, emotion, and identity. This is Vittoria’s first collection with MoonPay. The collection consists of 100 artworks inspired by her poem, “Untitled / Unlabeled, / Morphing / As I’m able.” Some of these artworks will be 1/1, 1/15, or 1/30 editions, totalling 1530 NFTs. All NFTs will be minted as a hidden mint. The NFTs will be revealed after 24 hours. These artworks are indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artist Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.",
