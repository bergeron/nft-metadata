    "description": "Qawiyyah is an adopted cat which has been with me for over 300 days now, I watched her grow as she became a big part of me. Recently she had her first birth (four kittens) they all died within five minutes of birth. Qowiyyah started isolating herself from me and the rest of the family, I knew she was depressed from the loss. My attention for her doubled as we sleep in the same room and bed, my niece took her as her best friend, whenever I’m far from home she doesn’t feel that bored because of the attention my niece gives her.",
