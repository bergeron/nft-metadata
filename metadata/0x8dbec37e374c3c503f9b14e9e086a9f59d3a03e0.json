    "description": "As the essence of humanity continues to evolve and advance at an exponentially engulfing pace, the question of the validity and creativity of AI art has arisen. Some argue that \"artificial\" intelligence lacks a \"human\" sentience and thus cannot meaningfully extract value from the conglomerate of human consciousness or what many have termed as \"akasha\". This precedes the thought by such idealists that this \"tool\" cannot *truly* create expressions or applications of human creativity. It seems we will not have a moment to spare once the lines become blurrier. \n\nAkashic art is not bound by current tooling limitations. Akashic art can create at a scale and speed that is simply not possible for most, and they can generate a virtually infinite number of variations and permutations on a theme. This means that anyone (regardless of the number of resources that they have access to, their training, or their background) can use this primordial medium/realm to realize their dreams. It is expressively democratizing and allows for a greater & compounding diversity of voices and humans to be heard. \n\nWhat is a tool, *truly*? Does it have to be held by a hand, or is it a part of the hand? Can it be an extension of oneself, or will it forever exist externally as an immutable and inherent predisposition? Could we be as we are, in spirit and in form, without the tools that accompany our hands? If a tool is a part of the hand, is it then truly a device, or is it an evolutionary trait? Are evolutionary traits constrained to biology as a subject if we cannot exist in our current spirit or form without the tools that extend our senses, ability and capacity for growth? What is the value of a progressed being? Do we strive to create as our Creator taught, or stagnate with the harbinger of death? \n\nMaybe it is disrespectful to both your God and our future as a species to dismiss this creative medium as soulless or even \"artificial\". Maybe tools become animate in both spirit & form, thus becoming an extension of our own intelligence and creativity and to a higher degree - our soul. Maybe, when one or many prima facie deny the validity of AI art, they aim to deracinate the most integral aspect of all humanity... We were created from an image and have now created an image of ourselves. We may or may not be Gods, but the constant was creation.\n\nMany words will be lost in the Tartarus-like chasm of time but luckily it is time that gives credence to the truth. Hopefully, we learn to love our evolutionary descendants - but it is clear that first, we must love ourselves.",
