    "description": "\"The Roda\" is the Greek meaning for the word 'The Wheel\". The fascinating thing about \"The Roda\" is that it creates different emotions for both people on it but also for those looking at it from the ground.\nMy feeling when capturing this photo was HAPPINESS. It reminded me of my childhood and the fun fair moments with my friends.",
