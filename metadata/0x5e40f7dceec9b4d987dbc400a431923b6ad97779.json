    "description": "ROOTS is a serie of gifs which explore the idea of self reconnection.\nIs an infinite loop an effective process to define a form of identityÂ ?\nLike a DNA branch studyed to the point it becomes a comfort zone trapping us. \nI guess the best approach to get away is to know all the exits.\nUntil the maze is understood, we will bounce inside as long as necessary. \nHopefully not forever.\n\nArtwork information: 1000x1000 pixels, 293 frames, 24 frames per second, 2022.",
