    "description": "Captured in Silver Bay, Minnesota \nAugust 4th, 2020\n\nAs the collection name suggests, this beach is quite unique as the \"sand\" is black. Caused by the pollution of taconite tailings from mining decades ago. (In my following mint you'll be able to see the \"sand\")\n\nA group of friends and I planned a road trip to visit northern Minnesota, this was one of our stops. Everything there fit so well, the clear water, big cliffs, and vibrant leaves. I'm not quite sure what birds populate the area but there was a whole flock of them, after a few attempts I managed to grab this shot. \n\nAs it was soaring through the sky I thought: \"how nice would it be to fly without a care in the world, live stress-free, and go anywhere you want.\" \n\nBy no means do I consider myself a photographer, I’ve never taken any classes for it. It’s just a hobby I enjoy, taking polaroid pictures. Capturing a memory using instant film gives a “nostalgic & vintage” feeling.\n\n\n\n",
