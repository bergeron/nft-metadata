    "description": "I am interested in how this project causes a transfer of private emotion to the viewer/a broader audience. This project came to be during my residency in Maine/USA in the summer of 2009 when I was there for 2 months, surrounded by chosen artist in pure nature. I have wanted to make a project on waiting, about the process and time, on questioning ideas and reflections such as art and love. At that time I was thinking a lot about works of Felix Gonzalez-Torres. I was filming myself (from behind) gazing at the lake every day for 40 min (this daily process was very important ). Among the footage of about 48 hours there was this image - \"Blue\". In this image, in that particular moment, in that particular second - the \"blue\" just came out surrounding my figure, probably caused by a malfunction of the camera and different light coming in.",
