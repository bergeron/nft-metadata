    "description": "Far away in the remote corners of the Indian Himalayas lies a valley named Spiti. The name originates from a river that flows through and brings life to the entire valley. It gets extremely cold in winter, with temperatures dipping to -25C for weeks before slowly returning to normal. \n\nI was fortunate enough to visit the place at a time when Winter has just set in. Fresh snow adorned the entire valley, and the river was just beginning to freeze. The entire place looked like a fairytale with the river being half frozen, and the turquoise water flowing through the sheets of ice.",
