    "description": "In 2015 I fell in love with photography. It drew me in like nothing I have ever felt before. The life I was preparing for up to that point in my studies at college suddenly felt foreign, like that future didnâ€™t belong to me. This image is from the first model shoot I ever did in California that year. It will always hold a special place in my memory as a transition point. An escape from one life and the discovery of another. \n\nUpon reaching 20 collectors of my SuperRare artworks, this collector's edition will be awarded to the current 20 holders of those works.",
