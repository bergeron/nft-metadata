    "description": "The theme of this work is \"returning to the origin\".\nWhy does she use spray art to paint a muscular rice ball god? It is because she originally liked to draw muscle-bound macho men.\n\nBut the public appreciated her idol cuteness and was not interested in her creations. She herself decided to behave according to that demand. And it paid off, as she was loved by many and received glowing praise from the public. However, she lost sight of what she really wanted to do.\n\nShe turned away from the glorious world and once again painted a picture of a macho man in a dark back alley. The result was a masterpiece, more divine than anything she had ever painted before. But she weeps. But she weeps, because she knows that this painting is not appreciated or wanted by the world.\n\nShe will accept the reality and go back to the glorious world.\nBut the memories of the past will not disappear. She will remember the past again and again to gain strength and fight the harsh reality once again.\n",
