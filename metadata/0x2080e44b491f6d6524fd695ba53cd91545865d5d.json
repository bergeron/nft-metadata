    "description": "Welcome to these dark and obscure places, explorers.  \nIf you are here, it is because you are brave. Or desperate. \n\nIn order to explore new worlds, you must be prepared to go to the deepest places. The best hidden. Those shadowy places beneath the earth.  \nThat's what the Cassiopea ship was created for. \n\nInspired by the \"Upside-Down\" jellyfish, this craft is always pointing downwards. It is able to soften or solidify part of its structure in order to infiltrate the narrowest crevices. \nIts extendable arms constantly analyse and study the surrounding environment, while ensuring increased stability. \n\nJPEG file - 6580x10000",
