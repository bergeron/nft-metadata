    "description": "I stumbled across this Redtail Hawk shortly after getting off the MARTA train in Atlanta and this chance meeting lit a fire in me to create more Audubon photography. This bird paid me no attention and was near motionless while surveying the train tracks below searching for rodents but I will remember it forever.\n\nCaptured on June 26 2018",
