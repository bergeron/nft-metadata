    "description": "Do you love trees? I love. I also love to experiment creatively. I made a deliberate mistake in this picture. I closed the aperture to 45 and set the shutter speed to one second. It turned out a little dark and I pulled the exposure a little in Lightroom. It turned out something smeared and blurry. So what? I took a closer look and I was drawn in. What is art anyway? Our NFT is essentially art?! The tree has lost its image, on the one hand, but on the other, it has acquired a new one. I liked this image, so I'm posting this NFT.",
