    "description": "I often get nostalgia from looking at lights through rain soaked windows.\nWhen I was younger I was captured by the dispersion of light through the droplets, moving water. I was especially captivated by the scenes of nights in the cities through rainy windows. \nAs I get older I have held on to these feelings of wonderment, and try to capture these scenes when I am able...for nothing more than to go back to those nostalgic feeling when I think I may need them.\nI will continue to shoot these amazingly dynamic and complex scenes  of a world that is ours but slightly off, in some loose attempt to capture the art in this world that we often look past...or through.",
