    "description": "Nothing can mar the clarity of thought and the purity of the soul like intense Anger. He who is angry does nothing as he should because he cannot think straight. Therefore, he resembles people who have lost the ability to reason because of damage to their senses. Anger can be compared to a strong, all-consuming fire that scorches the soul, damages the body, and makes even the very sight of a person unpleasant.\n\nEdition: 1/1  \nSize: png, 4000 × 6000",
