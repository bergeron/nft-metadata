    "description": "In between her military campaigns, Joan of Arc had to make sure her troops were fed. She time traveled to the modern supermarket where an abundance of food could be found. The endless aisles of food, bright colors, and smells overwhelmed her, but she was determined to feed her troops. While some onlookers gave weird stares, most assumed she was nothing more than a dedicated cosplayer. She struggled with the modern self-checkout, but managed to get through with a little help.",
