    "name": "THE LIVING GOD -  KANDANNAR KELAN",
    "description": "On this day he is not a human, he is a God. Its a must watch fire Theyyam. The theyyam runs through fire. People can only watch the dangerous perfomance of theyyam by holding their breath.\n\n  Kandanar Kelan was a yesteryear warrior. The story goes that once Kandanar Kelan was out hunting in the forest when suddenly the forest caught fire. Finding no other means of escape he climbed a tree where it was home of two snakes. The fire consumed the tree, the snakes and Kandanar Kelan. Vayanat Kulavan, another warrior god was passing by the burnt forest when he saw the image of Kandanar Kelan in the ashes. With his bow he traced out Kandanar Kelan and gave back his life. The theyyam is an embodiment of the Kandanar Kelan and how he shows his anger towards the fire for burning him up.The theyyam very prominently has two snakes drawn on his chest that depict the snakes that perished with him in the fire. Kandanar Kelan runs through the fire dressed in his silk and wearing metal anklets.\n\n",
