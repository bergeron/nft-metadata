    "description": "2022\n\nI'm the creator of my world. I am a child of my world. Welcome! Saturated colors, bright emotions, honesty and a lot of inspiration.\n\nThe fetal position is the pose at the moment before the birth of the baby. This child of nature is born in a great world with beautiful landscapes, sunsets, oceans, architecture, emotions, sensations and wants to try them all. We are all born without clothes, prejudices, social patterns and censorship. We just want to be free.\n\n\nI'm doing this photo performance for the second time. The first one was in 2020. The goal is to completely merge with my paintings because art is my world.",
