    "description": "I wrote this song on May 24th 2022, the day of the Uvalde tragedy. I never planned to release it, I just needed somewhere to try and make sense of my emotions. \n\nThis was during the lowest period of my life to date, when I could go days without getting out of bed, just watching the leaves fall from the tree outside my window. The news broke me that day, not that I could ever comprehend the feelings of those affected, but it made me question everything I believe in.\n\nYou can make your own mind up about this song and what it represents, I just invite you to reflect and consider your blessings in this present moment. \n\nThe instrumental is produced by my brother in arms Adam, who you will be hearing a lot more of from here on out. It is my pleasure to welcome him into our community.\n\nThis song is dedicated to all the pure souls taken too soon. Thank you for listening <3",
