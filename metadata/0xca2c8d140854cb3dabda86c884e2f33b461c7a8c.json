    "description": "Every Moment is a generative algorithm that aims to capture the feeling of fleeting moments in one's life. Geometry follows a central curving line that bisects the artwork, matching the ups and downs. This composition represents a timeline through which the pieces are all journeying through. Each piece then becomes a moment, some high, some low, each adding to the color of one's history.\n\nThe project combines geometric shapes and patterns commonly found in James's artwork with 35mm film effects.\n\nReleased in the Unit London exhibit entitled \"Building Blocks\" - 2023.",
