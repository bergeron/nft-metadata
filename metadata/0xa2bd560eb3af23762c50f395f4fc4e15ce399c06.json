    "description": "\"Reconstruction\" Rudolf Polanszky has used as a generic term for certain outputs of his production. The emblematic blue hook with a wedge on the left could be even read as the letter, with which begins this term and the surname of the artist. The floating way of the representation, the seemingly coincidental constellation counteract the solidity of the material. The twisted piece of copper on the right, which answers to the blue sign or hook on the left, sticks out of the collage. It looks more like a harvesting tool than a letter. One gets the feeling, that on a sublevel there is an ongoing transformation, and that the surface of this work shows a moment of this ongoing struggle. To express himself means for this true avantgardist Polanszky of course to invent his own language.",
