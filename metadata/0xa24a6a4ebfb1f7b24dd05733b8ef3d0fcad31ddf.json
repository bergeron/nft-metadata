    "description": " As an aviation enthusiast, I have always been fascinated by abandoned airplanes and the stories they hold. After weeks of travel, I stumbled upon a breathtaking sight in Arizona - four airplanes, left on an open field by a farm. \n\nI could hardly believe it when I saw the airplanes in perfect alignment and I knew this was an opportunity too good to pass up. I couldn't wait to capture this scene from above with the drone.\n\nA reminder of how beauty can be found even in unexpected places.\n\nArtist: Charles Martinez\n\nTitle: Desert Soar\n\nEdition: 1/1\n\nLocation : Arizona\n\nYear Created : Apr 2018\n\nSize: 2177 x 2721\n\nGear : Phantom 3 Pro\n\nGenre : Aerial Photography\n\nLicense: Primary NFT holder is free to use in advertising,\ndisplay privately and in groups, including virtual\ngalleries, documentaries and essays by holder of the\nNFT, as long as creator is credited.
