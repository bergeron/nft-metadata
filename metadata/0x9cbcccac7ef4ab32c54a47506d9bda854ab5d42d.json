    "description": "'Nikes On My Feet' \nDigital render \n2023 \n\nThis piece was created for Camille's collectors as a free claim. \n\n\"Whole body movement is a new kind of concept I am exploring. As a portrait artist, creating works that consist of shoulders and faces have its limitations. As I have started working with clothing, the idea of movement has become of interest. As much as the face reveals most of the story, so does body language. This piece was created to reflect a youthfulness as the person is jumping in an extremely exaggerated way. ",
