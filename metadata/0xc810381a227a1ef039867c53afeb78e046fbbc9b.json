    "description": "Inspired by the poetry \"Because I could not stop for Death\" by Emily Dickinson, this piece talks about death as comfort that waits for a mortal life when the time comes around. This poetry has always been my favourite, as it gives me a sense of understanding to even look at death as a friend of immortality. This same understanding lead me to create this story and this piece of my vision, where I try to explore the same sentiment with a frame that defines the writer's persona. \n\nWhere the writer herself waited and welcomed the old friend and described the path toward an end of a phase while understanding another unknown step. \n\nLink to her biography - https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/emily-dickinson\n\nTeam credits - Jophin, Anvesha and Lubaba",
