    "description": "Presented at the exhibition “Electric Mannerism” at GAD Giudecca Art District (Venice), Scalo Lambrate (Milan) and JD Malat Gallery (London) in collaboration with MoCDA Museum of Contemporary Digital Art, the series \"Impossible Sculptures” by artistic duo ha:ar inspires a sense of wonder and disbelief in the beholders. No. 27 is a computer-generated image featuring bodies in mystical poses surrounded by thick clouds reminiscent of Baroque representations of the Christian Judgement Day. The surfaces in these works recall a combination of traditional materials and plastic or chromed metal. The compositions push the beholders to get lost in the maelstrom generated by the intertwining of the bodies with the surrounding material, like individuals who find themselves in the eye of the storm. The attention shifts from one element to another, allowing the beholder to find connections and relationships without any evident direction provided by the artists.\n",
