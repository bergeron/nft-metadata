    "description": "Music Inspires me the most to create. MF DOOM is one artist I unfortunately never got to work with before his passing. What I love most about his music is his loose, raw & abstract style. These directly inspired the creation of this piece. I worked with the upcoming producer 'MO' who supplied his interpretation of an MF DOOM instrumental.  The title 'MF MOOD' is not only a spin on his name but also a nod to his gritty timeless energy that lives on through all his fans. RIP DOOM ",
