    "description": "Jani Leinonenâ€™s foray into the world of scarce digital art with his first NFT drop, an exclusive collaboration with Swappable for the opening launch auction.\n\nHave we become more consumers than citizens? Our values, our political views, our emotions, traumas, and our dreams, are revealed by this sacred shopping cart. When we take a look at this portrait of us, how much do we recognize as our own? Will there truly be a new better world displacing the established and old, or will we forever be owned by the things we own?",
