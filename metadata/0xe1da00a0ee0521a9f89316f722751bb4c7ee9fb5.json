    "description": "Longing back when once alive\nThat warm embrace of love in truest faith\nMany said they care for him\nMany said there was love for him\nFalsehoods they were of a devilish manner\nCaring more of the Victorian sweet grandeur\nNot the heart that once beat within his chest\nNot the soul who longed for loves embrace\nAlone he had stayed til the very end\nAlone he was even after the end\nHis afterlife as lonely as living\nHis eternal soul always seeking forgiving\nHis heart now laid within the clock\nLonging true love with each tick and each tock\nWould it ever come in its truest form\nWould he ever finally experience that love and that care\nThe ghost had wondered and pondered his days longing to get to feel that way\nWithin his spirit he still felt a heart\nEven though his body did depart\nEternally waiting and seeking his love\nA love both true and virtuous in wake\nMany a millennia had past since the day his spirit and body had been so awake\nNow his place and his heart was so much in dismay\n\nNicholas Spandre",
