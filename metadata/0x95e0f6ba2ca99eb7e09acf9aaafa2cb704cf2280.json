    "description": "\"A shattered self, forgotten fragments\"\n\nIn grade 5 I got caught shoplifting and it shattered my relationship with my family. Losing a stable foundation at that age had lasting impacts that I didn't understand until recently.\n\nI feel like there are parts of myself that are stuck in the past, fragments that won't reattach. \n\nThe sketch for this piece came to me intuitively and it reminded me of this issue that I have been grappling with. Working on the piece has been therapeutic and I have a feeling that I'm not the only one that has felt this way.\n\nThank you for letting me share my story! ^-^",
