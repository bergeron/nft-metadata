    "description": "One of the 444 first series of Apologetic Astronaut. Some say we are pretty unlucky, we live in the age where the earth has been explored but the true space exploration hasn't started yet. When i was a kid i had a dream to be an astronaut. This was 25 years ago. But I live in a country does not have any space program. 25 years later, it seems we are in a restart of space exploration. Apologetic Astronaut is a hope and dream that we will experience the true space exploration in our very short lifetime.",
