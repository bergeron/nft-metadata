    "description": "Agents are fully rigged 3D models. You will be able to use them like any other 3D avatar beyond it’s A.I. functionality. Almost all assistants right now like Siri/Alexa are voice based, however, Nanoverse Agents have personality modules and physically reside on your PC’s desktop. This is an entirely different concept and; they’re something that you can truly connect with on a personal level.",
