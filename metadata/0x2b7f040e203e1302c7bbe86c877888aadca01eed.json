    "description": "The early morning on the slopes of Elbrus (5,642m). A solitary climber crosses the 5,100 meter mark on the way to the summit. He is plagued by extreme fatigue, symptoms of altitude sickness, and a wind so strong that it feels he would certainly take flight should he spread his arms wide enough. Each step is a struggle, and each meter of his path is a harsh test. But he continues to climb, despite everything, defying odds. This is a true power of the human spirit.\n\nYear: 2009\nMountain: Elbrus\nDimensions: 4000x2660 px\nLicense: Extended Editorial\n",
