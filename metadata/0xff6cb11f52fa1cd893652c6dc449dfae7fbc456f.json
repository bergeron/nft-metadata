    "description": "Finished is a hand glitched fiber based mixed media scanograph that explores the complexity of the human psyche, and where we draw the lines within ourselves.\n\nThrough the use of brightly painted and sewn papers, threads, and spray painted gold toy soldiers, this piece seeks to represent the relationships we have with various parts of ourselves that both fight with, and support us.\n\nWhen the image is enlarged, the glitches become more prominent, revealing the intricate rainbows that emerge from the chaos and reveal the beauty that exists within us, even in the midst of turmoil.
