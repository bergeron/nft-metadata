I wrote it after my wife and I experienced a miscarriage late in her pregnancy. Shortly afterwards I had to leave her back home in Virginia to do some work out in California. Sitting on the balcony of my hotel in Cali, It seemed like everything hit me at once and I felt guilty for being 3000 miles away. \n\nI began to write which has always been my form of self therapy. I ran through the ringer of emotions including sadness, anger, and confusion. Thus these verses were born. I sat on this song for a while until my friend Jay Real provided this hook. I felt like it went perfectly with my verses, and the melody took me back to that time.\n\nLife really is a rollercoaster and we have to understand that. Always pray for good times, but understand that there will be bad times so pray for the strength to deal with them.\n\n\n\nWritten by: Twenty Duce and Jay Real\nProduced by: Gum$\nArtwork by: Twenty Duce",
