    "description": "The North Breakwater lighthouse silhouetted in the harbor at Duluth, MN.  Each image in this collection is symbolic of what I was experiencing in my own life  battling cancer - and in the years after surviving - being left with anxiety and stress disorders. This silhouette represented how I felt, standing alone fighting these battles - in the spotlight as others watched, but very alone at the same time",
