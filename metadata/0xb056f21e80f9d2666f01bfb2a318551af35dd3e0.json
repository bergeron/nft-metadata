    "description": "I escaped the bright lights of Las Vegas to watch the Super Blood Moon Eclipse rise over the red rocks in the desert with close friends. As we drove out, the fiery sky was a dwindling memory in our rear view mirror.\n\nLittle did I know, those amazing clouds we were driving away from would be the frame for my panorama as I captured my images in the fading light. The eye of my camera saw colors in the sky my eyes could not and I was blessed with dreamy cotton candy clouds and indigo skies.\n\nBeing able to spend some quality time with dear friends and also create this image that will go on the wall of Desert Moon Wellness as a mural will always make this night so special to me. These in real life connections and memories are truly precious and I hold them near and dear to me.\n\nWith their permission, I am minting this as an NFT for the digital space, while their piece will adorn the wall floor to ceiling in the physical space.",
