    "description": "Figure Studies is a series of nude portraits that subverts the viewer’s expectations of the female form. Shot through glass, the images are distorted, even ghost-like. Though strange and unsettling, the forms remain familiar and beautiful. Light finds the bodies in the dark while holding the viewer at arm’s length, as if seen through a veil. \n\nPart of Caitlin Cronenberg’s Figure Studies collection. \n",
