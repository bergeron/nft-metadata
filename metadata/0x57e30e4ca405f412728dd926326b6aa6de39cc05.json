    "description": "'Tears' by SUBCIETY is about knowing when it's time to move on from someone you once loved. Everybody comes into our lives, whether it's for a short period of time or longer, to teach us something important. A lesson. A love. A reflection of our inner being. Admitting this to ourselves is sometimes the most uncomfortable part. The tears we once shed, become the strength we require for ourselves to experience life, with a completely different meaning. Embracing the experience of new moments, with a new perspective and a new approach on love.",
