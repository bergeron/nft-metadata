    "description": "Introducing this FUDker \"Viny L.\" to the ETH Blockchain!  \nViny L. loves to stand, not sit in front of his record player with at least 10 lbs of vinyl's piled up to listen to with his eyes SHUT. Side A, flipped to side B, vinyl after vinyl, Viny L. loves his vinyl's. Also, he thinks Ai music stinks to his ears and so 90% of todays music makers call him a FUDker.\n\nThis is an EDITION version of Viny L. The 1/1 version is in my \"The Neighborhood FUDkers\" collection!\n\nFUDker #1 \"Vinyl L\" in the Neighborhood  \n\"JayJitsu\" Instrumental made on MPC2000XL  \n256x360 px | MP4  \nHip-Hop + Web3 Culture.\n\nJoin the discord: https://discord.gg/uYEuBRsncy",
