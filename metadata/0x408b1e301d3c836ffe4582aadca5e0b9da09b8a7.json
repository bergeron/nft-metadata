    "description": "I grew up with, and was raised by women.\nMy mother, my neighbour- Amma and her daughters. \nApart from school, most of my time was spent under a woman's influence.\n\nMy dad was always working, and even though he loves me and gave enough time to me, \nit was the women in my life who shaped me into a kind and compassionate being. \n\nAlthough I studied in an all boys school, majority of my best friends were and still are female.\nI found my gentler and kinder side with them and for that I am grateful!\n\nThese women taught me lessons.\nLessons of moral integrity and faithfulness.\n\nSociety is of the notion that women are the weaker sex.\nBut day in and day out, all I saw was strength. \nI saw passion.\nI saw primordial energy!",
