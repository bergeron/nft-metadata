    "description": "A face in agony, screaming to free itself from all the weight that current society forces us to carry, but because it has psychedelic colors it does not become aesthetically unpleasant.\nThe vibrant colors and the fluidity of the shapes create a perfect balance in the work.\nInspired by Aztec ceremonial masks, this artwork was generated by A.I (MidJourney) and polished in Photoshop to the desired style.",
