    "description": "This is a physical painting I completed over  a printed canvas.  Focusing is something I wish I could do easily.  Self-discipline in this fast paced world is getting harder to do with so much technology in our faces all the time.  I often wonder how much better I may be at something if I had invested in just a little more time.  No matter how intimidating something may look; if you love something put all of yourself into it.  Play on your strengths and the rest will come naturally.  ",
