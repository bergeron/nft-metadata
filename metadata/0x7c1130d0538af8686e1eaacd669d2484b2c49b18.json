    "description": "During my first month living in California circa 2020, I stayed in a private bedroom of an Airbnb in a small Asian town called Rowland Heights. It was peaceful for the most part, filled with lots of hiking trails, outlet malls, beautiful suburban homes and apartments etc. The family we stayed with were really kind people and if I remember correctly, the mother was an artist herself although I didn't witness anyone painting other than myself. This trail was accessible from the back of the house, and I soon found myself walking this trail very often at sunlight. It became one of my favorite activities during the few weeks we stayed here until my group and I found another Airbnb to rent, which was also still in Rowland Heights.",
