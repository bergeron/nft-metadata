I’ll pick that one.\n\nIt’s shit  \nHmmm, nope that one is shit too  \nOn and on until we’ve reviewed all the images from a session. As an artist if anyone was to ask me who my toughest critic is. It would be myself. It can always be better. Never happy with the result. 5… 10…. 15… revisions later and maybe the piece is ready to go. Adjust the sliders some more, maybe bring it back to where it was. \n\nMaybe I’ll come back to it in 6 months’ time. Maybe it’s just not the right time to edit this photo. \nThis caption took me half a dozen rewrites but even now I’m not settled on it. But I will mint this photo and be okay with what I have produced…",
