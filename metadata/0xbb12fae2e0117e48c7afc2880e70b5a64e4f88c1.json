    "description": "For the first time in Shahnameh, we hear of Sama, meaning worship with ecstasy, which was performed by Khosrow Kiani, who paid attention to Sama for five weeks. Drunkenness is not in Islamic culture but in the culture of the early Aryans, and it is also found in Jewish culture that David praised God with a harp. It is certain that religious listening and dancing for God has its roots in ancient history.",
