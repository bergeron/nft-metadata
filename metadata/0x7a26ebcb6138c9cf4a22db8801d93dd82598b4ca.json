    "description": "\"This is a collection of images taken between 2017 and 2020, many of which were taken in between moments - a rest stop,  a chance encounter; en route to someplace else. In hindsight, the someplace else is usually a disappointment -  it serves only as a beacon or as a natural conclusion to an activity. In reality, the bit in between the A to B is where the magic is, the bit we donâ€™t have an alphabet for. It was difficult to name this project, as many of these images are not often related, either geographically or conceptually but what they all share in common is that they were all captured on the way to another place to do something else or as a natural rest stop of varying length. These images live in a kind of limbo, neither here nor there, but they are seemingly everywhere, funny moments of serendipity, or perfect light and complimentary colour just waiting for someone to cast their eyes on them.\" - Ian Howorth\n",
