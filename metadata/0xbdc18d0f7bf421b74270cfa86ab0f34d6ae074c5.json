    "description": "This freaky boy is Baby Joker, he was just a little baby doll, with a kind cute face, that kids loved to play with\nHis story begins with pain!\nwhen he was trapped in the Magician's Dungeon, struggling to free the poor kid from the Magician's cruel hands, he got cursed by the Magician and lost his big eyes\nhe was no longer able to see!\nbut after the 11th week, he found a magical card that was made by the Magician to do evil stuff and murder the kids\nHe finally killed the Magician with a swing of the card and got away from the dungeon\nDeath, he named the card\nHe tried so hard to forget the child, but every night, the city could hear him cry, a weeping sound that doesn't stop when a kid is alone in the park\nThe Baby Joker just couldn't stop himself from crying, so he sewed his lips\nsuch a hurtful pain he couldn't bare\nHe's got a dead heart inside his cold body now, which makes him follow you in the darkness\nTo hunt you down and slice ur sanity with a swing of his card.\n...",
