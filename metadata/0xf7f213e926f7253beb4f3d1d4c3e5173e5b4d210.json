    "description": "\"Doubt\" captures self doubt, where you are your biggest critic and your worst judge. \n\nThe painfull thoughts and words you tell yourself are the ones that take the color and the life out of you. Like an ugly bug coming out of your mouth and wandering on your own face to remind you of the bad things  you try to convince your self. Moments like these take the shine out of you and spread the fade wherever those words land. they blind you! cover your sight from all the beautiful things you can do and have. \n\nBut always... ALWAYS! have your consciousness hold you back from believing in those negative thoughts, bringing you to reality where you know you are worth it, where you know you can do better, where you know that you just still not there yet, where you should be, where you WILL be!\nTake your own hand to help you rise from what your mind has set you up to believe in, and remember: whatever you believe about yourself on the inside is what will reflect on you and your work on the outside",
