    "description": "Flower Sand is a collection consisting of 100 moving image works. It explores vibrant colours and fluid movements inspired by nature, using AI-generated imagery and motion simulation. Using leading generative AI models, the generated AI flowers are diverse as well as sophisticated. Repurposing them with fluid particles results in generative sculptures. The work depicts the beauty of nature generated by algorithms, representing our connection to the natural world in the age of artificial intelligence. In addition, this work lets the viewer reflect on critical questions in such an age encompassing collective creativity and ownership.",
