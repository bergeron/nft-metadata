    "description": "Since the age of 5 years old my dad had me using a Roland MS 1 sampler i’ll never forget that day sitting on the edge of the couch using it and me pressing the pads to hear my voice say “yeah baby”.\n\nFrom that day, I knew what I wanted to be in life… which was to be like my father. From seeing him drawing every day,  doing animation, photography, and making music he is the greatest artist I know. The beauty of it is he’s all self-taught.\n\nThis release, it’s a tribute to my Parents. From the hand-drawn cover, to the music, to the sounds that are in the music. Without my parent's support and encouragement, I wouldn’t be here today. In the beat there's half of a speech from my friend saying to follow your dreams and goals and that's something my parents always told me and supported, at the end, she says I miss you chow chow, and as I moved to another state that's how I always feel, I will always miss them but I know that they are right here with me always cheering me on to keep going.\n\nThis body of work is my whole life, as I drew myself on the cover floating holding a sampler/drum machine from my dad and the records from my mom floating around me … this is 3 summers.",
