    "description": "I have been through series of stages in the course of life. This current stage stands out. It's a phase of the redefinition of who I am among billions of souls that walk the face of the earth. Like many people, all I wanted was to truly live and not just exist. For me, this  \ncontinues to beg the question, \"what\" exactly am I? From where does my meaning come?\n\nI paused and realized that I Am Gold  \nI am a symbol of immortality and power  \nA mark of nobility and strength  \nGold is not what describes me  \nGold is who I am\n\nYou may want to know that there are gems more priced than Gold, but still, there is not one in all history, that is ever been believed to be of \"the greatest value\" but Gold.\n\nIf I never knew what I was, I still will be Gold, just without the knowledge of it.",
