    "description": "Self Portrait is my first work at the FOUNDATION. After turbulent periods because of Covid, deprived of the conviviality of friends, family, work colleagues, and also deprived of concerts (I am a singer and musician in the indie rock group Sons of Mercury), I have reached the age of 40.\nDuring this period I was also introduced to NFT and all the possibilities that it can provide for art. And this was fundamental to keep me mentally balanced and to express myself. I met other artists, made friends, took courses, and am still evolving in this new and unexplored universe.\nSelf Portrait brings a bit of these feelings, a bit of my inexperience (still) with the digital format, but expresses exactly how I feel now. Looking for a form, grouping colors, words, grouping myself. This is a work of celebration, of congratulation, of a reboot.\nI used an X-Pen Pro for drawing and painting, mixing it with brushes and textures created in Photoshop.\n",
