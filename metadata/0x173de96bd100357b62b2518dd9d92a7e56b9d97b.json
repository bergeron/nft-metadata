    "description": "TCN (The Cryptofiliate Network) is creating the largest alpha network that has ever existed in the crypto space.\n\n Investors - If you knew that hundreds of the top callers and influencers in the industry were about to call a particular token or NFT project, would you want to know about it?  Of course!\n\n Callers - Would you like it if up to 66% of the taxes on any token was given back to you for all of the volume you bring in?  Better yet, would you like it if you got up to 66% of all of the taxes of EVERY project, whether or not you even called it?!  Of course!\n\n Developers - Would you like it if you could put your project in front of hundreds of thousands of people who have the incentive to not only buy your token, but shill it like crazy?  Of course!\n\n Welcome to TCN!\n\nTCN NFT Collection - 12% gold/legend; 8% red/rare; 7% white/common",
