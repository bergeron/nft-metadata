    "description": "For Fortune Magazine’s 2021 August/September issue focused on cryptocurrency and defi, I was honored with the unique opportunity to design the magazine’s cover and dedicate this to the crypto twitter community which has given so much to me. Fortune and I will be donating 50% of the proceeds to charity.\n\nFor the auction, we’re collaborating with Manifold to create custom smart contracts specifically for this drop. How will it work?\n\nThis NFT is coded to react to a certain list of buyer ETH addresses during its inaugural auction. If a bid comes from one of the buyer’s ETH addresses in this list, the NFT will update to a special edition artwork designed specifically for the target buyer. However, if the bid is outbid by a non-targeted bidder, then the NFT reverts to its original artwork.",
