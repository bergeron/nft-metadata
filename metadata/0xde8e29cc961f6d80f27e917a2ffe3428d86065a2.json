    "description": "The bee was tired, and though I remembered that sugar water helps, my partner was looking it up on the Internet just to be sure. While he looked it up, I had a mini photo shoot with the little bee. Just look at that adorable left foot on the key!\n\nHere he is climbing up onto the key, eventually he was carefully balanced on it. I remember wanting to have him balance on something stable that was short enough for him to get onto. The key seemed like the best solution.\n\nThe hand fan to the left of the bee was something that just happened to be in the car at the time, something that was pure luck. The colors were just perfect and popped, so I had to get the shot.\n\nThe moment that we shared with this bee stands out as one of my top travel moments because it was our chance to help a little being when he was most in need.",
