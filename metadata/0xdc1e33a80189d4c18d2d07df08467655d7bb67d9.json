    "description": "Created from assorted Patagonia catalogs, this work explores the tension between capitalism and nature. Though the landscape appears realistic, they are in fact artificial constructions that have no exact parallel in the natural world. The work questions the very definition of \"nature\" and the idea of preserved or \"untouched\" outdoor spaces which often share a similar level of forced creation or re-imagination.",
