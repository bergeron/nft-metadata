    "description": "The \"carrelets\" are built mainly in the second half of the 20th century on the banks of the Saint-Estèphe estuary, France. To this day, some fishermen in the area continue to use them as fishing huts.\n\nFor this shot I spent weeks studying hanging meteorology to find the perfect day and light to do this long exposure where the reference point is centered with the sky for added visual impact.\n\nArtist name: Adrià Lleixà Bel\nEdition 1/1\nDate Captured: 04/02/2016\nLocation: Saint-Estèphe, France\n\n",
