    "description": "Swiss \nDeath: 13 June 1782 \nOne of the last to be executed in Europe for witchcraft\nExecuted by decapitation\n\nThis NFT has SOUND, please unmute the preview!\n\nThis piece was created first by instructing AI to create a new image after several other images were fed into the intelligence.\n\nAfter that, deep machine learning was used to give 3 dimensions to the 2d image; a moving head model was used to create the AI animated image\n\nThe voice, then, was generated by machine learning with instructions to use a slight Swiss accent in the interior monologue of Anna; the voice is text to speech\n\nI then edited the whole piece adding Foley and music to the sound mix\n\nTo be clear, the person in this video has never existed; Anna Göldi, however, did; and this video aims to give a voice, a face, and mannerisms, to one brutally executed by judicial murder\n",
