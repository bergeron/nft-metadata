    "description": "\" Words, words, words! So many words! They are wearisome things;\n        and yet people cannot refrain from speaking.\n    No eye has ever surveyed the world and said, “I have seen enough”;\n        no ear has ever listened to creation and said, “I have heard enough.”\nWhat has been, that will be;\n        what has been done, that will be done.\n    Nothing is new under the sun;\n        the future only repeats the past.\n One person may say of some idea,\n        “Pay attention to this; it’s original!”\n    But that same idea has already been expressed;\n        it’s been with us through the ages.\n  We do not remember those people and events of long ago,\n        as future generations will not remember what is yet to come. \" - Ecclesiastes 1:8-11",
