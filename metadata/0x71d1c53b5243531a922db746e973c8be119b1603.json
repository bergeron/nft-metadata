    "name": "Floating Cliff House",
    "description": "As you gaze out at the ocean, your eyes suddenly catch sight of something unexpected: a house hovering in the sky just above a cliff overlooking the sea. The house is made of glass and GRC, creating a stunning visual effect as the light filters through the glazing, casting a rainbow of colors throughout the interior.\n\nAs you draw closer, you notice that all of the furniture inside the house is also floating in the air, as if suspended by some invisible force. The chairs, tables, and sofas all bob gently as the house moves, creating a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nThe glass walls provide an unobstructed view of the ocean below, allowing you to watch schools of fish swim by and waves crash against the cliffs.",
