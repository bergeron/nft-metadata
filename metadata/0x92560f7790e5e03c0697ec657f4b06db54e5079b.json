    "description": "We believe that the world is going well and that tomorrow morning will be the same, but surprisingly, everyone is living in a random way and there is no consistency in their lives.\nI strongly imagined that the world is full of discrepancies in our perception of normalcy.\nTo create the illusion that the parts fit well together, I gave a distortion to the visual by not making the circle a regular circle.\n (Picture by Hori)\n\nI arranged the sounds while imagining that the world, like a factory or a cogwheel, is spinning in the name of society, repeating the same cycle day after day.\nThe rising and setting of the sun expresses the passage of time as if it were a matter of course, through the movement of the melody.\nIn the last part of the piece, where the sounds collide with each other, I imagined the stress of people working in society bursting out.\nI hope you can experience a little dark distortion of the world through these colorful pictures. (Music by coco)",
