    "description": "Death speaks to us and says: \"Fear me! Do not think of me for a moment don't take it off! This dress of flesh, these sparkling eyes, this expression, this smile, your hair, the heart you carry inside and every organ, this beautiful silhouette is an entrusted garment. Your true silhouette is your skeleton and you will return to it. I promise you that. I'll come back for my relic. When? you will never know my future. Don't forget me, so that your soul in the hole he's going to dig himself out of. You came from a hole \nand a hole in the earth is waiting for you again. There is an \"afterlife\" to this. Be afraid! Memento Mori. Don't forget me, I promise I'll come back one day\".",
