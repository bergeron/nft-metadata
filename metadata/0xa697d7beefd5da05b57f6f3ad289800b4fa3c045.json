    "description": "In 1997, a young teen named Jessica begged her parents for Glamour Shots. What she got was Glamour Magic. It took place in a Best Western hotel room in rural Pennsylvania. A husband & wife teamâ€”photographer & stylist. She sat in the styling chair, mortified at the transformation happening before her eyes. She did not know then that these photos, which she hid for years in shame, would one day become her most prized possession. And now they are forever emblazoned on the blockchain.",
