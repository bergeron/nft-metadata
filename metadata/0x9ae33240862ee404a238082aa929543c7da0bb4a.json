    "description": "Amazon Worker Cage shows a model the artist made of a 2016 Amazon patent for a ‘human cage’, a metal enclosure that would transport Amazon warehouse workers around the premises, allowing factory works to integrate with machinery. The image shows a prototype of an unrealised blueprint, complete with the numbers referencing the intellectual property of the patent around it.",
