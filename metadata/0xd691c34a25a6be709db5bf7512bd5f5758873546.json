These works of Art represent the power, elegance, harmony and limitless characteristics of the Sea.   \n\nWith this collection, Simpson Marine becomes Asiaâ€™s first yachting company to create an NFT collection.  Being part of and creating history is not only an honor for me, but I also hope it inspires more Artists to follow their passions.  \n\nThe first collectors are entitled to an amazing set of utilities:  \n\n- A high resolution JPG as a digital asset.\n- Eligibility to use their NFT towards the purchase of a yacht, the value of which will be based on certain terms and conditions.\n- A museum quality print of their NFT signed by Ali G in a 1/1 edition.\n- Access to one VIP event hosted by Simpson Marine (to be proposed individually) .\n- Two premium tickets to a Hong Kong Ballet show in 2022.\n\n\n",
