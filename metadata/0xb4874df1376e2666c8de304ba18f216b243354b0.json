    "description": "Be awake, be alert, be aware.  \nApply full attention to your senses.  \nBe aware of the self. Be aware of the other. Be aware of the other’s awareness of the other.\n\nOne of the more experienced lionesses of the famous Avoca Pride rises from her slumber at dusk. There is a window of a few minutes at sunset where these golden lions ‘glow’ from the ambient sunlight filtering through the bushveld. Patience as well as careful positioning was rewarded with an intense gaze from this wild soul. It’s amazing to me how lions can transition from a state of rest to complete awareness and intense focus within seconds.\n\nShe is awake. She is alert. She is aware.\n\nCaptured in Timbavati, Kruger National Park, 10/09/2019.",
