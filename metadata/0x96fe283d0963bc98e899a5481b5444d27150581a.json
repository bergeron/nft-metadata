    "description": "A sea deity in Greek mythology, son of the Titan gods Pontus (Sea) and Gaea (Earth) whose name means \"wonder\" or \"miracle‚Äù. He was the wonders of the ocean, but his importance was diminished by the emergence of Poseidon, as the sea ruler. Married one of the nymph daughters of Oceanus, Electra. Their children were the Harpies; Iris, goddess of rainbows and divine messenger; and Arke. His full siblings are Nereus, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia, all of whom were believed by the Greeks to be aquatic deities.",
