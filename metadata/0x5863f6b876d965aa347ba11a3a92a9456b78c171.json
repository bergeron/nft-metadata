    "description": "_Pixators_ // In the small town of Millfield, there was a group of young street artists known as the Pixators. They were famous for their intricate and detailed graffiti murals, which adorned the walls of abandoned buildings and alleyways. But one day, they took their art to a whole new level. The Pixators decided to create a massive mural on the old town hall building. They worked day and night, pouring their hearts and souls into the project. They painted for weeks, until the mural was finally complete.",
