    "name": "A Scottish Sunset",
    "description": "Living on the west coast of Scotland, I've always been fond of the beach at sunset. This is where my favourite moments of calm are. On this particular evening, I had travelled to the beach in the hopes of a pastel coloured sky and a place to find some tranquility. The haar on the horizon added an extra layer of mood to this photo, and I had great fun documenting this evening. The haar almost entirely covers Ailsa Craig, the rock in the distance, leaving only the top to pop out. ",
