    "description": "I love black and white photos, they are graphic and minimalistic, but at the same time can perfectly convey the character's mood.\n\nThis photo was taken a few years ago, it was my first photo shoot. I wanted to see a new side of myself. I wanted to feel beautiful, after the difficult breakup with my boyfriend. I looked at the world with apprehension, but at the same time I had hope and faith in a happy future. And so it happened...\n\nPhotographer Ekaterina Predeina  \n2835x4279 px  \n1/1",
