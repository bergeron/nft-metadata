    "description": "This piece is part of a series of self portraits depicting different emotions. Overwhelmed depicts overwhelming and uncontrollable emotion. In this state, emotions are hard to navigate and often escape through an explosion of tears and steam. Creating art like this enables me to express how I am feeling and understand my emotions a little better.",
