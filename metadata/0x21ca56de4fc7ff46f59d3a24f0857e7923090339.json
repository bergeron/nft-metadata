    "description": "The next part of the \"Masters of the Metaverse\" series: \"Fraktional\". An homage to one of the most genuine, amazing humans, group of humans or artificial intelligence I've had the pleasure of knowing - @pak.\n\nDistinct, rebellious and genius like Banksy. Cheeky like Murakami. Craftsmanship like Frank Stella. He who made burning stuff valuable and redefined what it is to own something.\n\nI thought it would only be fitting to juxtaposition the concept of \"ownership\" and \"small pieces merge to a greater whole\" to the rage and addiction that NFTs are and the idea of fractionalizing art/assets. Intermixed with some personal demons and the pleasure of being able to help @pak with some of his projects - even in a very small way. This piece has many layers and hits very close to home.",
