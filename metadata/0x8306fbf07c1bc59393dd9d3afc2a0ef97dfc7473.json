Thematically the collection focuses heavily on circles and was inspired by works from Robert & Sonia Delaunay. Outputs will vary by shape, position, colours, textures & output ratios. The name Apollo was inspired by French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who originally coined the term Orphism with which this collection has close ties.",
