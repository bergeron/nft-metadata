    "description": "In December 2021 I was in Miami for Art Week. I decided I wanted to go to the beach early to see the sunrise and brought my film camera with me. This was the last exposure on that roll of film. The edge of the film got destroyed and you can see the effect it has at the bottom of the frame, however that adds to the beauty, magic and uniqueness of this image. The bird soaring in front of me as the sun is rising behind it through the clouds and the light shimmering and reflecting on the surface of the ocean all made me feel as though I was exactly where I was supposed to be at that moment in time, in perfect sync with the universe.",
