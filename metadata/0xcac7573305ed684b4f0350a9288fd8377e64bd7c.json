    "description": "Many things that occur in life are unfair and often out of our control, including when we fail at something we’ve earnestly worked at, face discouraging set backs, or even go through traumatic life events. What we can attempt to control however is our response to these painful experiences. ‘Embracing Disaster’ illustrates the way I want to respond to all such experiences I face in my own life going forward.",
