    "description": "Project SOS - Sharks: has started with a passion to save our sharks. Their numbers dwindling at a fast rate on the verge of extinction. The majestic sea predators looked upon as evil are most vital to our marine ecosystem. Life in the reefs will slowly disappear without the existence of sharks. Largely being affected due to the aftermath of overfishing or demand for their fins and meat. Let us come together to restore the balance of our seas. Artwork is created by a 13 year old girl who loves nature, drawing and photography. Project SOS - Sharks: is going to be charity focussed with a vision to make a difference.",
