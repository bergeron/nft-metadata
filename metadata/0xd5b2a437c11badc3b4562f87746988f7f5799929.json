    "description": "Weeks before I would be gone for an extended weekend, my orchid started to grow a flower spike. I was beyond excited, I've kept this plant alive for over a year and It had done nothing in that time. The day I was set to leave I could tell the flowers were so close to opening, I've been watching this stem grow up for days and I did not want to miss the moment when it finally bloomed. But I did. I was already running late so I gave the plant one last mist and I was off for a five-day weekend. Once I got back home, these beautiful flowers were the first ones to greet me. I gave them a light mist and I loved the way they looked so I grabbed my camera and started taking photos. While I was photographing, all I could think about was patience. It took a year for this beautiful moment to come and this photo is an everlasting lesson that true beauty takes time.",
