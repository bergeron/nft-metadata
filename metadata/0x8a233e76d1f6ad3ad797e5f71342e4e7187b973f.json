    "description": "The Targa Florio was an event I’ve only heard legendary things about before.  \nNow, I can finally confirm those things I’ve heard were true;  \nThe enthusiasm of the drivers, the heartwarming love of the locals, the breathtaking Sicilian landscapes (not to mention the food) and the unpredictable weather are just few of the things that make this event unique.  \nI loved every single minute of this experience and despite how trivial it may sound, I genuinely can’t wait to do it again.  \nArrivederci Sicilia!\n\nTarga Florio 2022 | #20  \nSicily, Italy - 14/10/2022  \nMedium: Digital  \nEdition: 1/1",
