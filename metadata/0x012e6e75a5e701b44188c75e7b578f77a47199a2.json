    "description": "Portfolio.  \nPhotography collection by Bastien Deschamps\n\nEcdemomania : (n.) \n1. A morbid impulse, or obsession, to travel or wander around.  \n2. A compulsive wandering away from home.\n\nEcdemomania is an ongoing extended photography series started in 2015 which documents years of self-reflection and travel around the world: from Siberia to India, Iran to the United States, Tibet to Australia. But the places are not especially relevant.\n\nThis is a mix of reality and daydream. This is an attempt to map a part of my own psyche and to create a lexicon of my inside world. Ecdemomania is more the story of an inside journey than an outside one. Itâ€™s an invitation to wander and get lost. This ongoing body of work counts so far 400 pictures (selected among more than 100 000 shot).\n\nThe NFT collection is composed of 25 1/1 pieces. With each NFT comes the 1/7 Fine Art print.\n\nAvailable on Foundation.\n\nBe in touch on Twitter : @ecdemomaniak",
