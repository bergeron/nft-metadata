    "description": "A rainy day can make you feel sad, happy, comfortable, or inspired. While a good soaking might change your mood, it can also reinforce how you’re already feeling.\n\nAfter a rain, sunshine usually follows. So, keep you’re head up and be grateful for the life-giving nature of raindrops.",
