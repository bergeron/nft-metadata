    "description": "This is an NFT collection made for people who have been scammed by other NFT projects. Everyone claims they are going to be the next BAYC or Crypto Punks to get people to buy their NFTs. Then they scam everyone, and that isn't RIGHT! -- If you like the art, buy your favorite it and keep it. If you want a 1/1 NFT with your My Rug NFT and your scammed NFT, buy one and join our discord. We will make a NFT incorporating your rug and scammed NFT image. -- You will be able to join a private channel that allows you to get whitelisted for future projects without having to level up. We will bring on NFT projects to do AMAs and tell you about their projects for you to be more informed about what you are buying into without being told have faith and more to come, we going to the moon. -- Disclaimer: we are not a part of BAYC, this is a tribute NFT for being one of the projects people claim they are going to be, then aren't. -- No roadmaps, coins, events. Just art and community. Thats it.",
