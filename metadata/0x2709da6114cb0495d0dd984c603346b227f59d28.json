    "description": "Hi my name is Joshua :) . Pawrlsol is my cathartic output. This project began as a avenue to place musings outside of the band ‘Big Dead’. This art has taken many musical forms since it’s inception, and will continue to. \n\nSomeday we will be again -  \n\nI wrote this song when I was battling to find joy in life without abusing substances. I knew I didn’t want to continue my path but life felt colourless without my crutches. I found myself saying “We will be again”, my former self and my future self would find happiness in life without the help of external sources. I would find the best parts of both of me in the future. (I’m still looking lol)\nThis song has unfortunately not made the cut for my upcoming EP ‘THERMOPOLIUM’ but thought it was too much of a bop to leave on my HD. \n\nI decided to release this song as a sonic introduction to the people who have yet to find my art. But also a homage to my current collectors, and my former self.  \nGolden Egg collector will receive an airdrop of one of my previous releases. (their choice)\nReally stoked to be onboard with sound.xyz and looking forward to connecting with y’all and showing you more of my music <3 ",
