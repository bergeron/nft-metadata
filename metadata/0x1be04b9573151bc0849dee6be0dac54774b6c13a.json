    "description": "When the moon is up, beware her eyes. She might take your soul and run.\n\nMadikken is one of my OCs. I held a DTIYS-challenge, where 24 artists from all around the world participated. I ended up giving away prints to 7 of the artists who entered. \n\nThis is one of her alternative poses. Inspired by Theodor Kittelsen's \"NÃ¸kken\" from 1904. \"Madikken PKQ222\" is created by Norwegian artist PureKimsanity (me). ",
