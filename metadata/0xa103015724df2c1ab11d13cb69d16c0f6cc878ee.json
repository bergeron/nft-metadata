    "description": "I still want  \nTo walk into a crowded room and find a face that feels like home.  \nI still believe  \nAfter all the scars and burns  \nTo find a touch which heals them  \nNot just to the surface but deep within.  \nI still hope  \nTo find a song that describes my soul  \nAs if it was written for me.  \nI still think  \nThere's a beam waiting for me to follow  \nAnd take me to a place I belong.  \nI still look  \nAt the sky every night and look for the answers to the questions in my head.  \nI still write  \nTo pour my heart out to find the perfect words  \nThat expresses how I really feel.  \nI still wonder  \nIf there's anything I'd ever look at and find my eyes shining with joy.  \nI still enjoy  \nThe void the numbness and how the world seems to stop as if it's just me and nothing but everything around me.  \nI still hear  \nThe silence and it still surprises me how comforting it can be.  \nI still see  \nThe beautiful world and the people and their perfect smiles and sorrows they've been hiding behind it.  \nI still feel  \nSo much for everything and everyone but always find myself ineffable.  \nI still love  \nEvery little thing surrounding me the sky the moon the water the trees and the air.  \nThe feeling of being everything and still nothing the feeling to love and be loved.\n\nBeautiful lines by ~ infrequentworks (sanskruti) \n\n1/1 , made in zbrush,photoshop\n\nArtwork By Het Patel",
