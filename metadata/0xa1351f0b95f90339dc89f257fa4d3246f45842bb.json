    "description": "You have a door right in front of you - open it, get inside it and look around. Your eyes will meet, and everything will stop for a minute. Now thereâ€™s only the door that watches, and getting watched: Trinity. You're both the watcher and the watched. And the door is the host, the mother's womb, the holy spirit, or the creating power. And also the endless loop of them all.\n\nThere's a key for each door. The key to this door (artwork) will be sent to the owner of the door via airdrop. \"This is your door and you're holding its key.\"",
