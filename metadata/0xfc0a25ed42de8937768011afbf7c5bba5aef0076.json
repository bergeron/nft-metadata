    "description": "I actually feel a deep personal connection to this particular shot. It was made right after the quarantine struck, when all the studios got closed. I havenâ€™t picked up my camera for a little while back then. My friend has just gone back from France to celebrate my bd. We found some random basement with a small window. I reflected the light off of a nearby mirror and directed some more light to her face with a small lamp that stood on the speaker.\n\n\"Anna\"\n4000x6000px, jpg",
