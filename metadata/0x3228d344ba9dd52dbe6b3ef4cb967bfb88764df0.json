    "description": "**The Black Canvas**\n\nWe love to enhance the landscape with our light-painting art, but sometimes the constraints are too important, and we have to change our minds and perspective. We need to let go of the landscape altogether. Therefore, the environment becomes an enhancer of the light-painting and is present in a more subtle way, by creating a unique reflection that completes the image. These are our black canvas, where we can fully explore our creativity with our lights. Not having to balance, harmonize the colors and adjust the composition according to the landscape, the dark emptiness allows us to focus solely on the light-painting, the simplest source of our art. We then use colors as an expression of our fantasy. Colors we would never use otherwise. Constraints as a source of creativity once again.",
