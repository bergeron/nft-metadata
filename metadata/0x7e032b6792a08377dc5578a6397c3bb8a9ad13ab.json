    "description": "'Goodaz' is a term commonly used in Jamaica to refer to someone who you find attractive, especially physically. However, I thought a woman being a 'Goodaz' should have more to do with her spiritual and mental features rather than her physical features: a woman who is self-aware, keen on spirituality and also focused on success in the material world.  This song was the result.\n\nLyrics (with translation of Patoís [Jamaican Slang])\n\nGyal a how stay so? (Girl, how u stay so?)  \nGyal a how stay so? (Girl, how u stay so?)  \nMi love how u stay (I love how you stay)  \nJah know say mi rate you (Jah knows that I rate you)  \nJah know say mi rate you (Jah knows that I rate you)  \nA it mek mi haffi say (That’s why I have to say)  \nWah mi haffi say? (What do I have to say?)\n\nMy girl yaa Goodaz (My girl you’re a Goodaz)  \nIceberg wah mi cool as (Iceberg’s what I’m cool as)  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat\n\nMy girl yaa Goodaz (My girl you’re a Goodaz)  \nThe light of the world is the worth of a woman  \nYou a say mi fi circle (You say I must circle [come around])  \nMi good as pull up, (I probably pull up)  \nGive you a pull of the purple \nand pull off \nCool as the iceberg  \nYou a Goodaz (You're a Goodaz)  \nTranslation:  \nMy girl you a hol’ medz (My girl you hold meditations)  \nSo zen, focus and a stack (focused and your stacking bread)  \nLove Spirituality,  \nLove get to the bag\n\nGyal a how stay so?  \nGyal a how stay so?  \n Mi love how u stay  \nJah know say mi rate you  \nJah know say mi rate you  \nA it mek mi haffi say  \nWah mi haffi say?\n\nMy girl yaa Goodaz  \nIceberg wah mi cool as  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat\n\nYou always have money stash  \nNutn nuh wrong wit dat (Nothing’s not wrong with that)  \nIndependent girl  \nEvery dollar wah you spend get turn (Every dollar you spend gets turnt [makes a profit])  \nDifferently  \nI can admit I need you  \nI could pledge an allegiance  \nI can go deeper  \nYou know a you mi a feature (You know its you I’m featuring)  \nLike the front page of The Gleaner* \n\nGyal a how stay so?  \nGyal a how stay so?  \nMi love how u stay  \nJah know say mi rate you  \nJah know say mi rate you  \nA it mek mi haffi say  \nWah mi haffi say?\n\nMy girl yaa Goodaz  \nIceberg wah mi cool as  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat  \nYou rock the worl’ when you do dat\n\n* 'The Gleaner' is Jamaica's oldest and most popular newspaper",
