    "description": "Original works:\nAuthor: Juan Cruz Matarin\nYear: 2020\nTechnique: Oilpainting on canvas\nDimensions: 2 x 1.5 m\n\nConexión is the first novel charity art exhibition to be completely tokenized in Latin America. \n\nhttps://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/asset/1099565802775\n\nThe NFTs of each artwork are doubly tokenized and certified in two platforms, atomic hub and foundation: with the support and guarantee of the blockchain network.\nFor the acquisition of the NFTs, it is done by: https://foundation.app/@artmatarin\n\nOwner of his own original style, generating unexpected sensations.\nIts technical resources (both in medium and supports) challenge and melt the traditional use of colors and figures; both in pastel charcoal pencil and oil paintings.\nAs in a trance, he is a “revelation artist”, he can give the observer the feelings of space and time in each stroke, and his figures impregnated with symbolisms are a portal between the visible and the invisible.\n",
