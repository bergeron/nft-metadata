    "description": "Bob is a filling station attendant coot, former billy big rig. Single since… well, since forever. Scored a few chicks but relationships are not his cup of tea. We are still curious about Cindy’s whereabouts though.\nBob is not nice and definitely not smart. At fourteen he completed 4th grade with straight A’s, but he was passionate about distilling southern poison from tater by then. So as an elementary school dropout, he started his own business. Which did lasted as long as his relationships. To be honest, he is a grumpy, cantankerous dude.\nHe just loves being a southern stallion. Eating spam with an axe, filling the trunk with gas or blast fishing as a matter of fact. He develops new skills day by day to become the ultimate hillbilly of the beautiful state of The heart of Dixie.\nAnd guess what? He is a massive Golden boy fan with an impressive collection of collectibles, dern tootin. And yes, he puts them on too.\nBob is an interesting man to be loved more than he does death penalty.",
