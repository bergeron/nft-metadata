    "description": "I was inspired to create this art by the idea that each person has his own path, destined as if by some higher powers. Hence the hand that appeared as if from nowhere, from the boundless space of the universe and prompts the right direction. This path leads to the heights of self-development and self-realization.\nThe pieces in chess are as different as people: someone is energetically bright (I put humanity, self-development, spirituality into this), someone is dark (selfish, selfish, cruel).\nEach person lives according to his role. All this is a game by the rules, so I do not humanize the figures, they remain faceless and simply symbolize society as a whole, and individual representatives in particular.\nThere are also fallen characters who could not stand life's circumstances.\nAnd of course, in the picture there was also a tit - a symbol of freedom, without which it is simply impossible to become oneself.",
