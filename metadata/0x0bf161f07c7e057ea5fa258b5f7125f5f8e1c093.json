    "description": "\"Happiness\" exists everywhere.\nIt is not as easily found as a bright flower, but as small as a seed.\n\nWe can find it in the cracks of the days,\nin the shadows of back alleys,\nin yawning kittens,\nin swaying grass,\nin bubbles coming from somewhere.\n\nThat varies from person to person. And we have many overlapping answers.\nIt represents the contours of our hearts and is important for us to understand each other.\n\nMay your heart be at peace.\nEverything will be fine.",
