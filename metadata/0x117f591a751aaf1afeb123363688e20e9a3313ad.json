    "description": "In 1993, when the internet was first becoming available to the general public, I drew two dogs (whom I later named Ricky and Sadie), who discovered, as they put it, \"on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog\".  Now that cryptography and Web3 have shown glimpses of a solution to the identity problem, this immutable NFT of Ricky and Sadie will one day serve as a memorial to when identity on the internet was still a problem.",
