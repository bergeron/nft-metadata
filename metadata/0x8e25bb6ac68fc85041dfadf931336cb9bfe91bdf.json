    "description": "Virtual Slumpies are quasi-utilitarian digital sculptures by Jillian Mayer for use in the metaverse. This work of cyber furniture is the perfect spot for your avatar to rest while you engage with the physical world.\n\nIf you're interested in an IRL Slumpie, try this one out in mixed-reality spaces, VR or AR before purchasing a physical copy (sold separately as a post-posture solution for our physical bodies).\n\n[Perez Art Museum](https://www.pamm.org/exhibitions/jillian-mayer-slumpies)\n[Ofelia Plads](https://artillerymag.com/jillian-mayer-slumping-around/)\n[Website](https://www.jillianmayer.net/slumpies-1)",
