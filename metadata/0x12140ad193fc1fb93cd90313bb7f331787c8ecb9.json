    "description": "Seoul is one of the biggest cities in the world. Living here has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. \n\nA person finds himself lost in this massive city where he's surrounded by all these technological advancements and fast-paced life. If he isn't able to catch up with all of it - he feels left out. Fear of missing out will take over and he'll have doubts and questions about himself for which he seeks answers. No answer within sight keep him hesitant all night. On those dark nights, the rain pours down and covers the ground, reflecting the light above and creating a mood from a Sci-Fi movie. He finds himself lost in that moment. There he sees a person seeking shelter under an umbrella and he instantly encapsulates that moment in his camera and seeks inspiration from those Isolated Souls walking down the road for when he himself becomes an Isolated Soul.\nEdition 1 of 1 Dimensions: 4000x5000",
