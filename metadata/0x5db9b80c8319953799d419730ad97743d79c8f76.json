    "description": "Trained as a physicist, Herbert W. Franke explored the aesthetic possibilities of mathematics. The revolution of quantum mechanics showed that our world is fundamentally subjective and conditional, at odds with our everyday experience. My series Glass is an attempt to visualise the quantum world, and in so doing build intuition for the mathematics that it tells us describes reality.\n\nHere I present a number of studies for Glass. Geometric forms suggest tangible structures, but without the possibility of stitching these into a cohesive whole. We are obliged to take the image as a composite of possibilities, as our own world is.\n\nReleased on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke.",
