    "description": "1/1 by Burnish. A cold winter weekday morning on the California coast. It's so hard to leave your bed when it's cold and dark, but quiet mornings like this when you're the only person in sight make it worth it. The only sounds were the crashing of the ocean waves, and a raptor calling in the distance. California's green season is the winter, if we get rain, and the recent storms have brought much-needed water to this beautiful landscape.",
