    "description": "Took me a few weeks to figure out the style of the render but I'm extremely happy with it, no cap. I really like noir and this hand thing so I just did it. Art to me is about making cool looking shit and I think I made some cool looking shit. At first I wanted something widescreenish but then I was experimenting with black borders and was like \"Shit this looks cool\" and I kept it that way (If you look carefully there is some despersion on the borders, sorry for the spoiler). Unforunately preview looks like ass but it is what it is. Hope you enjoyed reading this and the art, have a nice day :)\n\nFile is 3784 by 1620",
