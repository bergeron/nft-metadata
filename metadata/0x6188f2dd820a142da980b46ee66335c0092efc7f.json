    "description": "It was a hide and sought game one morning in Lago Misurina. She was using the clouds to cover herself from me completely. But from the movement of the clouds, I knew there would be a brief opening. So I waited for that small window of opportunity. After a long wait, she finally revealed herself. I was able to get a couple of shots before she went hiding again.",
