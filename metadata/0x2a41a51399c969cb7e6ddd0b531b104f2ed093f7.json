    "description": "This artwork is a special tribute to all the free women around the world , and Mahsa Amini is the symbol here representating Iran and the powerful voice of its women seeking freedom.\n\nShe wanted to create her own path, she never wanted to look back in regrets. When the whole world told her to sit still, she kept walking; they told her to whisper- she screamed back- for her freedom. She knew her worth, she embraced her power. She didn't let them rewrite her story, she chose it herself. \nWhen the world got burnt down in hatred, in fire- she got herself built from it, she held the fire stronger in her - forever. \nNow we are marching on, with Mahsa's voice within us, carrying that fire within us. \n\nWe stand with the brave Iranians who fight for their freedom.\n\nArtist: Ehsan Nasri  \nMember: NABU LINES family\n\nNote: this NFT is a free claim/airdrop for raising awareness and cultural purposes.",
