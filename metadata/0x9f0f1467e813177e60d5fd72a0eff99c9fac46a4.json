    "description": "The expeditions of Voldemārs Johansons to the arctic terrains of the Northern hemisphere – North of Norway, the Faroe Islands, and the Svalbard archipelago, were the starting point for his solo show \"Storm Sees No Colour\". The ecosystems of these regions are rapidly changing and even the most optimistic forecasts predict that already in the near future we can expect ice at the North Pole to melt completely during summertime. In this exhibition, the artist explores the ways in which the transitory experience of this environment can captured within an image. The photographs observe and document the arctic landscape of today – mountain ranges, the glacial terrain and the rough surface of the land, the melting of ice, and the flow of waters. Images in the collection are shot on medium format film. ",
