    "description": "Presence is a collection about nostalgia, melancholy and living in the moment.  What do memories mean when the people we made them with are no longer here? If time compresses in our heads then why do we feel the effects of old events just as strongly years after they happened? What happens to the old memories when we make new ones? All of these questions have been at the back of my mind for a long time. \n\nPresence was created over the course of a month between mid June 2022 and mid July 2022. ",
