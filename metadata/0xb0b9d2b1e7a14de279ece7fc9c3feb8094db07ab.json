How to reflect that part of your personality as you transition into the metaverse.\nSuch deconstruction of a cultural code elements makes you realize which images appeal to you loudly and distinctively, which ones are only whispering their allusions and what has already started to utterly deteriorate and lose it's primary meaning. You need to find your own pure essence to be ready for transition in web 3.0\n",
