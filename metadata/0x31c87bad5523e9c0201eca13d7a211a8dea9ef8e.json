    "description": "TROPICAL NIGHT is a 3D dance piece inspired by Capoeira movements, the lights of Latin nights and the glitter of allegorical sequins.\n\nCreated by mixing the language of dance with animation techniques and 3D simulation.\n\nWith TROPICAL NIGHT I keep asking: how to dance in Web 3.0? How to choreograph in the metaverse? How to reprocess the revolution brought about by the relationship between dance and 3D simulation? As a dance artist, I seek creative answers to these questions by articulating dance and 3D, NFTs, web3 and metaverses, provoking a dialogue between the classic and the contemporary and reflecting on the future of Art and Dance. Other bodies, other movements, other dances.\n\nArtist: Diego Mac\nDuration: 2'\nMusic: Szegvari (CC0)\nMP4 | 1920x1080\nCollector receives high quality version.",
