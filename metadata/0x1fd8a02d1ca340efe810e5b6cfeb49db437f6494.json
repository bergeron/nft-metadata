    "name": "Yawanawa Sacred Village by Refik Anadol(Scorpios Collection)",
    "description": "The artwork series is co-created by Refik Anadol and the community, using Yawanawa natural and cultural heritage. To bring this work to life, Refik Anadol Studio is devising a special computational architectural model to create an artwork that reflects the essence of the Yawanawa culture of connection with the forest, dynamically responding to real-time data influx from the Amazon. The artwork series’ sale is set up with a creator share of 80%, and a platform partner share of 20%. The artist Refik Anadol and project initiator Impact One are waiving their full share of the revenues, to dedicate the full creator’s share to the Yawanawa community.",
