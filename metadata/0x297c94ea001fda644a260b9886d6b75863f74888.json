    "name": "人 - The Bamboo Ballet",
    "description": "Bamboo scaffolding is still widely used in Hong Kong construction for its light weight, low cost, and high tensile strength. Two different types of bamboo are used - gaozhu 篙竹, a thin, flexible species, and maozhu 毛竹, which is usually thicker and sturdier. Each piece needs to be manually bound to the surrounding pieces to maintain strength and avoid bending. If this is done correctly, the scaffold lattice can be sturdier and lighter than steel. \n\nIn this '人 - People' image, several builders take part in a 'ballet' of bamboo, carefully deconstructing each length of bamboo before passing it down to be stored in a makeshift shelf on the side of the building. Their moves are coordinated and precise, with each member of the chain working with the others to dismantle the structure.\n\nThis artwork 1/1 edition and is part of the '人 - People' series, a collection of aerial photographs focusing on the capture of humans and human interaction.\n\nThis image was taken on 4th January 2022.\n",
