    "description": "\n\nTo today I have reached, I believed yesterday destined. Yesterday(s) were somehow so heavy yet some might be light  \n- that is how the world and life go on to. I still hope tomorrow especially by this year would be nice to me to the best.\n\nI projected and finished this art work by an idea of spreading uncountable dreamy rabbits jumping around. And, from bird eye view, you might notice that those cutie fluffy rabbits are together mingling up to the skies as a cloud for that little girl to reach her dreams.\n\nI also believed that everyone out there has their own dreams whether they are big or small, they need to be accomplished… of course the path to the day we have been waiting for is uneven, not painted by flowers and candles. JUST KEEP MOVING with brave heart, love and determination, there is always light shining at the end of the road as I am now waving that light with pride waiting for you. \n\nI do hope this art work could at least inspire all of you guys to dare to dream and overcome all upcoming struggles. \n\nI did it!, so you do",
