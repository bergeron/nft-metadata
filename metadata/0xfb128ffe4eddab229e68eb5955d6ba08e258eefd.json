    "description": "This piece represents two of the most forceful and dynamic elements of life in New York City, density and motion. \n\nNew York is an ever-changing, moving, living organism. A tightly packed metropolis filled with millions of moving parts, each with its own story. \n\nDuring this trip, I felt a sudden realization of the scope of this city, and coming from an upbringing in Utah I found the contrast fascinating. \n\nThis piece is my effort in capturing the density and motion of New York City; a place that was instrumental in broadening my perspective of the world, and driving my growth as a photographer.",
