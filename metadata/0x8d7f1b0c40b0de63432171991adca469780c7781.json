    "description": "This piece of artwork is called \"Is it a bubble\" in which i have created a portrait inside a bubble, showing one face with multiple personalities.\n\nSometimes thats the feeling we get, when we cant express the real thing we are feeling but begin to lie about it but in reality we are feeling completely different.\nThats the main idea of this painting, And heavily Inspired by the Movie Bladerunner 2049.\n\nProcess is available at : www.twitter.com/classypaints",
