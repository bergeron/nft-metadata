    "description": "“There’s something about your embrace that just let’s me know that everything will be alright. For that short moment, nothing else matters… Time stops. It’s just me and you. Then that moment comes to an abrupt end as soon as we release our holds on each other and we go our separate ways. I wish we’d never have to let go.\n\nTime moves too slow when we’re apart. Why do we have to let go? Why can’t we just stay right here in each others arms? Stop the time so I don’t have to go through waiting so long to hold you in my arms again. I don’t know when I’ll be seeing you again, but when that time, finally comes… I promise I’ll never let go.”\n\nDigital Painting by IZA",
