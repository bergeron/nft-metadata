    "description": "Margarita Simonyan is a lying, corrupt propagandist funded by the Kremlin regime. She has the blood of innocent people on her hands. It is impossible to imagine how much hatred and fear the media she controls generate. It's shocking how one person can lie so brazenly and shamelessly.\n\nNever listen to Margarita's nonsense. She is the reason we would like hell to exist.\n\nAlways double-check any information, read several sources, conduct fact-checking!",
