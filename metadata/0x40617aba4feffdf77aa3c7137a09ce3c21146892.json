    "description": "This is an image created in the times of the lockdown for an on-line community competition. It is clearly inspired by a 19th century classic painting by Jacques-Louis David. Let this be the only obvious thing said and the image speaks the rest. This is my first NFT minted on foundation because it is the image that granted me an invite from a fellow 3d artist. Thank you and enjoy the art!",
