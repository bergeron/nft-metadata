    "description": "We often see life as a two point path, but the real thing is that once we are born is not a straight line with an end goal that is death, we create so many roads on our life, and we don't realize how impactful is in our environment, in other people lives, we create memories through our consciousness, and we left them in the world to be remembered, we plant a seed with every decision we make, with every word we say, every kiss, we are so much more than a physical form walking, we are all connected in a network of energy that is never gone even after the life as we know ends.",
