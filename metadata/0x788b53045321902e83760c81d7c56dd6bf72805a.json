    "description": "Popularly from North of the Indian state Kerala, \"Theyyam\" primarily revolves around storytelling by means of dance, music and memes. Spectators are presented with a great performance that is a mix of myth, belief and fantasy. \n\nFor me, watching \"Theyyam\" this time,  was all about the shades of color associated with it and the emotion it associated with. Closely inspecting, \"Theyyam\" is full of monotonous red, yet it offers a variety of the same color over and over. From the face paint to attire to the fire, everything offers shades of red except the brief fresh tone of sliver, white, yellow. \n\nHere the performer is perplexed by the flame, its ferociousness. The surprise on his red-painted face was of submission before the flaring, raging sparks of fire; it was a blend of red and yellow, more dominating him. \n\nThe power play in the performance is captured through the perspective of a camera.\n\n\nEdition : 1/1",
