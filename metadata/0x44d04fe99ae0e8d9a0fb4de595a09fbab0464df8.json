    "description": "I have arrived after a long lonesome journey\nSo many reasons to give up\nTo let the darkness in\nMy one companion \nPressed warmly to my heart\nReminding me of better days to come\nOne foot in front of the other\nI kept going\nNow I’m here\nThe traveler and the destination\nIt was always one and the same",
