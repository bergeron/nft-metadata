    "description": "«« welcome my dear friend »»\n\n‍this is part 1/6 of my first nft project.\n\nas you know, i have spent the last year in a period of deep introspection and healing. along the way i was confronted with limiting beliefs and patterns that i chose to release. for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, i felt inspired to write. i wrote about my experience — stepping out of a life governed by fear and control, stepping into a life grounded in trust and love. while i wrote, i remembered my deep love of creation and storytelling. the act of spilling my heart on paper became a feedback loop of inspiration. i became my own muse. this creative process became the extension of my journey. \n\nthank you for supporting. °…°",
