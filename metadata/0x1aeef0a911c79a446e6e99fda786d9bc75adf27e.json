    "description": "It was Eid 2022 & early in the morning I took this shot after staying up the whole night. I saw thousands of men gathered in the mosque and praying to their God for the well-being of their family and close oneâ€™s. \n\nA lot of the times men are symbolized as power with muscles who are just there to protect and fight. Emotions are not correlated with men a lot. \n\nBut that day I saw thousands of them breaking down in tears of ecstasy while worshiping their creator. They hugged each other to express warmth & love that they carry in their heart. The moment in itself was surreal.\n\nLICENSE:\nExtended Editorial: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings.
