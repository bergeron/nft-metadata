    "description": "About the artist:\nJust a weird momma making art, playing video games, and trying to befriend the crows in her Texas neighborhood. She has a degree in graphic design and fine art photography but has also tried her hand at most hobbies and art styles. Her current work goes mostly back and forth between historical photography printing methods (cyanotypes for the most part) and collaborative art with various AI art generators (this is where she really puts her Photoshop and art history knowledge to good use), with some illustrations thrown in for good measure.",
