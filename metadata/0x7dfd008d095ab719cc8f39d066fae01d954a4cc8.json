    "description": "_And you always end up so far away\nthat the distance between us turns into a dense veil of fish-clouds.\nBehind this veil - the phases of the moon - they merge into a bright pulsating point in my solar plexus.\nThe moonlight becomes so hot that it melts and spreads in a thin white line on the water.\nBehind this veil - cities, trees, tram tracks, roads, crowds of people, glass, asphalt, skin.\nHurts. Sounds, letters. I turn back into letters. You turn back into sounds again._",
