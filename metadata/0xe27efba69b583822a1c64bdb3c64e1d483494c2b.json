    "description": "This is a picture of the first-ever doubles on a handrail, shot on the campus of MIT in Cambridge, Mass., in Oct. 1995: Charlie WIlkins (front) doing a smith grind and Mike Bell doing a lipslide. \n\nHard to believe this wasn't a cover, but itâ€™s still a piece of skateboarding history. I'd liken it to the first vert doubles, except it took almost 20 years for two more skaters to pull this off!\n\nGotta love that East Coast ingenuity and dedication!",
