    "description": "Touching is the negotiation of that thin membrane where ego interrupts and the world begins; an important sensorial means through which we can stop the world, both outside and within ourselves.\nThrough touching we can access many worlds: our world, others' worlds, but mostly the world hidden in oneself.\nTo touch, something that happens within the dermal boundaries of individuals, offers the possibility to understand said limits: we are both linked and separated entities, embedded in the uncertainty of the world.\n",
