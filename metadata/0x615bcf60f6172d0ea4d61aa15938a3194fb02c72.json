Time stands still, past and present dissolve, and the light remains...\n\n\"Mana Leo Iki\" (Spirits Speak Softly):  \nA collection of landscapes that explore the mystery between moments and the language of light at night. Long exposures were used as a way to connect with a spiritual element and a sense of mystery. \n\nHawaii is known for its natural splendor and bright tropical colors. I was interested in a different way of seeing. A practice of patience, presence and intuition. I walked trails at night on the East end of Oahu until these images spoke to me. The series is titled in Hawaiian to reflect the spirit of the islands and the poetry I experienced creating each image.\n\n35mm Fuji Superia 400/800 scanned and digitized\n\nJPEG image - 37.6 MB Dimensions: 5495 × 3493 Resolution: 300 × 300\n\nwith Gratitude & Seaspiration",
