CrypToadz out there ganged-up in a troop.\n\nFor updates on this road map of this collection, please follow https://twitter.com/zamees.\n\nThis idea began by wanting to teach myself Illustrator, so I started asking Cryptoadz owners if they'd like their toadz \"zameesified.\" As I got into the intricacies of the art, I also began developing a style...and it just keeps !vibing.\n\n52 toadz were used in this piece (11 of them newly created in The Zamees Labz) with some halves and pieces on the edges.\n\nThis is the first piece: toadz in LIFE > strife > dead > resurrected.\n\nThese pieces may (or may not) be relevant later...",
