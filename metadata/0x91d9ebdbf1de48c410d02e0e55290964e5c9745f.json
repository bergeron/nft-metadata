It represents the end of the “modern age” and our accelerating approach towards the Singularity, or the Neo Modern Age. The sunken CRT monitor is indicative of the post 9/11 internet society, and the fractal spiral orbs above and glowing doorway in the distance represents the approaching Epoch and our invitation to ascension. The whole scene being framed by the Roman pillars is symbolic of the enduring beauty of aesthetics through our transition technologically, societally and spiritually. \n \n *** \n **Get To Know Vapor95** \n \n Vapor95 is a Los Angeles based team of Vaporwave enthusiasts.
