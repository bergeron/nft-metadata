    "description": "Fog on the Blue Ridge Parkway\n\nThe Blue Ridge Parkway is one of the most scenic drives in Virginia.  It cuts through the mountains on a windy road with overlooks and it epitomizes the culture of the Appalachians.  Every fall, leaf peepers flock to the parkway to get scenic vistas filled will gold, yellow, and red foliage.  Sadly, this day was not filled with vistas.  It was filled with fog.  I wanted to capture the fog and also what little fall color I could see.  Stepping into the road was dangerous as there could be a car coming around the corner that I couldn't see and couldn't see me.  I kneeled down and snapped a few frames.  This shot ended up being my favorite.  The leading lines, the fog, the color: perfection.  Not what I came for, but it was well worth it.  \n\nEdition of 10\n\nLocation: Peaks of Otter, Virginia\n\nYear Created: 2020\n\nGenre: Photography\n\nExtended Editorial License: Can be used to display privately, or in commercial and non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
