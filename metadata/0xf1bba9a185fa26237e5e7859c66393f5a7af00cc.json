    "name": "RED GEISHA",
    "description": "\nGeisha are traditional Japanese Artist-entertainers. Geisha were very common in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still present today, though not in great numbers. A Geisha must be able to mastering several types of arts, which are generally traditional Japanese dance, singing, literature, poetry, flower arranging, and playing traditional musical instruments. In addition to entertaining through art, Geisha must also have a broad general knowledge. Geisha profession is actually closely related to the world of prostitution, especially in the west. However, Geisha are never actually prostitutes. Its reputation in Okiya is distinguished only by its excellence in entertainment, namely traditional Japanese Arts. So the assumption that many people have about Geisha who are prostitutes, is actually very ‘WRONG’. Combines many colors that have many deep meanings.\n\nDimensions: 3177x 4000\nFormat: JPEG\n",
