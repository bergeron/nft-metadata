    "description": "Once again I am drawn to this location. All landscape photographers have go to spots. Some we hit weekly while others only occasionally. This spot though, well, it is only 15 minutes from my house, it shoots great in all seasons Both morning and evening AND its a great spot to photograph the aurora. I go here to shoot often.\n\n\nI love this location because it is diverse. I think sometimes we can be pulled into shooting a location from the same perspective. It is easy when you know that composition works. What is so wonderful about this spot is the I have shot dozens of photos here all within 100m and many you cannot tell it is the same place. \n\n\nFire in the Sky is one of many lovely photos I have shot in this easy, ‘go to’ location. I have learned to find diversity in a spot that can be exceptionally plain. \n\n\nExtended Editorial License:  \nCan be used to display privately, or non-commercial settings, or in groups with an unlimited number of participants.
