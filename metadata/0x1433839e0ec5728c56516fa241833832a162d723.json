    "description": "Have any of us ever thought about the nature of the ocean is amazing: its waters inhabit about seventy forms of all existing life forms on our planet, and scientists are constantly discovering new species not only of small, but also of large size.\nThe ocean is a separate world that is not entirely known to man. This mysteriousness and unfamiliarity caused the author to have feelings which he depicted in this picture.\nWill send this art to new owner.\n\nP.s thanks you for visit my collection. I will very happy if this art takes you off the coast of the ocean to enjoy these emotions.\n",
