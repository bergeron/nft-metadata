    "name": "Buddha on Neptune",
    "description": "Resolution: 3000 * 3000 pixels\nOne of a kind Buddha rest for eternity on Neptune. This is a piece of a big puzzle that tells the story of the transcendence of Buddha and the Human Being.\n\nThis digital art piece is just one of the series of collections about planets on the solar system and how life would be on those planets. \n\nBuddha on Neptune is the first of this collection which represents a sci-fi world in which humanity needs to transcend to reach at Buddha's level.\n\nThe Color Blue is the dominant color of Neptune which is depicted in this art piece.\n\nProcess: I have used Zbrush to model and then I used Vray to render. After that, I painted over it with Procreate on Ipad.",
