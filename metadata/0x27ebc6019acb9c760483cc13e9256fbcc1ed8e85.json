    "description": "The Flower of Immortality ring represents the infinite desire to live, prosper and arise from any circumstances. Inspired by Ukrainian people, their incredible power, unity and strong belief in freedom and the sovereign state of each country in the world. The classic blue enamel is evocative of the vast sky and streams found throughout Ukraineâ€™s nation, while the warming yellow sapphire symbolizes the prosperity and many wheat fields found throughout the country. This ring is a unique one-of-one piece by POCHE that will never be created again. 15% of primary sale proceeds will be donated to The Ukraine Emergency Response Fund. Note: The Digital Love on the Blockchain earrings exist only in the digital world.",
