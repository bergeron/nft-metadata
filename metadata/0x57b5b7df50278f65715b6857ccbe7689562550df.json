    "description": "Macro photography of a garden orb weaver spider molting (shedding it's skin). A spider's exoskeleton doesn't change size and grow with the spider. So as the spider grows, it periodically sheds the old exoskeleton to make room.\n\nThis shot was taken outside on a breezy night, and I found this spider when it was already near the end of the process. It was tough to get the settings, lighting, focus and depth of field right, while it moved around in the wind with limited time.",
