    "name": "An Absurd Hero",
    "description": "According to Albert Camus, the person who can truly know that life is absurd and get through it with a smile is an Absurd Hero. “We must imagine Sisyphus happy,” he tells us, for the absurd hero is able to carry out a life as meaningless as eternally rolling a boulder up a hill and find enjoyment in it anyway. An Absurd Hero absurdly illustrates this, consisting of a “Grinning Face With Sweat” emoji cushion being put through endless cycles in a tumble dryer.",
