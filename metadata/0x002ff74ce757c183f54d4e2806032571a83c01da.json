    "description": "We all have roots. We all have a history behind our backs. It contains not only our lives but the lives of those who came before us. You might not remember, but Grandfather Tree remembers. Nothing goes unnoticed by him. He is watching you through the leaves. Are you ready to meet him? Are you ready to hear him? \nThis piece is a collaboration between\n@HoBGRecords\n and \n@slyulchak\n This HoBG orchestral composition inspired Svetlana to paint this piece and start this collection. Art made with oil pastels on paper is one of a kind. Subtle HoBG animation brings it to life. enjoy.",
