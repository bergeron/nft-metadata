    "description": "De'vine feminine is a series of intimate photographs based off of self love and appreciation for ones body. It is easy to pick at all the details when you look at yourself everyday but it is not until you truly love yourself that none of that seems to matter anymore. That is the reasoning behind the frequently common misspelling of the word 'divine'. Such a simple flaw that can be easily overlooked. \n\nPhase 1 : \nWith the purchase of each\n'de'vine feminine : Phase 1' piece you will receive a plexiglass print to be able to display wherever you'd like. \n\nHolding these de'vine feminine pieces will give you perks in the future including airdrops for Phase 1 holder only and access to future drops by artist Chris Allmeid. \n\nDe'vine feminine #1 , 2021\n",
