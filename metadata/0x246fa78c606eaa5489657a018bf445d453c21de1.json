    "description": "It was a cloudy sunset in spring, just a week after this first calf of the season was born. After dinner I had some time to visit the Teddycows and I was hoping to find the the blond calf. I found him with his family at the edge of the forest and I could see it was already bigger than the first time I saw it. Because it was cloudy there was little light, but just enough to highlight his blond fur and create this incredible mysterious contrast with the dark surroundings. It was the first time that I was able to capture a Teddycow in a dark setting like this and that I got this opportunity with a little blond calf makes this moment even more special. The little forest ghost was born.\n\nArtist: Nick Bng  \nLocation: Posbank, The Netherlands  \nEdition Size: 50",
