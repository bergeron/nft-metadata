    "description": "During the observation of the pork butchering process, I was questioning the existence of our lives. Our bodies are so mysterious next to the pig carcass, comparing ourselves to the insides of that pigs.The smell and blood covering the butcher and then I think that we're not much different when we died.\n\nSo, I decided to shoot the whole scene as if it's a documentary to show the rawness of the human body and pig carcass. Black-and-white with juxtaposition was also used to express the similarity between these bodies. We're the same, humans or pigs, just a pack of meat waiting for the day to die and rotten.",
