    "description": "At times of transformation we should all be looking to disrupt incumbent ways of doing things: to invent new models, modes and techniques. Interested in the workings of the unconscious mind, in juxtapositions and coincidences, in everyday strangeness, and passionate about building the culture of the future, I create the \"Time and Again\" series. This collection powered by the AI is an invitation to explore the bewitching and unstoppable mind of the machine guided by my vision.\n\nJPG | 4500 x 8000 | Roger Haus | 2022 | AI Art",
