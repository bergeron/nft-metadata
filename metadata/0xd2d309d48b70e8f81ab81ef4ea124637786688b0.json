    "description": "It was a late summer storm, and I had decided to venture out to the local bay to check what was brewing. I never in a million years imagined that I would be able to feel what it is like to catch a lightning bolt for the very first time. It wasn't until much later, when I had gone through all the images that some fantastic shots were able to be captured. This shot stands out from the others because I could capture an incredible moment. Still, I also made it out of the situation unscathed without damaging my equipment.\n\nI'm delighted with how well this photograph turned out, considering all the obstacles I faced while photographing a double-bolt strike.\n\nThis is a bolt from the blue!",
