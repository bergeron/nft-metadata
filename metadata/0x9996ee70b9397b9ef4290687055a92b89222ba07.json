    "description": "Pop-art fractal.\n\nMeditative fractal distortions. Experiments with different fractal formulas and structures. In this series, I concentrate especially on the abstract visual face of mathematics. Everything you see — generated by a computer. As an artist, I just drive the process and make the final decision on when to stop the computation. The result is pure abstraction, generated by artificial intelligence, driven by the human. The most popular duet of the XXI century.\n\nDigital versions are relaxing 2 min loops of complex structures slowly flowing in front of the viewer. While everything around is flashing and sparking, trying to catch our attention, this experience can be compared to watching clouds or landscapes. Eye-candy practice after an intense day. \n\n—\nThe buyer also will receive an ultra-high-definition 2 min video at a higher bitrate. Ideal for modern TVs and displays.\n3840x2160 px, 60 fps.",
