    "description": "SPIRAL #1 - Blood Coral\n\nIts the deep connection of life, vitality, wellness and prosperity. And it touches the very root of our energy. This indicates a sense of belonging, increased self-esteem and integrity.\n\nThere is always something so obscure about the human mind. Sometimes, it can be pretentious, and sometimes, it can trick itself. There can be traps, loops, ideas, and emotions.\n\nHuman emotions are different at their core across minds. But everything focuses on a single point of axis. They may vary, but it's often looped and spiralled.\n\nCollection: Spiral\nArt type: Generative \nDimension: 1400 x 1400\nCreated using: p5.js",
