    "description": "As the sun set in Yellowstone we made one last frantic attempt to catch the sights in the long summer twilight. In this National Park, beautiful sights can be seen in any direction. But, as Houston roams with his camera, we are never certain just what he has captured until we are safe at home. \n\nThis image surprised everyone. Somehow between the pine trees, he captured the rising mist as it appears to be forming a “ghost tree.” \n\nHouston is always surprising us and those around him. The dire predictions he received at birth have been blown away. He is able to do so much more than anyone anticipated. \n\nIn this image, the ghost tree is a perfect representation of things that are not always seen but are there all along.",
