    "description": "«Where Do You Think You're Going?»‎, Part 1 in «Rug n Roll» collection - by Axelroode.\n\nIt's a captivating piece of digital art, an NFT on the Ethereum chain. Rendered in a 1420x1420 pixel GIF animation, the artwork channels the textural energy of Van Gogh's oil painting style, yet entirely reimagined for the age of cryptocurrency.\n\n«Where Do You Think You're Going?» is a deeply personal reflection of the artist's own experiences as a holder and trader, as well as a snapshot of the current market scenario. It captures not just a moment, but a mindset. It's a piece that brings a smile, a nod of recognition from those who understand the thrilling, yet often disappointing, journey of a 'degen'. A potent symbol of the relentless spirit, the unfounded hope, and the inevitable losses in the crypto world.\"",
