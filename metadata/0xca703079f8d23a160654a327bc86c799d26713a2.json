    "description": "Pristine, beautiful and colorful nature along with contradictions has always created a special effect, in all areas of life, even we can feel it in the rhythm of the heartbeat, these contradictions are quite evident and create life in general.\nIn my painting, the glow of light in the center next to the sky indicates this contrast, and lofty mountains shows endurance and patience, and the tame horses indicate our deliverance and calm minds trough all challenges.\nOur mind may be calmly or loaf oneâ€™s away during all situations. Which one do we choose? However, living alongside these contradictions paint our life and it is so beautiful.\n",
