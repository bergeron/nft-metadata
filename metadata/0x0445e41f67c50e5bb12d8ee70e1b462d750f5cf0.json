    "description": "\nThe first Open Edition from FroggyCyborg, The Penguinsâ€™ Triumphant celebrates the one-year anniversary of the brand under new leadership. The four great Pudgys are depicted leading the charge of the Web3 cultural wave.\n\nThe fluid lines across the image establish a subtle vibrant tone, against which the artist silhouettes and overlaps the powerful forms of the four horses and Pudgy riders to command attention to the center of the artwork. The throng of Web2 characters laying defeated across the bottom of the image captures the essence of change and triumph in the digital space.",
