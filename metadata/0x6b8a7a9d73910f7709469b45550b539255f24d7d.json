    "description": "Chief's Log:\n\nThe night is chilly and the full moon of winter has yet to rise. Stars dot initity as would the celestial memories that glow upon the vacuous void of my own mind. \n\nOn the horizon, the glow of a distant kingdom casts spirited hues of gold upon the glassy surface of the sea, tempting me towards the shore with whispers of happiness and riches to come. \n\nGhosts haunt me, appartions upon the waves, echos wailing across the rippling wake to one day crash as I have upon foreign shores. \n\nOn this night, the glowing sun of my career set upon the saltwater horizon, and in a flash of green, left me to the cold, cold dark of the starry sky's farewell.
