    "description": "Women's fights are often the most intense for me, as if victory isn't enough, as if something more has to be proven. Women have successfully established their place in this patriarchal sport, free from discrimination and ignorance. There are no women or men in the ring; only fighters. \n\nIn this fight between Marie Priolau (right) and Jennifer Trioreau (left), which took place in Avignon in June 2018, the latter won on points after three rounds of a rare intensity.",
