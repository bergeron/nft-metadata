    "description": "In the cosmos, there emerges a unique source of unlimited power: the act of viewing one's surroundings from the highest point. Just when one unleashes their potential, the connection between the cosmos and oneself becomes a reality. Each part that makes up the whole is transformed with divine force. \"Gratitude\" symbolizes integrity, self-reliance, and a high understanding of inner power that expands one's divine energy infinitely.\n\n",
