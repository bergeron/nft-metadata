    "description": "In the journey to the top, we draw motivation to forge forward from our huge dreams. With such desires comes self-made expectations wrapped around our heads engulfing us with stifling pressure. This entanglement borne from our many wishes, our many desires becomes what chokes us through the journey, oh! how our motivations also became pressures that chokes air out of us. When everything stifles, when breathing becomes barely bearable, and diving smothers, dear friend remember to pause, unlatch yourself from this expectations and take a breather, a fresh air is the fuel to going even farther.",
