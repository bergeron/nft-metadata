    "description": "In Two Minds explores the use of synthetic light and texture to formulate a visual representation of a conflicted mind. \n\nThe beauty of inner enquiry, of organic thought and then shifting to learned, structural thought. The former being instinctive and the latter built and designed.\n\nThe juxtaposition of two minds in one being. Be it android, human or other.\n\n\n4724px x 4724px",
