    "description": "\"Who are you? Are you a reflection of society or your own resistance? Does your shadow belong to you, or is it even an imposition on you? Your tastes, your desires, your prejudices, your anger. Why do I love something? Why do I hate it? I find myself asking these questions all the time. I am constantly questioning. Now I feel without an identity. When I don't question, I feel like a copy and aimless. I know that being surrounded by thoughts that I don't belong doesn't make me any less me. I need to purify, tighten the stitches.\"",
