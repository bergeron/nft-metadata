    "description": "My life is a canvas and I am the art. Being an artist isn't just about putting pencil to paper, or brush to canvas. Art can and does mean so much more than that, to so many people and it does to me. This artwork shows the many personalities I have got and my story which I cannot explain in words. I am compelled to observe things, sense the textures, look at the colors , to make things: to draw, paint, and take photographs. I dream in artistic land. I love seeing what others are creating . I see patterns and colors before I read words. Everything around me is trying to convey a story to me and I m here to listen to it. This collection showcases my personality , my nature and my surroundings. And what you see and how you perceive my art is just like another chapter / version to my story .",
