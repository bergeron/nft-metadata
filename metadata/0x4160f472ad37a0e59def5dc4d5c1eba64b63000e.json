    "description": "The year is 2020, and the smell of lawlessness in the atmosphere reeks like a dumpster. Racism is slowly becoming a public act of pride, recession is turning into the normal state of living, and wars continue to separate countries from peace. With the state of the world, Khepera was not able to find any tranquility in anything they did. They began to have dreams of the future that looked more like vivid nightmares. Sleepless nights were always met with the question of how to restore the state of the world back to a place of order and integrity. Until one day they went into a psychedelic induced trance and was met in the ethers by the Yoruba goddess Oshun, who had a divine plan to save humanity. She took Khepera on a trip to Venus, and when they returned to Earth in 2020 their name was different. DeLady Khepera: non-binary, clairvoyant, waterbending, superhero on a mission to restore the state of humanity back to a place of balance and harmony. ",
