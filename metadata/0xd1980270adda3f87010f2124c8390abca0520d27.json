    "description": "It's Saturday evening, a few hours after your usual curfew, yet you are still fully awake. Awake and full of adrenaline rush. \nA few hours ago, you and your siblings enthusiastically sat around a table and decided to play a game of the newest edition of Monopoly.\nYou quickly grasped the rules of this new release and started playing, minting NFTs and staking wooden chips and tokens all over the playing board.\n\nIt didn't take long and the game got intense, with everyone stealing out of each others' game wallets and the game itself destroying all of your holdings at any given moment makes you want to scream and cry all the time. You are desperate and you hate the game. And most of all, you hate your siblings because they got you rekt so bad.\n\nThe screaming and fighting goes on until your mom appears in the artificial light of your living room and tells you to go to bed. But how can you sleep when your nemesis lies on the bunkbed right above you? This game is no fun at all.",
