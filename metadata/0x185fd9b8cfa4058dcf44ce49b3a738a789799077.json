    "description": "Puppies and Rainbows is a voxel sculpture comprised of 289 individual voxel models. This piece as a visual representation of what it was like for me when the clouds of depression began to lift. Still a little gray and hazy, but there are some bright pretty things emerging. Not everyday is a win. Some days you're on top of the world and everything feels great, somedays you tumble down the mountain, smashing your face on every rock and breaking your appendages on every tree and vine that snags you as you fall to what feels like drowning in an ocean of complete despair. If you zoom out though, the big picture isn't half bad.\n\nCreated in MagicaVoxel  \nEdited in Adobe Photoshop  \nFinished in Adobe Lightroom",
