    "description": "Descending of the moon is a piece based on an impression I had in mind, \nAs an unholy incident, a tragic act of cruelty and\nA sin... \ndemonstrating a death scene \nThe moment of suffering that's about to perish... \nAwakened by greed, \nHis soul is leaving the wretched flesh, \nA gentle touch out of regret, \nThe unforgivable guilt has been accrued...\n\nThe process of the creating was simply influenced by great master Caravaggio\nI tried to imitate his way of creating in my own way\nSo I consider this artwork as a genuine tribute to him...",
