Maybe, if you watch her for a while, you'll find out the answer.\n3DGenArt\nUnlike other more traditional forms of generative art, this collection is not based on a code designed specifically to produce lines or curves, but is the result of mixing algorithms in a 3D environment. The enormous advantage of this system is an infinite amount of variables that can be intermingled to give surprising results, always maintaining that wonderful characteristic of the generative art of achieving unpredictable and extraordinary results.
