    "name": "Hit The Bull’s Eye 2.0",
    "description": "The palm print on the golden bull is inspired by Picasso’s signature masterpiece in the Neo-classical period Two Women Running on the Beach in 1922. The painting shows two lively females holding their hands, which shows their proactive and optimistic attitude towards life. Your fate can be changed by your own hands. This piece of derivative work epitomizes that a positive attitude enables you to hit the bull’s eye.",
