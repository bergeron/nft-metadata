    "description": "The mind of the new galaxy is starting to mature. Birth begins. Every planet has an end. As time passes, the “mind” begins to be reborn in a different galaxy with a new energy. When that moment comes, every piece you will have will be the key to this galaxy. Which door will the key open?
