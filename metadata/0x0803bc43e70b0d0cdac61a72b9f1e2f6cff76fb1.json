    "description": "The Warrior is an artwork created on my smart phone Samsung s22 Ultra. It took me to draw 11 hours 48 minutes. \nCanvas Size: 1378 *1378  \nDate of Creation: January 26th, 2023.\n\nThe Warrior represents the woman who is under the oppression of old-fashioned socio-political institutions and society. The tower shaped figures behind the scene are representing the gender roles of 19th and 20th century as a reference to Freud's conceptualization. Thus, figures seem like they walk to the left, referencing to the outdated ideas. \nThe Warrior on the left side looks to the right and up, referencing to the future of the humanity and symbolizes the rise of women even though they are under the oppression of outdated cultural systems that decide in the name of women in every aspect of life. (The skull represents the outdated systems of the society that grows children for the traditions that decide the future of women without asking an individual's consent.)",
