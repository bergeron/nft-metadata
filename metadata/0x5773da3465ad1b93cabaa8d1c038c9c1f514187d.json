    "description": "This is funny somehow, I created this piece in the first months when I met my soulmate and I was very happy.\nNow I minted this piece when I am a lone soul, heartbroken. I have to recover from recovery, kind of. \n\nThis is the first time I speak loud about my feelings. Feels weird.\n\nAt least Iâ€™m proud, I can truly love, without expectations.\n\n\nðŸ”Š on\nOriginal audio: Hekathena\n",
