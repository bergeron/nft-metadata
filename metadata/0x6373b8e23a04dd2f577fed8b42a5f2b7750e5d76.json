    "description": "Dim. 3000 x 4000 pixels\n\nI like the subtlety with which life communicates with us on its most diverse planes. It sounds like a living organism that whispers in our ears when we are attentive to the moment!\n\nLike the other arts, this one appeared in a dream where I received a message from an angel saying that everything was going well.\n\nI bring in this art the feather as an archetypal element, because it represents this subtle touch that we all receive when we have our \"doors\" open to this delicate divine communication.",
