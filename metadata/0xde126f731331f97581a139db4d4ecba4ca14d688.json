    "name": "Light of Lisbon",
    "description": "Once upon a time in Lisbon, a photographer wandered the city, seeking captivating images. One sunny day, he found himself atop a hill overlooking a mesmerizing vista of the cityscape.\n\nBelow, white buildings with red rooftops gleamed under the sun's embrace. Yellow trams weaved through narrow streets, carrying cheerful passengers and the scent of past√©is de nata. His eyes were drawn to the 25 de Abril Bridge, its bold red structure contrasting brilliantly with the azure sky above, while the Tagus River shimmered beneath.\n\nWith pride and wonder, he raised his camera and captured the breathtaking scene before him. That photo became his masterpiece, encapsulating the essence of Lisbon, a city that sparkled with life and light.",
