    "description": "I remember them watching from the corner of the room. Always smiling. Always watching. Always at the peripherals of my eyes. I tried staring at them directly but everytime i do so, they dash to the corner; just enough that I can't see their shape but enough that I can see those eyes and the rows of sharp teeth lining that ever present smile. I tried ignoring them, running away from them but the more I do the closer they come.\n\nCollection Info:\n\nEver had a nightmare that wakes you up, drenched in sweat with your heart in your throat?\n\nDisturbing dream is a collection of my most vivid nightmares that I managed to sketch after waking up.",
