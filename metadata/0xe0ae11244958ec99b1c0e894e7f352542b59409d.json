    "description": "The End (For Now) explores not only a personal passing of time, but a journey through technology and mediumsÂ of storytelling. The works expand a film archive that has developed over decades from a revisited collection of individual and shared intimate family memories. The double media layering enhances the 8mm and VHS grain captured in the photographs; the black borders, which give no sense of spatial placement, push the images further into the past. \n\nThe photographs created from the film archive have been reformatted back to moving image. The series were exhibited, in the same sequence, as photographic prints at Auction House project space in Cornwall, UK. The duration of the photographs in this film are in relation to the image description and draw focus on the tension of pace. Through reverting the stills back to the source format of film and augmenting into contemporary parameters the distortion of memory and technology is explored.",
