    "description": "The concept behind this collection was to create a series of space-bars based on different musical genres, as an excuse to experiment with different shapes, colors and sounds.\n\nThe first one is perhaps the most precarious, but it’s also the most special as it’s inspired by a beautiful song from Spinetta, an amazing artist from another galaxy we were blessed to have in Argentina for a short time, but whose melodies will resonate forever in cosmos.\n\n✦ Captain Beto’s Fiberglass Ship ✦ \nA rest station for errant aliens, floating forever in the ether :)\n\nFile info: MP4 video / 2880 x 2158 px\nOriginal design and animation by Juan Casini\nMusic: Fourzy Lofi by Juan Casini\nFrom Space Cantina OST / Original Music for Aliens\n\nTags: illustration, animation, music, space, spaceship, galaxy, cosmos, sci-fi, first, debut",
