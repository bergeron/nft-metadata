    "description": "What do you dream of? \n\nI dream of winter. Soft white crystals falling from the sky, blanketing the earth. Frosted evergreens and frozen lakes. Cold nights and crisp morning air. Seeing stoked, grinning faces on chairlifts. Carving bottomless turns through snow light as the stars. Endless powder runs until my legs ache. Catching air. Hooting and hollering with friends. Exploring vast mountain terrain. Hot chocolate around the fireplace. \n\nThis edition is for all the dreamers out there. Don't be afraid to chase your dreams with a fiery passion, whatever they may be. \n\n\n\n",
