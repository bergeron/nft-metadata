    "description": "In Ohio, USA where I grew up there is a spirit in nature. Beneath the toxic sludge of industrial runoff there is a constant feeling like one can communicate with another dimension. Before the people with explosions arrived the natives communed with nature. Gunpowder is an attempt to connect our technology to nature on a deeper level. \n\nTerritorial Pissings is a series of painting collages.  Each piece in the painting collage series started as multiple paintings that were photographed in detail and digitally collaged to magnify the expression of physical mediums alongside the unique characteristics of digital editing. Creating processes that organically connect physical expression with digital expression has been a passion of mine throughout my work.\n\n",
