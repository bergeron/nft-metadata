    "description": "In 2135, Horizon Coms was created. An underground Communication Faction; designed to fight the Alpha Corps hold over the world and once again; unite the people. This was done by using a Revelation Box or RevBox, as it is most commonly known. The RevBox is a “Hyper-Connector”, which allows the user to project any place they can think of; and create a limited-time portal to that location. It is now time to unite those who remain, and take back what is ours!",
