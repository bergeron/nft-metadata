    "description": "This piece began as a photograph of a simple tree in the stunning Cherry Valley on a crisp November morning in the Midwest, when the color of the sky was cherry too. Through the artistic process and with the aid of technology, it was transformed into a stunning work of art, showcasing the beauty and potential of the creative process. The piece captures the peaceful, serene atmosphere of the location, and serves as a reminder of the endless possibilities that can be achieved through imagination and the use of technology.",
