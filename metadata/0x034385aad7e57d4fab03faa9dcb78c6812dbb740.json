    "description": "'Dioxin Posse' is a 1/1 NFT that contains digitized 35 mm slide images depicting the first six pages of Dioxin Posse, the graphic novel concept that was a precursor to Snow Crash. This NFT is a collaboration between Tony Sheeder, the artist behind Dioxin Posse, and the author Neal Stephenson. The concept was born on New Year's Eve, 1988, when Neal and Tony first discussed working together on a graphic novel. Neal drafted a story involving a skateboard courier living in a hyper-capitalist, post-national version of the near future. Featuring the 'Kourier' Yours Truly, or Y.T., this story became the source material for Dioxin Posse and, eventually, the inspiration for Snow Crash.",
