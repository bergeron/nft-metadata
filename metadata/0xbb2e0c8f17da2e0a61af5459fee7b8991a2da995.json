Retaining the basic colors of the original national uniforms, the NFT are infused with new totem creation and typeface design to add more lines to enhance the overall visual texture and ensure social recognition of each country's international team. Each Salute image represents the IP of each team's player, and each team's uniform corresponds to the star player participating in the 2022 World Cup. The designer creates a exclusive uniform for each team, so that each International team can be more integral and full of teamwork spirit. Most importantly, competition comes after friendship.
