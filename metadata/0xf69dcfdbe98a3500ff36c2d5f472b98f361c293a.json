    "description": "It is considered that the flamingo is symbol of love, but at the same time his look is harsh and he does not seem nice and kind. The girl is blind and does not see the true appearance of her lover. She holds him with one hand, thereby showing her affection for him, she cannot let him go. \nThis is a love story when people do not see the bad qualities of their partners, they blindly love, living in \"pink glasses\".",
