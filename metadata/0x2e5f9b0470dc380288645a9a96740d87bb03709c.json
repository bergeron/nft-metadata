    "description": "\"In the tapestry of existence, where distance separates souls, a realm unfolds where dreams become ethereal bridges that bind us. Through the dance of dreams and reality, the dreamer becomes a veil, concealing an eternal connection. So, let us dream, finding unity as our souls intertwine in the embrace of nocturnal visions, painting a canvas of love and longing\". â€” NB\n\nAI Surrealism exhibition, hosted by Superchief Gallery NFT x Exquisite Workers. June, 2023. Curated by Anna Dart and Roger Haus."
