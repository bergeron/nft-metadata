    "description": "my dad was diagnosed with cancer in the beginning of 2020. covid hit. and he moved back in to a cramped apartment with my mom, her wife, my sister, and myself. i made it my singular goal to educate myself on health and cancer recovery as heavily as i could to help expedite his healing. for those two years we became closer than ever. best friends. 6 mile walks every morning. learning about his upbringing, parents, first loves, fears, goals, mistakes. everything. it was the first time i understood my dad as a human. who was once a child. and a teenager. and as a son and a brother.\n\nhe moved back to his hometown after his recovery and nearing the end of the most severe months of the pandemic. i wrote this song the morning after i watched him get in the car to the airport.\n\nthis song is so special to me that i made it only available to mint in the listening room. i'm glad you found it.Â ",
