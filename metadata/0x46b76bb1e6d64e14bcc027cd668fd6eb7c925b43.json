    "description": "Floor Society is a generative art project inspired by the the different types of floors we have in our wallets. Every wallet starts off with a base floor equal to that of its first Non-Fungible Token. While most wallets probably start with floors that are pure dirt, some seem to consist of the most beautiful marble floors you have ever seen straight from the start. However, a wallet is a living thing and throughout every wallet’s lifetime its collection of floors changes. Some wallets are highly diversified, others only have a couple of floors, but all of them are beautiful in their own way. Starting from pictures of real floors, each Floor Society NFT is generatively created as a collage of different possible floors in a wallet. It’s a visual representation of what such a collection of floors could look like in real life.",
