    "description": "This portrait of Eagle Owl was created by me around October 2020, a painting is acrylic on paper.\n\nit was the firs painting of a small series called Incorporating Colors. \n\nThe artwork was created at first in neon pink and then I added more natural colors.\n\nI wanted to express that even in the things that may seem reserved, or dark, or gloomy (though I don't think owls are any of the above) - \nYou can add your meaning, your attitude to the things around you.\nAnd there's a lot of emotional color in any everyday matter.",
