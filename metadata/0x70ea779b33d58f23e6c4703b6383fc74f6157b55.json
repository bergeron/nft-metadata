    "description": "Ferrofluid is a liquid that is attracted to the poles of a magnet, It is a colloidal liquid made of nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles suspended in a carrier fluid. Ferrofluids have been historically lacking of color. The Ferrofluid Coloration Collection showcases the beauty of science and nature intertwining beautifully in fluid chaotic unity within a low gravity magnetic environment. ",
