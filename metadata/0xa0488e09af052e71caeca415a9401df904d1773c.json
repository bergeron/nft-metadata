    "description": "This work is from second phase of MLIBTY papertoy series. This phase shows what each of the papertoys was doing, before the first phase happened. \n First phase of MLIBTY papertoys was made in 2012., as a series of papertoys, which consist of ten policemen and ten detainees.  You can set the detainees free, by downloading their templates for free, while for the policemen there is symbolical fee; we all pay them anyway. The whole series is available at http://markozubak.com/mlibty. \n\nThis contract was created to experiment with other approaches in artist's digital production. Below you can find links to other platforms with his work.\nEdition: 17 | Papertoy on Blockchain | http://markozubak.com/ | https://superrare.co/MLIBTY | KnownOrigin: https://bit.ly/2N70h3S | https://opensea.io/assets/cryptoskateboards",
