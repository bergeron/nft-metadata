    "description": " In the Gada system, women are highly revered and have their own institution called “Siinqee”. This institution has the role of making sure that the rights of women are duly respected. The word “Siinqee” is derived from a thin stick that is given to an Oromo woman on her wedding day by her mother. Siinqee is an instrument to ensure the protection of women's rights and whenever these rights are transgressed or violated, women rally for demonstrations carrying their Siinqee to demand that their rights should be respected.",
