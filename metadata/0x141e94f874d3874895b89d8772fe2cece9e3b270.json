    "description": "This piece is inspired from my chronic autoimmune disorder called Ankylosing Spondylitis. It is an inflammatory disease that over time, can cause the bones in the spine to fuse. I have been dealing with this for more than 15 years.\n\nThere was a time wherein I lost my ability to walk and the doctors were not able to make me feel better so my dad tried to look for a witch doctor/faith healer (\"Albularyo\" in the Philippines) And I was told that a mythical creature fell in love with me and decided to curse me so that I would never leave her side.",
