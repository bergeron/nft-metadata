    "description": "Fathi Brak 5560m and Farhat Brak 5300m are the most beautiful rock towers in Charakusa valley of Pakistan. They are named after a couple - Fathi is the man and Farhat is the woman. Charakusa Valley is situated in the heart of Karakorum and is surrounded by magnificent mountains - The Nayser Peak (5200m), Drifica Peak (6650m), Kapura Peak (6545 m), Niza Peak, Namika (6325m), Laila Peak (6400m). They all provide unique opportunity for rock climbing.\n\nTook this photo from Spangser Campsite 12 days of trekking and climbing to capture these giants in the best possible conditions. Grateful for the experience and the ability to share it with you.\n\n“Only one mountain can know the core of another mountain.”  \n― Frida Kahlo",
