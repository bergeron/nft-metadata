    "description": "“The deep percussion of the ball when it bounces against the floor, the snapping sound of the soles of the boots on the grass, the agitated breathing, the uneven chorus of shouts, orders, warnings, insults from the guys and the sharp whistle of the referee. Well... That, that is the music...\n\nThe contrast with the Prussian blue of the rival jerseys, the almost cardinal violet that also assumes that blue due to sweat, the bright whites like wild strokes. The agile ocher, brown and sepia and siena stains on the thighs, lively, worthy of a Bacon.\nClose your eyes and appreciate it this way... Well... That, that is the painting”\n\n2010, Roberto Fontanarosa\n\n\nArgentina World Cup Champion, Qatar 2022",
