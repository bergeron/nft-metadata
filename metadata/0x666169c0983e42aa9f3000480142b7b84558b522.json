    "description": "50% of all proceeds and royalties go to Atlanticwhiteshark.org 4200x3300 @300ppi. Whitesharks are a vulnerable species that continue to need our protection from endangerment. Although many countries have banned Whiteshark fishing, not all have, and their numbers continue to dwindle. It is estimated they will be extinct within a century if nothing is done. This in turn will effect ecosystems and cause imbalances in nature that only lead to more destruction. As fierce as this flesh-eating giant may be, it is a product of our planet's life force and deserves to exist in order to maintain the diverse balances of living organisms in the ocean.\n\nHolders of J2B collectible NFTs earn 15% off of our Store savetheworldwithart.io for life, email jams2blues@savetheworldwithart.io to redeem your discount code specific to your login.
