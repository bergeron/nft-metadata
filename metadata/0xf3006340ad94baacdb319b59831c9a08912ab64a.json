    "description": "Wetware - Bacteria is a new subset of Yoshi Sodeoka’s ongoing Wetware series inspired by the concept of a ‘wetware’ computer, a self-organizing machine composed of organic matter.\n \nIn this collection, imaginary bacteria propagate and bubble deep within the system, generating the energy powering the computer. This living, dynamic, nano-mechanical engine generates feedback that fuels its own activity and development.\n",
