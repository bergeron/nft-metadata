    "description": "Last year was a year full of high anxiety and depression. It took a strain on my mental, and for the longest time I haven’t been able to cry, no matter the situation that emotion was completely cutoff! After multiple trips to help deal with my emotions it felt like I unlocked a whole new part of myself!\n\nI managed to create Lifted Demons out of darkness and this record made me feel light, it made me want to jump around and enjoy myself again. Like, it literally had been so long since I’ve seen my true self and once I did it felt like my demons had been lifted!\n\n“It’s been a long time since I seen you man, fuck is going on”\n\nWe have all dealt and maybe are still dealing with some type of darkness. I’m here to tell you keep fighting, no matter the battle. You have only yourself to prove something to!",
