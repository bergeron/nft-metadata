    "description": "'FREE SPIRIT' 1/1 by Zakaria OUAGHAD\n\nThis series was born during my road trip to the highlands, at the foot of mount 'M’Goun' at an altitude of 4071 m. \n\nIt’s where I found nature’s freedom, giving us the best postures and conditions that revives and gives the wild life a hope to thrive and keeps on nurturing.\n\nsuch as in the case with the 'Ait Atta' tribe, they move from one region to another with their herd to live in the wilderness of the atlas mountains, to do the transhumance and to continue living according to their traditions, keeping the Nomadic way alive.",
