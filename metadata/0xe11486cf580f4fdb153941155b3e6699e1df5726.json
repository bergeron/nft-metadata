    "description": "My genesis piece is fitting of a year full of reflecting and self discovery:  \nI was stuck in Sydney hotel quarantine for two weeks in April 2021 after being entangled in America for years, unable to see my family and new baby nephew in Australia.\n\nThank goddess for my online community - clubhouse and podcasts, twitter and discord. I was learning about NFT's and the dazzling new world of crypto currency and decentralized finance, eating the edibles I snuck in and dancing to music. A lot of time was spent looking out of this window into a country I had missed and still couldn't touch; creating and brainstorming ways to enter this new world we were all dipping our toes into...\n\nThis, is a reflection of that.",
