    "description": "They say a river can cut through the rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence. And, even a stone can be excavated by the slow passage of water.\nWe are often unaware of the gradual decline and the erosion in our lives but not unaware of the gnawing feeling it brings.  And again, When a stone can be excavated by the slow passage of water.\nDon't you think a human heart that's as feeble and delicate as a fetus, can be eroded?\nClinging to the truth and pain that yearns for the freedom to simply be human and experience life.\nWhy is refusing to be a puppet in the hands of those who can't even feel our worth considered a crime?",
